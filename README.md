## Task 0: Preprocessing

The preprocessing is not directly part of the assignment, but it is explained in the report and can be consulted in the program PreProcessing.java, which you can find inside the java project folder.

## Task 1: TBOX definition

The TBOX was created using the program TBOX.java, which you can find inside the java project folder. More details about the TBOX can be found in the report or in the file 'tbox.owl' inside the folder 'resources'.

## Task 2: ABOX definition

The ABOX was created using the program ABOX.java, which you can find inside the java project folder. More details about the ABOX can be found in the report or in the file 'abox.nt' inside the folder 'resources'.

## Task 3: Linking the TBOX and ABOX

This is done 'automatically' when running the program ABOX.java. If you import the files 'tbox.owl' and 'abox.nt' into GraphDB, you will see that the ABOX is linked to the TBOX.

## Task 4: SPARQL queries

The SPARQL queries can be found in the file 'B_$_queries.txt' in the base folder. More information about their functioning and results can be found in the report.

## Deliverables

The report is 'G11-Lorencio-Abu.pdf' in the base folder. 

The java project is in the folder 'sdm-lab-3' in the base folder, where you will find the different files used for the project. Nonetheless, following the specifications of the assignment, the relevant files for the project have been renamed and compied into the delivery-files folder. The files in the delivery-files folder are the following:

- G11-B-1-Lorencio-Abu.java
- G11-B-1-Lorencio-Abu.owl
- G11-B-2-Lorencio-Abu.java
- G11-B-2-Lorencio-Abu.nt
- G11-B-4-Lorencio-Abu.txt

Note that in order to test the programs, you will need to run the project.
