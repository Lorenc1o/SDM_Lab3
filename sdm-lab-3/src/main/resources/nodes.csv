Central venous catheterization (CVC) is an indispensable route of venous access in management of critically ill patients. Potential CVC related complications include mechanical and infectious complications.


OBJECTIVE
To determine type, incidence and risk factor of CVC related complications in pediatric patients.


MATERIAL AND METHOD
Prospective observational study of all patients who underwent CVC in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, over a 1-year period.


RESULTS
The study included 137 patients, of whom 63.5% were males. The mean age was 36.7 ± 4.4 months. There were 204 CVC attempts with total indwell time of 2,002 days. The rate of mechanical complication was 19%, including failure to place catheter (9.3%), hematoma (4.9%), arterial puncture (2%) and pneumothorax (1.5%). Patient body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, internal jugular venous catheterization, and longer insertion time (> 30 minutes) were associated with high mechanical complication rates. The incidence density of catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was 7.5/1,000 catheter-days. Femoral vein placement had significant higher incidence of CRBSI.


CONCLUSION
CVC related complications are comparable to previous studies. Risk factors of mechanical complications include high BMI, internal jugular venous catheterization and longer insertion time. Femoral venous catheterization is the only risk factor for CRBSI.","","","","428b19e218451467d91c3f56fcd8ea3d4267a6d8","","","","","","Central venous catheterization related complications in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/428b19e218451467d91c3f56fcd8ea3d4267a6d8","","2014"
"1",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Background The use of indwelling central venous access devices (CVADs) in children can result in complications such as infection, occlusion, and dislodgement. Purpose To evaluate whether reinforcing CVAD care bundles by using a regular direct feedback system could reduce such complications in children. Methods The intervention in this retrospective interrupted time-series study was initiated in January 2019. The study was divided into the preintervention (October–December 2018), 3-month postintervention (January–March 2019), and 6-month postintervention (April–June 2019) phases. Risk difference and Poisson regression analyses were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the intervention. Results The hospital-wide central line-related bloodstream infection rate decreased from 10.0/1,000 catheter-days to 4.5/1,000 catheter-days at 3-month postintervention (P=0.39) and to 1.4/1,000 catheter-days at 6-month postintervention (P=0.047). The central line occlusion rate significantly decreased from 30% to 12.8% (P=0.04) and 8.3% (P=0.002) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Approximately 7% of CVADs became dislodged during the preintervention phase versus 8.5% (P=0.364) and 3.3% (P=0.378) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Conclusion Reinforcing CVAD care bundles with direct feedback could significantly decrease CVAD-associated complications in terms of infection at 6-month postintervention, and occlusion at 3- and 6-month postintervention. Thus, reinforcement and regular direct feedback might improve care quality in children with CVADs.","","","","1223ddfa85a489cc101bac931092649cf20f494a","","","","","","Can central venous access device care bundles and regular feedback reduce central line-associated complications in pediatric patients?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1223ddfa85a489cc101bac931092649cf20f494a","","2020"

Vascular access is essential in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether critically ill children with obesity are more likely to undergo vascular device insertion (excluding peripheral IV catheters) and develop related complications. Design: Multi-institutional retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Ninety-four U.S. PICUs included in the Virtual Pediatric Systems, LLC database. Patients: 120,272 unique patients 2 to less than 18 years old admitted between January 2009 and December 2014. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients were categorized into normal weight, overweight, and obese (class 1, 2, or 3); underweight patients were excluded. We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression to test body mass index category as an independent predictor of vascular device placement and associated complications, adjusted for age, sex, severity of illness, primary diagnosis, presence of a complex chronic condition, and admission related to trauma or surgery. A total of 73,964 devices were placed in 45,409 patients (37.8% of the total cohort received a vascular device). Most device types placed differed significantly by weight status. Subjects with class 3 obesity were less likely (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81) to undergo placement of any device compared with normal weight patients. Patients with all classes of obesity were more likely to undergo placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter, with the strongest association in those with class 2 obesity (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14–1.40). Class 1 and class 3 obesity were independent risk factors for developing a complication, with odds ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.11–1.53) and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.07–1.99), respectively. Conclusions: Severe obesity is associated with decreased overall likelihood of placement of a vascular access device but increased likelihood of peripherally inserted central catheter placement and of device-related complications.","","","","050bba5a066bd9566d2068ef3ac54453967a241b","","","","","","Vascular Access in Critically Ill Pediatric Patients With Obesity*","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/050bba5a066bd9566d2068ef3ac54453967a241b","","2018"

Utilization remains variable between centers using ECMO as a rescue therapy or early protocolized extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: Single-center, retrospective evaluation of cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and rescue ECMO support from 2011 through 2019. Study objectives included survival, non-neurologic, and neurologic outcomes; validation of the SAVE and modified SAVE (mSAVE) scores for survival and favorable neurologic outcome; and predictive factor identification in cardiac arrest with ECMO rescue therapy. Results: Eighty-nine patients were included. In-hospital survival was 38.2% and median CPC score was 2. Survivors had lower BMI (27.9 ± 4.2 kg/m2 vs. 32.3 ± 7.5 kg/m2, P = 0.003), less obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) (26.5% vs. 49.1%, P = 0.035), shorter CPR duration (35.5 ± 31.7 m vs. 58.0 ± 49.5 m, P = 0.019), more tracheostomy (38.2% vs. 7.3%, P < 0.001), and less renal replacement therapy (RRT) (17.6% vs. 38.2%, P = 0.031). Patients with a favorable neurologic outcome had lower body weight (86.2 ± 17.9 kg vs. 98.1 ± 19.4 kg, P = 0.010), lower BMI (28.1 ± 4.5 kg/m2 vs. 33.9 ± 7.9 kg/m2, P < 0.001), and less obesity (29.7% vs. 56.3%, P = 0.026). mSAVE score predicted in-hospital survival (OR 1.11; 95%CI 1.03–1.19; P = 0.004) and favorable neurologic outcome (OR 1.11; 1.03–1.20; P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis for in-hospital survival included mSAVE, BMI, CPR-time, tracheostomy, and RRT (c-statistic: 0.864). Favorable neurologic outcome included mSAVE and BMI (c-statistic: 0.805). Conclusions: mSAVE, BMI, RRT, and tracheostomy are predictors of in-hospital survival and mSAVE and BMI are predictors of favorable neurologic outcome in cardiac arrest with ECMO rescue therapy.","","","","45546409c23e1b5a3c1ae99af9c97d345fbc34ca","","","","","","Survival and Outcomes After Cardiac Arrest With VA-ECMO Rescue Therapy","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45546409c23e1b5a3c1ae99af9c97d345fbc34ca","","2021"

Our objective was to provide an update on (1) challenges of obesity definition and classification in the perioperative setting, (2) challenges of perioperative patient positioning and vascular access, (3) perioperative implications of childhood obesity, (3) anesthetic medication dosing and opioid-sparing techniques in obese children, and (4) research gaps in perioperative childhood obesity research including a call to action. Recent findings Despite the near axiomatic observation that obesity is a pervasive clinical problem with considerable impact on perioperative health, there have only been a handful of research into the many ramifications of childhood obesity in the perioperative setting. A nuanced understanding of the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with obesity is essential to inform patients’ perioperative consultation and their parents’ counseling, improve preoperative risk mitigation, and improve patients’ rescue process when complications occur. Summary Anesthesiologists and surgeons will continue to be confronted with an unprecedented number of obese or overweight children with a high risk of perioperative complications.","","","","2cb88bef034d0f7d988f8b5b24b9776c74c7dab7","","","","","","Pediatric obesity and perioperative medicine","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cb88bef034d0f7d988f8b5b24b9776c74c7dab7","","2021"

Design: Hierarchical mixed effects analyses were used to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with AC or CVC placement. The ICU adjusted median odds ratios (ICU-AMOR) for the admission ICU, marginal R2, and conditional intraclass correlation coefficient were reported. Setting: 166 PICUs in the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS, LLC) Database. Patients: 682,791 patients with unscheduled admissions to the PICU. Intervention: None. Measures and Main Results: ACs were placed in (median, [interquartile range]) 8.2% [4.9%-11.3%] of admissions, and CVCs were placed in 14.9% [10.4%-19.3%] of admissions across cohort ICUs. Measured patient characteristics explained about 25% of the variability in AC and CVC placement. Higher Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) illness severity scores were associated with increased odds of placement (Odds Ratio (95th% Confidence Interval)) AC: 1.88 (1.87-1.89) and CVC: 1.82 (1.81-1.83) per 1 unit increase in PIM2 score. Primary diagnoses of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematology/oncology, infectious, renal/genitourinary, rheumatology, and transplant were associated with increased odds of AC or CVC placement compared to a primary respiratory diagnosis. Presence of in-house attendings 24/7 was associated with increased odds of AC placement 1.32 (1.11-1.57). Admission ICU explained 4.9% and 3.5% of the variability in AC or CVC placement, respectively. The ICU-AMOR showed a patient would have a median increase in odds of 55% and 43% for AC or CVC placement, respectively, if the same patient moved from an ICU with lower odds of placement to an ICU with higher odds of placement. Conclusions: Variation in AC or CVC use exists among PICUs. The admission ICU was more strongly associated with AC than with CVC placement. Further study is needed to understand unexplained variation in AC and CVC use.","","","","f5342c7ac2a7c6ce0e0a066bb568945a058e72ce","","","","","","Variation in Arterial and Central Venous Catheter Use in Pediatric Intensive Care Units","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5342c7ac2a7c6ce0e0a066bb568945a058e72ce","","2020"
"13",":Paper","CC-BY","Background: Achieving a reliable venous access in a particular subset of patients and/or in emergency settings can be challenging and time-consuming. Furthermore, many hospitalized patients do not meet the criteria for central venous catheter positioning, unless an upgrade of the treatment is further needed. The mini-midline catheter has already showed to be reliable and safe as a stand-alone device, since it is easily and rapidly inserted and can indwell up to 1 month. Methods: In this further case series, we retrospectively evaluated data from 63 patients where a previously inserted mini-midline catheter was upgraded to a central venous catheter (the devices inserted in the arm replaced by peripherally inserted central catheter and others inserted “off-label” in the internal jugular replaced by single lumen centrally inserted central catheter), being used as introducer for the Seldinger guidewire. Results: The guidewire replacement was been made even early (after 1 day) or late (more than 10 days), usually following a need for an upgrade in treatment. No early or late complications were reported. Conclusion: According to the preliminary data we collected, this converting procedure seems to be feasible and risk-free, since neither infectious nor thrombotic complications were reported.","","","","05f7c259a84218b2f114b6e0e783567f42d78e91","","","","","","Guide-wire replacement of a mini-midline catheter with a central venous catheter: A retrospective study on 63 cases","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05f7c259a84218b2f114b6e0e783567f42d78e91","","2020"

"18",":Paper","CC-BY","Background and Aims: Central venous cannulation is performed in children requiring vasopressor use, long-term antibiotics, chemotherapy or parenteral nutrition. The internal jugular vein is the preferred site for cannulation. Though, there are several studies describing the relation of the common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV) in the neck, there is a paucity of data regarding the anatomical relationship between the vertebral artery (VA) and the IJV. This study aims to describe the anatomical relationship between the IJV and the VA using ultrasound imaging in pre-school children in India. Material and Methods: Prospective observational cross-sectional study of 67 randomly selected children (age <5 years) who underwent an ultrasound examination of the right side of the neck, in a position mimicking central venous cannulation, to identify the relationship between the IJV and VA. The skin to the vertebral artery depth (D), width of the VA (W), distance between the IJV and the VA (DIV) was measured. Based on these, children were classified into high risk, moderate risk and low risk category for VA puncture. Results: Of the 67 children, 15 (22.4%) patients belonged to the high-risk group, 25 (37.3%) belonged to the moderate-risk group and 27 (40.23%) belonged to the low-risk group.

The present paper reports an unusual mechanical complication related to the use of a long term tunneled central venous catheter in a pediatric oncologic patient. An 18 months old child, diagnosed with stage M high-risk retroperitoneal neuroblastoma, underwent ultrasound-guided placement of a 6 Fr bilumen long-term tunneled central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein prior to the beginning of induction chemotherapy. The correct position of the distal tip of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopy. After 4 months of regular use of the device, the patient experienced neck swelling during high-dose chemotherapy infusion. A chest x-ray showed a dislocated catheter and bilateral pleural effusion. CT scan demonstrated the tip of the catheter rupturing the medial wall of the right jugular vein and entering the mediastinum; furthermore, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous neck emphysema and bilateral pleural effusion were noticed and a thrombus was evident in the right jugular vein at the insertion in the brachiocephalic vein. The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and bilateral thoracostomy tubes were placed urgently (500 mL of clear fluid were evacuated from pleural spaces). The dislocated catheter was removed electively on the following day under fluoroscopy. Despite ultrasound-guided placement and long-term uneventful use of the catheter, life-threatening central venous catheter-related mechanical complications can occur; the current case report emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of patients with central venous catheters in order to quickly diagnose and treat potentially lethal complications.","","","","798f1dafd5e47c606102d3bb4157e102495a9fb2","","","","","","Case report: Bilateral pleural effusion secondary to late migration of a tunneled central venous catheter in a patient affected by high risk neuroblastoma","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/798f1dafd5e47c606102d3bb4157e102495a9fb2","","2022"

Methods We prospectively monitored all patients who underwent central line insertion guided by ultrasound from March 2018 to March 2019. An independent nurse recorded the patient's age, gender, weight and BMI, diagnosis, indication for insertion, blood pressure state, insertion time, line size, number of pricks, and arterial punctures. Results A central line was inserted in 141 patients. The author applied the WIN technique in 16 patients, while in 125 patients, the central line was inserted via the traditional technique. The success rate was 100% for the WIN technique arm with zero arterial pricks, and the mean number of needle pricks was 1.1. For the traditional technique arm, the success rate was 90% with three arterial pricks. The mean number of needle pricks was 1.38.

CVC is an invasive procedure with possible mechanical, infectious, and thrombotic complications. The complete knotting of a catheter is a rare complication. The aim of this study is to report a case of a simple tight knot 2 cm from the catheter tip. We provide insights for early identification of catheter knotting, as well as its management. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a previous history of angioplasty and non-pharmacological coronary stent in a marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery evolved to junctional bradycardia and cardiogenic shock and was transferred to the reference hospital. He had a CVC inserted in the right jugular vein; however, it did not have any blood flow. The hypothesis of catheter knotting was suggested and confirmed through a chest X-ray. Venotomy was performed and it was successfully removed. Conclusions: Knotting in CVC obstruction is a rare complication. Recognition of this complication is essential to avoid major complications, such as catheter fragmentation and venous injury. Radiological follow-up after the procedure in patients with difficult anatomy is essential, and echo-guided catheterization should be encouraged when available. Despite the rarity of a knotted intravascular catheter, it is important to note this possible late complication that must be considered in the absence of catheter blood flow.","","","","850124023fef362b7ca6e4a3a0e18e5045676466","","","","","","Spontaneous Knot Formation in a Central Venous Catheter","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/850124023fef362b7ca6e4a3a0e18e5045676466","","2021"

"26",":Paper","CC-BY","Objective: We developed and validated a realistic simulation model for ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion in children that is easy to build and inexpensive and can automatically reproduce arterial and venous blood flow. Methods: The simulation model was constructed with a chicken breast, two DWP-385 water pumps, two types of tubes and a controller. An elastic rubber tourniquet and a silicone tube were connected to each water pump, which generated different continuous flows mimicking those of the pediatric internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, respectively. Both tubes were inserted into a piece of chicken breast and connected to the controller. Then, we provided a simulation program of ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion using our novel model to resident emergency medicine physicians. We also collected data on their knowledge and confidence levels regarding the procedure before and after the simulation via questionnaires utilizing a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The flow patterns of the artery and vein were well demonstrated with our model. A total of 11 resident physicians were enrolled. The knowledge and confidence regarding the discrimination of arteries and veins were significantly improved after training with our simulation model (p-value < 0.01). The subjective similarity and usefulness of our model also scored high on the questionnaire (median: 4; interquartile range in both categories: 4–5). Conclusion: Our novel simulation model is useful and realistic for ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion training. Clinical impact: This controlled motor system can be applied to many simulation models of artery and vein circulation.","","","","3d31f164d872d50b31b47a26ff388b2414802aec","","","","","","Novel Simulation Model That Realizes Arterial and Venous Blood Flow for Ultrasound-Guided Central Venous Catheter Insertion in Children","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d31f164d872d50b31b47a26ff388b2414802aec","","2021"

This study aimed to show that US-guided IJV catheterization can be successfully performed with local anesthesia and sedation in newborns. Methods: The files of newborn patients who underwent US-guided IJV catheterization between May 2017 and May 2020 were examined. Two groups were created according to the type of anesthesia applied during the procedure. The general characteristics of the newborns, the success of the procedure, the number of punctures, and the complication rates in both groups were compared. Results: A total of 53 newborns were included in this study. Of the 62 procedures, 30 were performed under general anesthesia (group A) and 32 were performed under sedation (group B). Twenty-six (86.6%) of the newborns in group A and 19 (59.3%) in group B were catheterized at the first puncture. The median puncture numbers in groups A and B were 1 (1-3) and 1 (1-5), respectively. All of the patients in group A were successfully catheterized (n = 30; 100%), and all but one in group B could be catheterized (n = 32; 96.8%). Conclusion: No significant differences in complications or procedural success rates were observed between newborns undergoing general anesthesia or sedation. US-guided IJV catheterization can be safely performed with sedation alone.","","","","b065cf6feab4172a6f2cf793462efffbb7841112","","","","","","Ultrasound-Guided Central Venous Access With Different Anesthesia Methods in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b065cf6feab4172a6f2cf793462efffbb7841112","","2021"

We retrospectively analyzed the Ports evaluation and flushing procedure data between February 3, 2020 and April 3, 2020; the cases were divided into the normal group and delayed group according to the critical point of the maintenance interval of 28 days (4 weeks). We compared the incidence of catheter obstruction between the 2 groups, analyzed the causes of catheter removal events in the 2 groups, and proposed corresponding protective treatment recommendations. During the period, 329 cases were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the incidence of catheter obstruction between the 2 groups. There were 15 patients with catheter removal, 8 cases of infection, 5 cases of catheter obstruction, and 1 case of an ectopic catheter, as well as 1 case of an overturned port. During the epidemic, no hospital infections related to the Ports flushing procedure occurred. The interval of Ports flushing procedures for patients without clinical symptoms can be appropriately extended during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, once the local infection symptoms or other sources of discomfort appear, Ports assessment needs to be performed as soon as possible. Take enhanced protected and isolation measures did not increase cross-infection during outpatient's flushing procedure at non-COVID-19-designated diagnosis and treatment hospitals.","","","","561acd218d8f24b859c5da014272e1aaacadd933","","","","","","Management of outpatient with totally implantable venous access Ports during the COVID-19 epidemic","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/561acd218d8f24b859c5da014272e1aaacadd933","","2021"

This study was performed to evaluate performance improvements and favorable attitudes through structured cardiac ultrasound program for emergency medicine residents. Methods Retrospective observational study using the point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) database in one tertiary academic-teaching hospital emergency department has been conducted. Cardiac ultrasound education and rotation program has been implemented in emergency medicine residency program. Structured evaluation sheet for cardiac ultrasound and questionnaire toward PoCUS have been developed. An early-phase and a late-phase case were selected randomly for each participant. Two emergency medicine specialists with expertise in PoCUS evaluated saved images independently. We used a paired t-test to compare the performance score of each phase and the results of the questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between the characteristics of participants and performance improvements. Results During the study period, a total of 1,652 bedside cardiac ultrasounds were administered. Forty-six examinations conducted by 23 emergency medicine residents were randomly selected for analysis. The performance score increased from 39.5 to 56.1 according to expert A and 45.3 to 62.9 according to expert B (p-value <0.01 for both). The average questionnaire score, which was analyzed for 17 participants, showed improvement from 18.9 to 20.7 (p-value <0.01). In multivariable linear regression analysis, younger age, higher early-phase score and higher confidence had a negative association with a greater improvement of performance, while the number of examinations had a positive association.

The treatment of pediatric onco-hematological diseases is complex and requires the use of integrated multimodal therapies. Long-lasting and safe central venous access is therefore a cornerstone for any successful treatment. Methods: The aim of this work is to define pediatric guidelines about the management of CVADs in onco-hematology. A panel of experts belonging to the working groups on Infections and Supportive Therapy, Surgery and Nursing of the Italian Pediatric Hematology Oncology Association (AIEOP) revised the scientific literature systematically, scored the level of evidence and prepared these guidelines. The content of the following guidelines was approved by the Scientific Board of AIEOP. Results and Conclusions: Important innovations have been developed recently in the field of CVADs, leading to new insertion methods, new materials and new strategy in the overall management of the device, especially in the adult population. These guidelines recommend how to apply these innovations in the pediatric population, and are directed to all physicians, nurses and health personnel active in the daily management of CVADs. Their aim is to update the knowledge on CVAD and improve the standard of care in pediatric patients with malignancies.","","","","22147e14d610ebbc6bfc5970eb60a28ea0737287","","","","","","Guidelines of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology for the management of the central venous access devices in pediatric patients with onco-hematological disease","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22147e14d610ebbc6bfc5970eb60a28ea0737287","","2020"

Methods: A cross-sectional survey study regarding the respondents’ demographic profiles, formal and informal training in USG-CVC placement, experiences, and attitudes towards the procedure was emailed to all EPs registered with the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) between October and December 2018. Results: In total, 234/350 SCFHS-registered EPs completed the survey; the response rate was 66.9%. Most respondents (70.5%) were board-certified in emergency medicine (EM). Ninety percent indicated that US device for CVC placement assistance was available. Most EPs (78.2%) had performed USG-CVC placement; the US usage rate correlated significantly with recent graduation from residency (p=0.048). In total, 83.3% received formal training during residency. Of the 234 respondents, 53.8% felt extremely comfortable with CVC placement with USG and 19.7% without USG (p<0.01). Nevertheless, most respondents desired further USG-CVC training. Conclusion: Despite existing evidence and a consensus on its superiority over the landmark technique, USG-CVC placement has not been adopted by a small proportion of EPs into clinical practice.

Vascular access device decision-making for pediatric patients remains a complex, highly variable process. To date, evidence-based criteria to inform these choices do not exist. The objective of the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters in pediatrics (miniMAGIC) was to provide guidance on device selection, device characteristics, and insertion technique for clinicians, balancing and contextualizing evidence with current practice through a multidisciplinary panel of experts.


METHODS
The RAND Corporation and University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method was used to develop miniMAGIC, which included the following sequential phases: definition of scope and key terms, information synthesis and literature review, expert multidisciplinary panel selection and engagement, case scenario development, and appropriateness ratings by an expert panel via 2 rounds.


RESULTS
The appropriateness of the selection, characteristics, and insertion technique of intravenous catheters commonly used in pediatric health care across age populations (neonates, infants, children, and adolescents), settings, diagnoses, clinical indications, insertion locations, and vessel visualization devices and techniques was defined. Core concepts including vessel preservation, insertion and postinsertion harm minimization (eg, infection, thrombosis), undisrupted treatment provision, and inclusion of patient preferences were emphasized.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we provide evidence-based criteria for intravenous catheter selection (from umbilical catheters to totally implanted venous devices) in pediatric patients across a range of clinical indications. miniMAGIC also highlights core vascular access practices in need of collaborative research and innovation.","","","","f9209bea7d5a291bc567461a6c02b332fe3d7dc9","","","","","","The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters in Pediatrics: miniMAGIC.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9209bea7d5a291bc567461a6c02b332fe3d7dc9","","2020"
"39",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","OBJECTIVE
To critically review the evidence for the selection and insertion of pediatric vascular access devices (VADs).


DATA SOURCES
Data were sourced from the US National Library of Medicine, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Cochrane Library databases, Embase, and international clinical trial databases.


STUDY SELECTION
Clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, cohort designs, randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi RCTs, before-after trials, or case-control studies that reported on complications and/or risk as well as reliability of VADs in patients aged 0 to 18 years were included.


DATA EXTRACTION
Articles were independently reviewed to extract and summarize details on the number of patients and catheters, population, age of participants, VAD type, study method, indication, comparators, and the frequency of VAD failure or complications.


RESULTS
VAD selection and insertion decision-making in general hospitalized and some specialized patient populations were well evidenced. The use of single-lumen devices and ultrasound-guided techniques was also broadly supported. There was a lack of RCTs, and for neonates, cardiac patients, patients with difficult venous access, midline catheters, catheter-to-vein ratio, and near-infrared devices, the lack of evidence necessitated broadening the review scope.


LIMITATIONS
Limitations include the lack of formal assessment of the quality of evidence and the lack of RCTs and systematic reviews. Consequently, clinical decision-making in certain pediatric populations is not guided by strong, evidence-based recommendations.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first synthesis of available evidence for the selection and insertion of VADs in pediatric patients and is important for determining the appropriateness of VADs in pediatric patients.","","","","06b7af34db6d66fc9c270c1f8b5af24ab90ab604","","","","","","Selection and Insertion of Vascular Access Devices in Pediatrics: A Systematic Review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06b7af34db6d66fc9c270c1f8b5af24ab90ab604","","2020"

Objectives: Current central venous catheter utilization in patients within pediatric cardiac ICUs is not well elucidated. We aim to describe current use of central venous catheters in a multi-institutional cohort and to explore the prevalence and risk factors for central line–associated thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infections. Design: Observational analysis. Setting: Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium hospitals. Patients: Hospitalizations with at least one cardiac ICU admission from October 2013 to July 2016. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: There were 17,846 hospitalizations and 69% included greater than or equal to one central venous catheter. Central venous catheter use was higher in younger patients (86% neonates). Surgical hospitalizations included at least one central venous catheter 88% of the time compared with 35% of medical hospitalizations. The most common location for central venous catheters was internal jugular (46%). Central venous catheters were in situ a median of 4 days (interquartile range, 2–10). There were 248 hospitalizations (2% overall, 1.8% medical, and 2.1% surgical) with at least one central line–associated thrombosis (271 total thromboses). Thrombosis was diagnosed at a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 4–14) after catheter insertion. There were 127 hospitalizations (1% overall, 1.4% medical, and 1% surgical) with at least one central line–associated bloodstream infection (136 total infections) with no association with catheter type or location. Central line–associated bloodstream infection was diagnosed at a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 8–36) after catheter insertion. Significant risk factors for central line–associated thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infection were younger age, greater surgical complexity, and total catheter days. Conclusions: Utilization of central venous catheters in pediatric cardiac ICUs differs according to indication for hospitalization. Although thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infection are infrequent complications of central venous catheter use in cardiac ICU patients, these events can have important short- and long-term consequences for patients. Total central venous catheter line days were the only modifiable risk factor identified. Future study must focus on understanding central venous catheter practices in high-risk patient subgroups that reduce the prevalence of thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infection.","","","","aed1f9470697d53abea681136e7e0c78867400c7","","","","","","Central Venous Catheter Utilization and Complications in the Pediatric Cardiac ICU: A Report From the Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium (PC4)*","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aed1f9470697d53abea681136e7e0c78867400c7","","2020"

First-tier practices for CLABSI prevention are well established. Objective: We describe second-tier prevention practices in Israeli medical-surgical ICUs and assess their association with CLABSI rates. Methods: In June 2017, an online survey assessing infection prevention practices in general ICUs was sent to all Israeli acute-care hospitals. The survey comprised 14 prevention measures supplementary to the established measures that are standard of care for CLABSI prevention. These measures fall into 2 domains: technology and implementation. The association between the number of prevention measures and CLABSI rate during the first 6 months of 2017 was assessed using Spearman’s correlation. We used negative binomial regression to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) associated with the overall number of prevention measures and with each measure individually. Results: The CLABSI rates in 24 general ICUs varied between 0.0 and 17.0 per 1,000 central-line days. Greater use of preventive measures was associated with lower CLABSI rates (ρ, –0.70; P < .001). For each additional measure, the incidence of CLABSI decreased by 19% (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.89). Specific measures associated with lower rates were involvement of ward champions (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31–0.71), auditing of insertions by infection control staff (IRR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19–0.64), and simulation-based training (IRR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.64). Conclusion: Implementation of second-tier preventive practices was protective against CLABSI. Use of more practices was correlated with lower rates.","","","","5edea6c89ea771bdfa3e982931c932d554e360e6","","","","","","The association between implementation of second-tier prevention practices and CLABSI incidence: A national survey","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5edea6c89ea771bdfa3e982931c932d554e360e6","","2019"

"49",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Introduction: Vascular access devices are commonly inserted devices that facilitate the administration of fluids and drugs, as well as blood sampling. Despite their common use in clinical settings, these devices are prone to occlusion and failure, requiring replacement and exposing the patient to ongoing discomfort/pain, local vessel inflammation and risk of infection. A range of insertion and maintenance strategies are employed to optimize device performance; however, the evidence base for many of these mechanisms is limited and the mechanisms contributing to the failure of these devices are largely unknown. Aims/objectives: (1) To revisit existing understanding of blood, vessel physiology and biological fluid dynamics; (2) develop an understanding of the implications that different clinical practices have on vessel health, and (3) apply these understandings to vascular access device research and practice. Method: Narrative review of biomedical and bioengineering studies related to vascular access practice. Results/outcomes: Current vascular access device insertion and maintenance practice and policy are variable with limited clinical evidence to support the theoretical assumptions underpinning these regimens. This review demonstrates the physiological response to vascular access device insertion, flushing and infusion on the vein, blood components and blood flow. These appear to be associated with changes in intravascular fluid dynamics. Variable forces are at play that impact blood componentry and the endothelium. These may explain the mechanisms contributing to vascular access failure. Conclusion: This review provides an update to our current knowledge and understanding of vascular physiology and the hemodynamic response, challenging some previously held assumptions regarding vascular access device maintenance, which require further investigation.","","","","ca1b6d7547ee5f1b9c63d6804aef0069cd7833ef","","","","","","Implications for maintaining vascular access device patency and performance: Application of science to practice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca1b6d7547ee5f1b9c63d6804aef0069cd7833ef","","2019"

This review highlights the current applications of POCUS for the critically ill child across PEM and PICU to identify areas of progress and standardized practice and to elucidate areas for future research. Recent findings POCUS technology continues to evolve and advance bedside clinical care for critically ill children, with ongoing research extending its use for an array of clinical scenarios, including respiratory distress, trauma and dehydration. Rapidly evolving and upcoming applications include diagnosis of pneumonia and acute chest syndrome, identification of intra-abdominal injury via contrast-enhancement, guidance of resuscitation, monitoring of increased intracranial pressure and procedural guidance. Summary POCUS is an effective and burgeoning method for both rapid diagnostics and guidance for interventions and procedures. It has clinical application for a variety of conditions that span PEM and PICU settings. Formal POCUS training is needed to standardize and expand use of this valuable technology by PICU and PEM providers alike.","","","","3cad0edc701d6e05b80980212caeeaa31c845097","","","","","","New directions in point-of-care ultrasound at the crossroads of paediatric emergency and critical care","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cad0edc701d6e05b80980212caeeaa31c845097","","2018"

It was a 58-month retrospective observational study. The setting was multivalent PICU with 20 beds at a tertiary children's hospital. The subjects were PICU residents undergoing training in central venous catheter placement. During the study period, 22 residents were enrolled in the study, and 1,157 catheter placement procedures (485 central venous, 605 peripherally inserted central venous, 57 hemodialysis, and 10 “other” types of catheter placement procedures) were analyzed. The total success rate was 82.7%. After ultrasound-guided training simulation in catheter placement, the residents' learning curve for the procedure rose from 71% in the clinical setting at the first trial to 75% at the fourth trial and 80% by the 24th trial. Significant positive correlation was found between procedure success and number of trials with a Spearman coefficient (p  <  0.019). Adequate clinical experiences were necessary for PICU residents to achieve competency in central venous catheter placement in critically ill children.","","","","e29dce4d78ffdfc8fc9b6ec750b095958f0d4cea","","","","","","The Effect of Clinical Experience on the Learning Curve of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Residents for the Central Venous Catheter Placement Procedure","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e29dce4d78ffdfc8fc9b6ec750b095958f0d4cea","","2017"

However device failure and complications rates are high. Over 2½ years, a child requiring parenteral nutrition and associated vascular access dependency due to ‘short gut syndrome’ (intestinal failure secondary to gastroschisis and resultant significant bowel resection) had ten CVADs inserted, with ninesubsequently failing. This resulted in multiple anaesthetics, invasive procedures, injuries, vascular depletion, interrupted nutrition, delayed treatment and substantial healthcare costs. A conservative estimate of the institutional costs for each insertion, or rewiring, of her tunnelled CVAD was $A10 253 (2016 Australian dollars). These complications and device failures had significant negative impact on the child and her family. Considering the commonality of conditions requiring prolonged vascular access, these failures also have a significant impact on international health service costs.","","","","612e0227ee2055f00669d34b764ddd31378d51e3","","","","","","Substantial harm associated with failure of chronic paediatric central venous access devices","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/612e0227ee2055f00669d34b764ddd31378d51e3","","2017"

Herein, we describe the multiple indications for CVC use and the different devices available for central venous access. Given the prevalent use of CVCs, healthcare systems are focused on reducing complications from their use, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). The most up-to-date information available sheds light on best practices and future areas of investigation. Recent findings Large systematic reviews of randomized trials suggest that ultrasound guidance for placement of CVCs in children is safer than using blind technique, at least for internal jugular vein access. Appropriate catheter tip placement is associated with decreased complications. Furthermore, the prophylactic use of ethanol lock between cycles of parenteral nutrition administration has reduced the rates of CLABSI. A recent randomized trial in pediatric CVCs showed a benefit with antibiotic-coated CVCs. Summary Based on the available evidence, multiple techniques for CVC placement are still valid, including the landmark technique based on practitioner experience, but ultrasound guidance has been shown to decrease complications from line placement. Adherence to CVC care protocols is essential in reducing infectious complications.","","","","e9861b3b22dcb529d2bbbeaf32619d0f1b8f65c9","","","","","","Central venous access in children: indications, devices, and risks","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9861b3b22dcb529d2bbbeaf32619d0f1b8f65c9","","2017"

"68",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Introduction One of the current challenges in long-term care homes (LTCH) is to identify the optimal model of care, which may include specialty physicians, nursing staff, person support workers, among others. There is currently no consensus on the complement or scope of care delivered by these providers, nor is there a repository of studies that evaluate the various models of care. We conducted a rapid scoping review to identify and map what care provider models and interventions in LTCH have been evaluated to improve quality of life, quality of care, and health outcomes of residents. Methods We conducted this review over 10-weeks of English language, peer-reviewed studies published from 2010 onward. Search strategies for databases (e.g., MEDLINE) were run on July 9, 2020. Studies that evaluated models of provider care (e.g., direct patient care), or interventions delivered to facility, staff, and residents of LTCH were included. Study selection was performed independently, in duplicate. Mapping was performed by two reviewers, and data were extracted by one reviewer, with partial verification by a second reviewer. Results A total of 7,574 citations were screened based on the title/abstract, 836 were reviewed at full text, and 366 studies were included. Studies were classified according to two main categories: healthcare service delivery (n = 92) and implementation strategies (n = 274). The condition/ focus of the intervention was used to further classify the interventions into subcategories. The complex nature of the interventions may have led to a study being classified in more than one category/subcategory. Conclusion Many healthcare service interventions have been evaluated in the literature in the last decade. Well represented interventions (e.g., dementia care, exercise/mobility, optimal/appropriate medication) may present opportunities for future systematic reviews. Areas with less research (e.g., hearing care, vision care, foot care) have the potential to have an impact on balance, falls, subsequent acute care hospitalization.","","","","a461a8e1e068022edb0db2c1b748125027d61a22","","","","","","Models of provider care in long-term care: A rapid scoping review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a461a8e1e068022edb0db2c1b748125027d61a22","","2021"

"73",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Abstract Objectives: Despite growing evidence that foot and ankle exercise programmes are effective for falls prevention, little is known about older adults’ views and preferences of programme components for long-term maintenance. The aims of this study were to explore the experiences and acceptability of Scottish and Portuguese older adults of undertaking a home-based foot, ankle and lower limb exercise intervention. Methods: Ten Scottish (mean age 76 years, 7 female) and fourteen Portuguese (mean age 66 years, 12 female) community-dwelling older adults undertook the programme for one week, followed by focus group discussions (2-6 people per group), guided by a semi-structured interview guide. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seven themes were identified:Assessment, Group exercise taster, Home based exercise; Footfall programme kit, Midweek phone call, Reasons for participation and the Research Process. Programme components, support telephone calls and research procedures were generally well accepted by participants and they valued having a contribution to the design. They preferred a blended home and intermittent group-based programme format for motivation and progression and recommended changes to some of the exercises and equipment to reduce barriers to participation. Some cultural differences emerged, including importance of the functional assessments for Portuguese participants, time issues and difficulty in completion of the exercise diary, reflecting lower literacy levels. Conclusions: Participants found the programme acceptable but preferred a blended home and occasional group-based programme for adherence and motivation. A strong educational component to improve health literacy and simple paperwork completion to avoid data loss in future studies with Portuguese older adults is important.","","","","4cf4fcdec4df0c978661385cde6f3fb3268014f1","","","","","","The Footfall Programme: participant experiences of a lower limb, foot and ankle exercise intervention for falls prevention - an exploratory study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4cf4fcdec4df0c978661385cde6f3fb3268014f1","","2019"

Setting Studies were not limited for inclusion based on setting. Participants Studies were included that featured older adults (>65 years of age). Interventions Studies were included that reported the development of a rehabilitation intervention. Primary and secondary outcome measures Data were extracted on study population, setting, type of intervention developed and frameworks used. The primary outcome of interest was the type of intervention development framework. Results Thirty-five studies were included. There was a range of underlying medical conditions including mild cognitive impairment and dementia (n=5), cardiac (n=4), stroke (n=3), falls (n=3), hip fracture (n=2), diabetes (n=2), breast cancer (n=1), Parkinson’s disease (n=1), depression (n=1), chronic health problems (n=1), osteoarthritis (n=1), leg ulcer (n=1), neck pain (n=1) and foot problems (n=1).

"76",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Abstract Background foot problems are independent risk factors for falls in older people. Podiatrists diagnose and treat a wide range of problems affecting the feet, ankles and lower limbs. However, the effectiveness of podiatry interventions to prevent falls in older people is unknown. This systematic review examined podiatry interventions for falls prevention delivered in the community and in care homes. Methods systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched multiple electronic databases with no language restrictions. Randomised or quasi-randomised-controlled trials documenting podiatry interventions in older people (aged 60+) were included. Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. TiDieR guidelines guided data extraction and where suitable statistical summary data were available, we combined the selected outcome data in pooled meta-analyses. Results from 35,857 titles and 5,201 screened abstracts, nine studies involving 6,502 participants (range 40–3,727) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were single component podiatry (two studies), multifaceted podiatry (three studies), or multifactorial involving other components and referral to podiatry component (four studies). Seven studies were conducted in the community and two in care homes. Quality assessment showed overall low risk for selection bias, but unclear or high risk of detection bias in 4/9 studies. Combining falls rate data showed significant effects for multifaceted podiatry interventions compared to usual care (falls rate ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.61, 0.99]); and multifactorial interventions including podiatry (falls rate ratio: 0.73 [95% CI 0.54, 0.98]). Single component podiatry interventions demonstrated no significant effects on falls rate. Conclusions multifaceted podiatry interventions and multifactorial interventions involving referral to podiatry produce significant reductions in falls rate. The effect of multi-component podiatry interventions and of podiatry within multifactorial interventions in care homes is unknown and requires further trial data.

Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (August 2017); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2017, Issue 8); and MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers to August 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing falls in older people in residential or nursing care facilities, or hospitals. Data collection and analysis One review author screened abstracts; two review authors screened full‐text articles for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We calculated rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for outcomes such as risk of falling (number of people falling). We pooled results where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. Main results Thirty‐five new trials (77,869 participants) were included in this update. Overall, we included 95 trials (138,164 participants), 71 (40,374 participants; mean age 84 years; 75% women) in care facilities and 24 (97,790 participants; mean age 78 years; 52% women) in hospitals. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low‐quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. Only the falls outcomes for the main comparisons are reported here. Care facilities Seventeen trials compared exercise with control (typically usual care alone). We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; 2002 participants, 10 studies; I² = 76%; very low‐quality evidence). Exercise may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 2090 participants, 10 studies; I² = 23%; low‐quality evidence). There is low‐quality evidence that general medication review (tested in 12 trials) may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.35; 2409 participants, 6 studies; I² = 93%) or the risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09; 5139 participants, 6 studies; I² = 48%). There is moderate‐quality evidence that vitamin D supplementation (4512 participants, 4 studies) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; I² = 62%), but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; I² = 42%). The population included in these studies had low vitamin D levels. Multifactorial interventions were tested in 13 trials. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (RaR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18; 3439 participants, 10 studies; I² = 84%; very low‐quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; 3153 participants, 9 studies; I² = 42%; low‐quality evidence). Hospitals Three trials tested the effect of additional physiotherapy (supervised exercises) in rehabilitation wards (subacute setting). The very low‐quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls (RaR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.34; 215 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%), or whether it reduces the risk of falling (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93; 83 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%). We are uncertain of the effects of bed and chair sensor alarms in hospitals, tested in two trials (28,649 participants) on rate of falls (RaR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) or risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.24; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Multifactorial interventions in hospitals may reduce rate of falls in hospitals (RaR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 44,664 participants, 5 studies; I² = 52%). A subgroup analysis by setting suggests the reduction may be more likely in a subacute setting (RaR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; 3747 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the risk of falling (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 39,889 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions In care facilities: we are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but not risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls; they may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. In hospitals: we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls or whether it reduces the risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of providing bed sensor alarms on the rate of falls or risk of falling. Multifactorial interventions may reduce rate of falls, although subgroup analysis suggests this may apply mostly to a subacute setting; we are uncertain of the effect of these interventions on risk of falling.","","","","b4cae810ce4c8c934b4b50dd4d70d002a897a839","","","","","","Interventions for preventing falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4cae810ce4c8c934b4b50dd4d70d002a897a839","","2018"

"83",":Paper","CC-BY","Background Flexible pes planus (flat feet) in children is a common reason parents and caregivers seek health professionals consult and a frequent reason podiatrists prescribe foot orthoses. Yet no universal agreement exists on the diagnosis of this condition, or when and how foot orthoses should be prescribed. The aim of this study was to garner consensus and agreement among podiatrists on the use of FOs for paediatric flexible pes planus. Methods A three round Delphi consensus survey was undertaken with 15 podiatry experts from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Round One gathered consensus on the diagnosis and intervention into paediatric pes planus with specific questions on types of FOs and prescription variables used. Round Two and Three were based on answers from Round One and gathered agreement (rationale for choices) on a five point Likert scale. 70% of respondents had to agree to a statement for it to be accepted as consensus or agreement. Results Consensus and agreement was achieved for 83 statements directing the diagnosis of pes planus (using FPI-6 and/or rearfoot measures), common signs and symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, abnormal gait and other functional concerns) that direct when to intervene into paediatric flexible pes planus. Prefabricated orthoses were the preferred intervention where adequate control is gained with their use. When customised orthoses are prescribed, a vertical [heel] cast pour (71.4%) and minimal arch fill (76.9%) are the prescription variables of choice, plus or minus additional variables (i.e., medial heel (Kirby) skive, the use of a University of California Biomechanical Laboratory device or a medial flange) dependent on level of disorder and plane of excessive motion. Conclusions This study identified consensus and agreement on a series of diagnosis methods and interventions for the paediatric flexible pes planus. A clinical protocol was developed from the resultant consensus statements which provides clinicians with a series of evidenced-informed statements to better guide them on when, how and why FOs are used specific to this population.","","","","0418178a8dcd8489ba85909c86f82886f2b2d65a","","","","","","When, why and how foot orthoses (FOs) should be prescribed for children with flexible pes planus: a Delphi survey of podiatrists","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0418178a8dcd8489ba85909c86f82886f2b2d65a","","2018"
"84",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Background The path to recovery of muscle strength and mobility following discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) has not been well described. Objective The study objective was to quantify muscle function, gait, and postural control at 3 and 6 months after discharge in people who were recovering from critical illness and who were ventilated for 7 days or more. Design This was a nested longitudinal study with continuous inclusion of individuals over a 2‐year period and with age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Methods Twenty‐four people were tested at 3 months after ICU discharge; 16 of them (67%) were reevaluated at 6 months (post‐ICU group). Healthy controls (n = 12) were tested at a single time point. Muscle function of the knee extensors (KEs), plantar flexors (PFs), and dorsiflexors (DFs) was assessed on a dynamometer. Gait was measured using an electronic walkway, and postural control was measured with 2 portable force plates. Results Muscle weakness was observed across all muscle groups at 3 months, with the greatest strength reductions in the ankle PFs (45%) and DFs (30%). Muscle power was reduced in the PFs and DFs but was not reduced in the KEs. Gait in the post‐ICU group was characterized by a narrower step, longer stride, and longer double‐support time than in the controls. Improvements were found in KE strength and in stride time and double‐support time during gait at 6 months. Leg muscle strength and power had moderate associations with gait velocity, step width, and stride length (r = .44‐.65). Limitations The small heterogeneous sample of people with a high level of function was a limitation of this study. Conclusions Muscle strength and power were impaired at 6 months after ICU discharge and were associated with gait parameters. Future studies are needed to examine the role of muscle strength and power training in post‐ICU rehabilitation programs to improve mobility.","","","","f796592ed85719db170f4e91c311982eff681447","","","","","","Quantitative Evaluation of Muscle Function, Gait, and Postural Control in People Experiencing Critical Illness After Discharge From the Intensive Care Unit","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f796592ed85719db170f4e91c311982eff681447","","2018"

"90",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Abstract Background The Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP) program has delivered a specialty-team based first-episode service (FES) since 2006 in New Haven. In 2015, STEP launched a 4-year early detection (ED) campaign (Mindmap), adapted from the Scandinavian TIPS approach, to shorten Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) in a 10-town catchment (popn. 400,000). Methods Mindmap’s social-ecological model targeted demand (delays in identifying illness and help-seeking) and supply (delays in referring to and providing FES) side constituents of DUP. Mindmap used mass and social media messaging, professional detailing, and rapid triage of referrals. DUP was measured as the time between the onset of psychosis and initiation of antipsychotic treatment (DUP1) and FES care (DUP2). A control FES (PREP, Boston) supported the quasi-experimental design. Quantile regression was used to interrogate the impact of the campaign across the full range of DUP. The campaign was launched in 2015, after a one-year baseline. Results The third quartile of DUP1 fell significantly at the intervention site in the pre- vs. post-campaign period (329 to 185 days, p=0.03). A time-series analysis revealed a cumulative effect of the campaign over time i.e. for each year of campaigning a 46-day reduction was achieved at STEP. DUP1 at the other quartiles and DUP2 across all quartiles showed a consistent trend of reduction over time at STEP, but this did not reach conventional statistical significance. At PREP both DUP1 & DUP2 remain unchanged, and comparable to baseline levels at STEP. Discussion Mindmap has shown promise in reducing delays to care and this is the first controlled demonstration of DUP reduction in a U.S. community setting. Additional data on help-seeking events and pathways to care and social media metrics will be presented as mediating variables. Mindmap was an early detection campaign hosted by an established FES and targeting a defined geographic catchment to recruit all incident cases. As such, this effort included a wide range of community and clinical stakeholders and modeled a population health based approach to the care of early psychosis. The lessons are relevant for burgeoning FES implementations across the world, and these will be elaborated based on the data and experience of implementing this study.","","","","a9c07a407dee227f21f16bbbeb1930a04ebac14b","","","","","","O1.2.

"94",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","BACKGROUND
In this article, the authors examine prescription weight-loss medications and related dental considerations for oral health care professionals (OHCPs). The authors focus on the most common prescription weight-loss drugs and their potential interactions with medications frequently used in dental practice, and they include recommendations for modification in patient care.


METHODS
The authors reviewed the literature regarding interactions between weight-loss drugs and medications commonly used in dentistry, including patient-treatment considerations. They also address the interactions of greatest clinical concern that have a high-quality evidence-based foundation in either randomized controlled clinical trials or meta-analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
Dental treatment can be performed and medications commonly used in dentistry can be administered safely to patients taking orlistat, an inhibitor of fat absorption. The same may not be true, however, for other weight-loss medications that modify the central nervous system neurotransmission of norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin. OHCPs should be aware of the potential theoretical and pharmacokinetic risks relative to the actual clinical and reported risks for hypertension and cardiotoxicity in particular.


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Recognition and avoidance of potential weight-loss drug interactions, especially those with medications commonly used in dentistry, can help clinicians optimize patient treatment while emphasizing patient safety.","","","","a9b61a61a603fb3b12937d53034ed1772bb19a71","","","","","","Dental considerations for patients taking weight-loss medications.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9b61a61a603fb3b12937d53034ed1772bb19a71","","2014"

"96",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Adverse events pose a serious problem for quality of healthcare. Dental practice is eminently invasive and involves close and routine contact with secretions; as such, it is potentially prone to the occurrence of adverse events. Various patient safety studies have been developed in the last two decades, but mostly in the hospital setting due to the organizational complexity, severity of the cases, and diversity and specificity of the procedures. The objective was to identify and explore studies on patient safety in Dentistry. An integrative literature review was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus via Portal Capes, and the Regional Portal of the Virtual Health Library, using the terms patient safety and dentistry in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, starting in 2000. The research cycle in patient safety was used, as proposed by the World Health Organization to classify studies. We analyzed 91 articles. The most common adverse events were allergies, infections, diagnostic delay or failure, and technical error. Measures to mitigate the problem highlight the need to improve communications, encourage reporting, and search for tools to assist the management of care. The authors found a lack of studies on implementation and assessment of the impact of proposals for improvement. Dentistry has made progress in patient safety but still needs to transpose the results into practice, where efforts are crucial to prevent adverse events.","","","","0b7bcd288305e8537a27b8daadb741a501218417","","","","","","Patient safety in dental care: an integrative review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b7bcd288305e8537a27b8daadb741a501218417","","2020"

"98",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","An accurate medication history allows the oral health care provider (OHCP) to evaluate a patient's overall health and disease status, as well as assess the effect medications may have on dental treatment and oral health. It has been previously documented that dental patients do not always report an accurate medication list. The aims of this study were to determine dental patients' perceptions regarding the importance and likelihood of accurately disclosing prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), and herbal/supplement medications to their OHCP. A voluntary patient survey was administered from October 2015 through March 2016 to new dental patients at the Creighton University School of Dentistry student-operated clinic. Of 300 surveys distributed, 217 were found to be complete for inclusion in the evaluation (response rate 72.3%). Of the responding patients, 75.6%, 69.1%, and 63.6% reported believing it was very important to inform their dentists of their prescribed, OTC, and herbal/supplement medications, respectively. Additionally, 80.7%, 71.4%, and 62.7% reported that they always informed their dentists of all their prescribed, OTC, and herbal/supplement medications, respectively. Although the majority of these patients agreed on the importance of reporting medication information to their OHCP and reported doing so, this survey found room for improvement, especially regarding OTC and herbal/supplement medications. It is imperative that both the pharmacist and OHCP educate dental and pharmacy students to inform patients of the importance of providing an accurate and complete medication history to ensure the safest possible delivery of their dental treatment.","","","","d5800c5adda8b9fa8590576a6ee9a993a9baeca2","","","","","","A Survey of Dental Patient Attitudes on the Likelihood and Perceived Importance of Disclosing Daily Medications.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5800c5adda8b9fa8590576a6ee9a993a9baeca2","","2018"

This study aimed to evaluate the registered dentist program through the sealant utilization rate using national cohort data and to compare the socioeconomic gap of the cohorts by participation. The sample cohort data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Sharing Service (NHISS) in South Korea. The utilization of dental sealants was analyzed using the chi-square test according to the independent variables of each year. To identify the independent effects of participation in the registered dentists’ program, a panel logistic regression analysis of the utilization of dental sealants was performed. The participants were 1.35 times more likely to have dental sealants than non-participants. The significance of income quintiles disappeared in the case groups. The gap became more obvious in the employees of the control group even after adjusting for all variables.

"106",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Objectives To understand the extent to which behaviors consistent with high quality medication reconciliation occurred in primary care settings and explore barriers to high quality medication reconciliation. Design Fully mixed sequential equal status design including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Setting Primary care practices within an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. Participants We conducted 170 observations of patient encounters across 15 primary care clinics, 48 semi-structured interviews with staff, and 10 semi-structured interviews with patients. We also sent out surveys to 2,541 eligible staff with 616 responses (24% response rate) and to 5,132 eligible patients with 577 responses (11% response rate). Results Inconsistency emerged as a major barrier to effective medication reconciliation. This inconsistency was present across a variety of factors such as the lack of standardized workflows for conducting medication reconciliation, a lack of knowledge about medication and the process of medication reconciliation, varying levels of importance ascribed to medication reconciliation, and inadequate integration of medication reconciliation into clinical workflows. Findings were generally consistent across all data collection methods. Conclusion We have identified several barriers which impact the process of medication reconciliation in primary care settings. Our key finding is that the process of medication reconciliation is plagued by inconsistencies which contribute to inaccurate medication lists. These inconsistencies can be broken down into several categories (standardization, knowledge, importance, and inadequate integration) which can be targets for future studies and interventions.","","","","6263e5e8247287a18b7d2b7e298c872f477b76ee","","","","","","A mixed methods evaluation of medication reconciliation in the primary care setting","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6263e5e8247287a18b7d2b7e298c872f477b76ee","","2021"

The endometriosis fertility index was developed to predict the fertility outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for endometriosis. Finally, the American Association of Gynecological Laparoscopists classification is currently being developed, for which 30 endometriosis experts are analyzing and researching data by assigning scores to categories considered important; however, it has not yet been fully validated and published. Currently, none of the classification systems are considered the gold standard. In this article, we review the classification systems, identify their pros and cons, and discuss what improvements need to be made to each system in the future.","","","","f4912163fa7cd3e65310b7cd31e8827f4ee598e1","","","","","","Classification of endometriosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4912163fa7cd3e65310b7cd31e8827f4ee598e1","","2020"
"109",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lactoferrin and iron and its binding proteins in women with endometriosis by simultaneously measuring these parameters in plasma and peritoneal fluid. Ninety women were evaluated, of whom 57 were confirmed as having endometriosis. Lactoferrin was measured by ELISA, transferrin, ferritin and iron on a Cobas 8000 analyser. Lactoferrin and transferrin in peritoneal fluid were lower compared to plasma, in contrast to ferritin and iron. In plasma, lactoferrin showeds associations with iron and transferrin in endometriosis and with ferritin in the group without endometriosis. Lactoferrin in peritoneal fluid correlated with lactoferrin, iron and transferrin of plasma in patients without endometriosis. The ratio of lactoferrin concentration in peritoneal fluid to plasma differentiated stage I versus IV of endometriosis and was negatively correlated with the iron ratio in patients without endometriosis. The ferritin ratio differentiated women with and without endometriosis. The very high ferritin ratios, especially in advanced stages of endometriosis, suggest the protective involvement of this protein in peritoneal fluid and the loss of this role by lactoferrin. The results demonstrate the validity of assessing iron metabolism in women with endometriosis, which may be useful as a marker of the disease and its progression.","","","","2011a3bad0cfc0fd0f140a1aea04e5c28d74142f","","","","","","The Influence of Lactoferrin in Plasma and Peritoneal Fluid on Iron Metabolism in Women with Endometriosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2011a3bad0cfc0fd0f140a1aea04e5c28d74142f","","2023"

Therefore, it is imperative to identify reliable, non-invasive biomarkers of the disease. The aim of this study was to analyse the concentrations of fibronectin and type IV collagen in peritoneal fluid and plasma to assess their role as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of endometriosis. Fibronectin and collagen IV protein levels were assessed by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) biosensors with the usage of monoclonal antibodies. All patients enrolled in the study were referred for laparoscopy for the diagnosis of infertility or chronic pelvic pain (n = 84). The study group included patients with endometriosis confirmed during surgery (n = 49). The concentration of fibronectin in the plasma (329.3 ± 98.5 mg/L) and peritoneal fluid (26.8 ± 11.1 μg/L) in women with endometriosis was significantly higher than in the control group (251.2 ± 84.0 mg/L, 7.0 ± 5.9 μg/L). Fibronectin levels were independent of endometriosis stage (p = 0.874, p = 0.469). No significant differences were observed in collagen IV levels (p = 0.385, p = 0.465). The presence of elevated levels of fibronectin may indicate abnormalities in cell–ECM signalling during the course of endometriosis, and may be a potential biomarker for early detection.","","","","f99bf3982b950ec7b868ad9e06596c98e5e91f63","","","","","","Plasma and Peritoneal Fluid Fibronectin and Collagen IV Levels as Potential Biomarkers of Endometriosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f99bf3982b950ec7b868ad9e06596c98e5e91f63","","2022"

Symptoms of severe pelvic pain, infertility, fatigue, and abnormal menstruation can cause significant negative effects on an individual’s physical and mental health, including interactions with their family, friends, and health care providers. Stigma associated with endometriosis has been under-studied and is rarely discussed in current literature. Herein, this paper aims to provide a brief overview of published literature to explore and establish the plausibility of stigma as a driver of suboptimal psychosocial well-being and diagnostic delay among individuals living with endometriosis. We present the clinical characteristics and physical and mental health consequences associated with endometriosis, highlight several theoretical constructs of stigma, and review the limited studies documenting women’s lived experiences of endometriosis-related stigma. To mitigate harmful effects of this phenomenon, we recommend increasing efforts to assess the prevalence of and to characterize endometriosis-related stigma, implementing awareness campaigns, and developing interventions that combat the multidimensional negative effects of stigma on timely care, treatment, and quality of life for individuals living with endometriosis.","","","","b551920df05508941de5f3ef6097484b91fc9e3f","","","","","","Stigma and Endometriosis: A Brief Overview and Recommendations to Improve Psychosocial Well-Being and Diagnostic Delay","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b551920df05508941de5f3ef6097484b91fc9e3f","","2021"

The lack of pharmacological treatments suitable for the long-term relief of endometriosis-associated pain, without an impact on fertility, remains an urgent unmet need. Progress has been slowed by the absence of a reproducible rodent endometriosis model that fully replicates human physiopathological characteristics, including pain symptoms. Although pain assessment in rodents is a complicated task requiring qualified researchers, the choice of the behavioral test is no less important, since selecting inappropriate tests can cause erroneous data. Pain is usually measured with reflex tests in which hypersensitivity is evaluated by applying a noxious stimulus, yet this ignores the associated emotional component that could be evaluated via non-reflex tests. We conducted a systematic review of endometriosis models used in rodents and the number of them that studied pain. The type of behavioral test used was also analyzed and classified according to reflex and non-reflex tests. Finally, we determined the most used reflex tests for the study of endometriosis-induced pain and the main non-reflex behavioral tests utilized in visceral pain that can be extrapolated to the study of endometriosis and complement traditional reflex tests.","","","","d3568ec173b121e2df3efc26f6382ef95d2f1829","","","","","","Rodent Animal Models of Endometriosis-Associated Pain: Unmet Needs and Resources Available for Improving Translational Research in Endometriosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3568ec173b121e2df3efc26f6382ef95d2f1829","","2023"

It has been reported that dehydrocorydaline (DHC) can inhibit monoamine transporter uptake in depressed CUMS mice, but more possible mechanisms of action remain to be further studied. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for five consecutive weeks. The mice were administrated with dehydrocorydaline or fluoxetine (FLU) for four consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were applied. In parallel, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining were used to explore the effect of DHC on pathological changes in the hippocampus. The concentrations of depression-related factors (5-HT and DA) and inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in the hippocampus and serum were assessed by ELISA assay. NLRP3 inflammasome pathway-related proteins (NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1 IL-1α, and caspase-1) were detected by western blot. The activation of microglia and astrocytes was subjected to immunofluorescent staining. Additionally, microglia were treated with DHC (100 mg/L) for 24 h following incubation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 12 h. ov-NC or ov-NLRP3 plasmid was transfected into microglia 6 h before LPS induction for exploring the effect of NLRP3 overexpression on DHC-inhibited microglia activation. Then, conditioned media of microglia were collected from each group, followed by intervention of astrocytes for 24 h to explore the effect of NLRP3 overexpression of microglia on astrocyte activation. Results: In vivo administration of DHC was found to ameliorate depressive-like behaviors and attenuate neuron damage of CUMS mice. DHC increased neurotransmitter concentration, reduced the proinflammatory factor levels, attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and decreased A1 astrocyte and microglia activation in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Furthermore, in vivo results showed that activated microglia induced activation of A1 astrocytes but not A2 astrocytes. Conclusion: Taken together, we provided evidence that DHC exhibited antidepressive effects on CUMS mice possibly via NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated astrocyte activation.","","","","15d7263b82db617d12b2f09254ab3c3eaba021ae","","","","","","The role and mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated astrocyte activation in dehydrocorydaline against CUMS-induced depression","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15d7263b82db617d12b2f09254ab3c3eaba021ae","","2022"

It is shown that the cable with corrugated sheath has higher damping effect for the overvoltage. Furthermore, material and shape of the corrugated sheath will be adjusted to investigate their influence on cable's transmission line parameters.","","","","b7d2e37785c01b4a4409c329d2a18a1277968304","","","","","","Effect of Power Cable Corrugated Sheath on Overvoltage","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7d2e37785c01b4a4409c329d2a18a1277968304","","2020"

"141",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Elucidating the underlying genetic drivers of production traits in agricultural and aquaculture species is critical to efforts to maximize farming efficiency. “Omics” based methods (i.e., transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are increasingly being applied to gain unprecedented insight into the biology of many aquaculture species. While the culture of penaeid shrimp has increased markedly, the industry continues to be impeded in many regards by disease, reproductive dysfunction, and a poor understanding of production traits. Extensive effort has been, and continues to be, applied to develop critical genomic resources for many commercially important penaeids. However, the industry application of these genomic resources, and the translation of the knowledge derived from “omics” studies has not yet been completely realized. Integration between the multiple “omics” resources now available (i.e., genome assemblies, transcriptomes, linkage maps, optical maps, and proteomes) will prove critical to unlocking the full utility of these otherwise independently developed and isolated resources. Furthermore, emerging “omics” based techniques are now available to address longstanding issues with completing keystone genome assemblies (e.g., through long-read sequencing), and can provide cost-effective industrial scale genotyping tools (e.g., through low density SNP chips and genotype-by-sequencing) to undertake advanced selective breeding programs (i.e., genomic selection) and powerful genome-wide association studies. In particular, this review highlights the status, utility and suggested path forward for continued development, and improved use of “omics” resources in penaeid aquaculture.","","","","86a805a0304aef0193924d9cb970bcc69c7a8275","","","","","","The State of “Omics” Research for Farmed Penaeids: Advances in Research and Impediments to Industry Utilization","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86a805a0304aef0193924d9cb970bcc69c7a8275","","2018"

"145",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","SUMMARY Exposure of prawns to dark- or light-coloured substrates is known to trigger a strong colour adaptation response through expansion or contraction of the colouration structures in the prawn hypodermis. Despite the difference in colour triggered by this adaptive response, total levels of the predominant carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin, are not modified, suggesting that another mechanism is regulating this phenomenon. Astaxanthin binds to a specific protein called crustacyanin (CRCN), and it is the interaction between the quantities of each of these compounds that produces the diverse range of colours seen in crustacean shells. In this study, we investigated the protein changes and genetic regulatory processes that occur in prawn hypodermal tissues during adaptation to black or white substrates. The amount of free astaxanthin was higher in animals adapted to dark substrate compared with those adapted to light substrate, and this difference was matched by a strong elevation of CRCN protein. However, there was no difference in the expression of CRCN genes either across the moult cycle or in response to background substrate colour. These results indicate that exposure to a dark-coloured substrate causes an accumulation of CRCN protein, bound with free astaxanthin, in the prawn hypodermis without modification of CRCN gene expression. On light-coloured substrates, levels of CRCN protein in the hypodermis are reduced, but the carotenoid is retained, undispersed in the hypodermal tissue, in an esterified form. Therefore, the abundance of CRCN protein affects the distribution of pigment in prawn hypodermal tissues, and is a crucial regulator of the colour adaptation response in prawns.","","","","979d8ef33411e211be4bb969f3214f99f6b71987","","","","","","Mechanisms of colour adaptation in the prawn Penaeus monodon","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/979d8ef33411e211be4bb969f3214f99f6b71987","","2012"
"146",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is critical in the development and regulation of reproduction in fish. The inhibition of neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression may diminish or severely hamper gonadal development due to it being the key regulator of the axis, and then provide a model for the comprehensive study of the expression patterns of genes with respect to the fish reproductive system. Methodology/Principal Findings In a previous study we injected 342 fertilized eggs from the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with a gene construct that expressed antisense sGnRH. Four years later, we found a total of 38 transgenic fish with abnormal or missing gonads. From this group we selected the 12 sterile females with abnormal ovaries in which we combined suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray analysis to define changes in gene expression of the HPG axis in the present study. As a result, nine, 28, and 212 genes were separately identified as being differentially expressed in hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary, of which 87 genes were novel. The number of down- and up-regulated genes was five and four (hypothalamus), 16 and 12 (pituitary), 119 and 93 (ovary), respectively. Functional analyses showed that these genes involved in several biological processes, such as biosynthesis, organogenesis, metabolism pathways, immune systems, transport links, and apoptosis. Within these categories, significant genes for neuropeptides, gonadotropins, metabolic, oogenesis and inflammatory factors were identified. Conclusions/Significance This study indicated the progressive scaling-up effect of hypothalamic sGnRH antisense on the pituitary and ovary receptors of female carp and provided comprehensive data with respect to global changes in gene expression throughout the HPG signaling pathway, contributing towards improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and regulative pathways in the reproductive system of teleost fish.","","","","477d6a84eda0560d10c2d63238390d9c9dcd6ec8","","","","","","Defining Global Gene Expression Changes of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis in Female sGnRH-Antisense Transgenic Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/477d6a84eda0560d10c2d63238390d9c9dcd6ec8","","2011"

Various protocols are available which use replication at the middleware but this raises problems in multi-operating dependence environment. Replication of object at the server side ensures the consistency of objects. Some problems of sequential paradigm of consistency are also addressed in this paper.

This is the minimization of a nonconvex objective function subject to mixed integer constraints. The existing numerical algorithms could rarely address to its solutions through computationally affordable procedures. Even the conventional relaxation of the integer constraints by linear constraints does not lead to convex optimization, so the standard convexification does not work either.

To accommodate this joint consideration, each chromosome in the proposed GA is divided into an integer string for relay selection, and two real number strings for bandwidth allocation and power distribution. In addition, new crossover and mutation operations are employed for this new type of chromosomes. To alleviate the complexity overhead, a low-complexity two-stage implementation is also addressed. Conducted simulations show that both of the proposed GA and the two-stage implementation can attain close performance as the upper bound and outperform some representative previous works. The two-stage implementation is in particular appealing by exhibiting negligible performance degradation with reduced computations.","","","","887c25cbb67e83aefcac895a449b6b5e96e4577b","","","","","","Joint resource allocation and relay selection via genetic algorithm in multi-user decode-and-forward cooperative systems","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/887c25cbb67e83aefcac895a449b6b5e96e4577b","","2014"
"151",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","In cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs), there has been growing demand of transmitting secondary user (SU) source information secretly to the corresponding SU destination with the aid of cooperative SU relays. Efficient power allocation (PA) among SU relays and multi-relay selection (MRS) are a critical problem for operating such networks whereas the interference to the primary user receiver is being kept below a tolerable level and the transmission power requirements of the secondary users are being satisfied. Subsequently, in the paper, we develop the problem to solve the optimal solution for PA and MRS in a collaborative amplify-and-forward-based CCRNs, in terms of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) of the networks. It is found that the problem is a mixed integer programming problem and difficult to be solved. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a meta-heuristic genetic algorithm-based MRS and PA scheme to maximize the SR of the networks while satisfying transmission power and the interference requirements of the networks. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal SR performance, compared to the exhaustive search scheme, and provides a significant SR improvement when compared with some conventional relay selection schemes with equal power allocation.","","","","ca795342058fb17514171bc6ffdb6ceff42bac65","","","","","","Joint Relay Selection and Power Allocation through a Genetic Algorithm for Secure Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca795342058fb17514171bc6ffdb6ceff42bac65","","2018"

"154",":Paper","CC-BY","Node cooperation approaches improve physical layer security in wireless networks without applying data encryption. Selecting the appropriate nodes to cooperate as relays or friendly jammers, to degrade eavesdropper's link, is a challenging problem which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Various approaches, based on conventional exhaustive search, have been suggested for optimal relay-jammer selection and power allocation in the literature. The complexity of these methods is proportional to the number of intermediate nodes. As the number of intermediate nodes exceeds a specific bound, conventional exhaustive search appears infeasible due to high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on genetic algorithm (GA), for relay-jammer selection, power allocation and computational complexity reduction. Our system model consists of a source-destination pair, one eavesdropper and a number of intermediate nodes which cooperate as relays or friendly jammers. Considering the achievable secrecy rate as the cost function for GA optimization, the proposed algorithm is performed in two steps. First, we determine the desired channel gains that maximize the secrecy rate using GA. In the second step, nodes for which the corresponding channel gains have the smallest deviation from the obtained values in the first step, will be chosen as relays or jammers. We compare the proposed method with two kinds of conventional exhaustive search techniques one with fixed and the other with adaptive power allocated to jammers. Simulation results show that the proposed method reduces computational complexity while attaining a secrecy rate close to conventional techniques. Also the power which is allocated to jammers during each phase of transmission will be declined using GA optimization. Despite of conventional exhaustive search, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is almost the same as the number of cooperative nodes increases. So, the proposed method will outperform the previous works in terms of simplicity, efficiency and security.","","","","4f45fb6e721d06dc0903e543b705a366c955c232","","","","","","A genetic approach in relay-jammer selection and power allocation for physical layer security","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f45fb6e721d06dc0903e543b705a366c955c232","","2016"

One way to measure memory disturbances and their functional implications is via a memory questionnaire. Several pediatric memory questionnaires have been published but no systematic review has been conducted to establish their psychometric properties.

A systematic search of CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsychINFO was completed on June 2019. The selection process was guided by pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by full manuscript reviews, and hand-search of reference lists of relevant papers. Selected questionnaires were evaluated by two independent raters against the EBA criteria and classified into “well established”, “approaching well-established”, and “promising” categories. The electronic searches yielded 9888 articles, 24 of which met the inclusion criteria. Hand searches identified additional 21 studies. The 45 identified studies reported on 24 versions of 10 memory questionnaires assessed working memory, everyday memory, prospective and retrospective memory, and self-awareness of memory functions. Based on EBA criteria, only one memory questionnaire (The Working Memory Rating Scale – 20 item version) was classified as “well-established”, 3 as “approaching well-established”, and 20 as “promising”. Most (n = 19) had good reliability but lacked concurrent validity; had low or no correlations with objective memory tests, and low predictive power.

Using 20-year follow-up data from a unique natural experiment – the large-scale adoption of children exposed to extreme deprivation in Romanian institutions in the 1980s –we examined, for the first time, whether such deficits are still present in adulthood and whether they are associated with deprivation-related symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods Adult neuropsychological functioning was assessed across five domains (inhibitory control, emotion recognition, decision-making, prospective memory and IQ) in 70 previously institutionalized adoptees (mean age = 25.3, 50% female) and 22 non-deprived UK adoptees (comparison group, mean age = 24.6, 41% female). ADHD and ASD symptoms were assessed using parent-completed questionnaires. Results Early institutionalization was associated with impaired performance on all tasks in adulthood. Prospective memory deficits persisted after controlling for IQ. ADHD and ASD symptoms were positively correlated. After controlling for ASD symptoms, ADHD symptoms remained associated with deficits in IQ, prospective memory, proactive inhibition, decision-making quality and emotion recognition. ASD symptoms were not independently associated with neuropsychological deficits when accounting for their overlap with ADHD symptoms. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the link between childhood deprivation and adult ADHD symptoms was statistically explained by deprivation-related differences in adult IQ and prospective memory. Conclusions These results represent some of the most compelling evidence to date of the enduring power of early, time-limited childhood adversity to impair long-term neuropsychological functioning across the lifespan – effects that are linked specifically to deprivation-related adult ADHD symptoms.","","","","8487d5758ced07a1f2926f653f88124527943262","","","","","","The impact of childhood deprivation on adult neuropsychological functioning is associated with ADHD symptom persistence","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8487d5758ced07a1f2926f653f88124527943262","","2020"

Fish genotoxicity biomarkers are vital to identify and complement chemical parameters for determining environmental risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it was of interest to examine the eco-genotoxicity attributed to water pollution over different stream sections of Brazilian rivers by using Cichlasoma paranaense (Teleostei: Cichlidae), a neotropical freshwater cichlid ﬁsh, as a biological model. Chemical analysis of water and sediments collected from different Brazilian rivers sites demonstrated contamination by metals. Cichlasoma paranaense were collected at a reference location (a permanent water preservation area), maintained in the lab under standard conditions (controlled temperature, lighting, daily feeding, and constant aeration) and exposed to environmental samples of water and sediments. Subsequently, micronucleus (MN) and nuclear abnormalities (NA) frequencies were assessed in erythrocytes obtained from the caudal and gill regions. The highest concentrations of Cu were found in samples from river sites with forest fragmentation attributed to intensive agriculture practices. Similarly, exposure of fish to samples from agricultural areas induced significantly higher number of genotoxic effects. There was no marked difference between the tissues (tail and gill) regarding the observed frequencies of MN and NA. Thus C. paranaense fish served as a reliable model for detecting genotoxic effects, especially when water samples were collected near the discharge of agrochemicals. Evidence indicates that this method be considered for other global river sites which are also exposed to agrochemicals discharges containing Cu.","","","","07e19b89864bfd986cc01b94f91cfa795393bf49","","","","","","Using native fish in eco-genotoxic assessment of heavy metal contamination pollution arising from nearby large Brazilian rivers","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07e19b89864bfd986cc01b94f91cfa795393bf49","","2023"
"165",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Human pressure due to industrial and agricultural development has resulted in a biodiversity crisis. Environmental pollution is one of its drivers, including contamination of wildlife by chemicals emitted into the air, soil, and water. Chemicals released into the environment, even at low concentrations, may pose a negative effect on organisms. These chemicals might modify the synthesis, metabolism, and mode of action of hormones. This can lead to failures in reproduction, growth, and development of organisms potentially impacting their fitness. In this review, we focused on assessing the current knowledge on concentrations and possible effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals (metals, persistent organic pollutants, and others) in studies performed in South America, with findings at reproductive and thyroid levels. Our literature search revealed that most studies have focused on measuring the concentrations of compounds that act as endocrine disruptors in animals at the systemic level. However, few studies have evaluated the effects at a reproductive level, while information at thyroid disorders is scarce. Most studies have been conducted in fish by researchers from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Comparison of results across studies is difficult due to the lack of standardization of units in the reported data. Future studies should prioritize research on emergent contaminants, evaluate effects on native species and the use of current available methods such as the OMICs. Additionally, there is a primary focus on organisms related to aquatic environments, and those inhabiting terrestrial environments are scarce or nonexistent. Finally, we highlight a lack of funding at a national level in the reviewed topic that may influence the observed low scientific productivity in several countries, which is often negatively associated with their percentage of protected areas.","","","","c2557e6b62e6c152dd7c42c6542d2017a5db0a32","","","","","","South American National Contributions to Knowledge of the Effects of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Wild Animals: Current and Future Directions","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2557e6b62e6c152dd7c42c6542d2017a5db0a32","","2022"

In this study, the dose- and time-dependent effects of NP and OP were investigated in the primary hepatocyte culture of Van Fish. In this study, samples were taken at different times and biochemical parameters were studied separately. The effects of the chemicals used on SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA, and 8-OHdG were investigated in hepatocyte culture. The antioxidants SOD and CAT were observed to increase in all groups in the primary hepatocyte cultures at the 24th hour after NP and OP administration, whereas the GSH-Px level was observed to increase with OP at the 24th hour and with NP at the 48th hour. The MDA level was observed to reach its highest value for both chemicals in the 24th hour, and the 8-OHdG level was observed to increase toward the end of the follow-up time, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, different doses of NP and OP were found to induce an increase in the levels of antioxidants and the MDA level in Van Fish primary hepatocyte culture. DNA damage, on the other hand, may be considered to appear after longer-term exposure to NP and OP.","","","","7344872c24a763661009d375d66fc38867b8d599","","","","","","Antioxidant responses and DNA damage in primary hepatocytes of Van fish (Alburnus tarichi, Güldenstadt 1814) exposed to nonylphenol or octylphenol","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7344872c24a763661009d375d66fc38867b8d599","","2018"

Chronic toxicity assays were performed following an ISO guideline in a Tropical Artificial Soil (TAS), and the influence on the number and growth of the juveniles produced were determined. The range of nominal concentrations used in the tests with the individual compounds was 0.08–1.28 mg/kg (IMI), 0.079–1.264 mg/kg (FIP) and 0.007–0.112 mg/kg (CLO), whereas the mixture assays were performed with half the value used in the tests with individual compounds. Based upon single exposures, IMI produced a similar impact of reducing reproduction by 50% (EC50 ranging from 0.74 to 0.85 mg/kg) compared to FIP (EC50 = 0.78 mg/kg), whereas CLO was the most toxic to F. candida (EC50 = 0.08 mg/kg). Their mixtures generally resulted in a diminished effect on reproduction, as evidenced by the higher EC50 values. In contrast, in the case of the IMI+FIP combination at high concentrations at the EC50 level, a synergistic effect on toxicity was observed. The single exposure to the three insecticides and the mixture of IMI-FIP also decreased the size of generated juveniles, which was evidenced by the reduction in the proportion of large juveniles and increased proportion of small juveniles. However, both binary mixtures (IMI-FIP and IMI-CLO) presented antagonistic effects as evidenced by less than expected reductions in growth. Data on the toxic effects of IMI in a mixture with other seed dressing insecticides to collembolans provides useful information to environmental risk assessors by diminishing the uncertainties on the ecological risk of exposure to pesticides, enabling soil management degradation by utilizing multiple insecticides.","","","","a1bb6e6f219503a87560727a8364a5705651f220","","","","","","Individual and combined toxicity of imidacloprid and two seed dressing insecticides on collembolans Folsomia candida","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1bb6e6f219503a87560727a8364a5705651f220","","2023"

"174",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Abstract The lateral hypothalamus is critical for the control of ingestive behavior and spontaneous physical activity (SPA), as lesion or stimulation of this region alters these behaviors. Evidence points to lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons as modulators of feeding and SPA. These neurons affect a broad range of systems, and project to multiple brain regions such as the dorsal raphe nucleus, which contains serotoninergic neurons (DRN) important to energy homeostasis. Physical activity is comprised of intentional exercise and SPA. These are opposite ends of a continuum of physical activity intensity and structure. Non‐goal‐oriented behaviors, such as fidgeting, standing, and ambulating, constitute SPA in humans, and reflect a propensity for activity separate from intentional activity, such as high‐intensity voluntary exercise. In animals, SPA is activity not influenced by rewards such as food or a running wheel. Spontaneous physical activity in humans and animals burns calories and could theoretically be manipulated pharmacologically to expend calories and protect against obesity. The DRN neurons receive orexin inputs, and project heavily onto cortical and subcortical areas involved in movement, feeding and energy expenditure (EE). This review discusses the function of hypothalamic orexin in energy‐homeostasis, the interaction with DRN serotonin neurons, and the role of this orexin‐serotonin axis in regulating food intake, SPA, and EE. In addition, we discuss possible brain areas involved in orexin–serotonin cross‐talk; the role of serotonin receptors, transporters and uptake‐inhibitors in the pathogenesis and treatment of obesity; animal models of obesity with impaired serotonin‐function; single‐nucleotide polymorphisms in the serotonin system and obesity; and future directions in the orexin–serotonin field.

"175",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Abstract Predator‐inducible defenses constitute a widespread form of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and such defenses have recently been suggested linked with the neuroendocrine system. The neuroendocrine system is a target of endocrine disruptors, such as psychoactive pharmaceuticals, which are common aquatic contaminants. We hypothesized that exposure to an antidepressant pollutant, fluoxetine, influences the physiological stress response in our model species, crucian carp, affecting its behavioral and morphological responses to predation threat. We examined short‐ and long‐term effects of fluoxetine and predator exposure on behavior and morphology in crucian carp. Seventeen days of exposure to a high dose of fluoxetine (100 µg/L) resulted in a shyer phenotype, regardless of the presence/absence of a pike predator, but this effect disappeared after long‐term exposure. Fluoxetine effects on morphological plasticity were context‐dependent as a low dose (1 µg/L) only influenced crucian carp body shape in pike presence. A high dose of fluoxetine strongly influenced body shape regardless of predator treatment. Our results highlight that environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals could disrupt physiological regulation of ecologically important inducible defenses.","","","","5ecf950f95fa5e96ef7d1dfb9099b2c1b4e2b24b","","","","","","Antipredator phenotype in crucian carp altered by a psychoactive drug","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ecf950f95fa5e96ef7d1dfb9099b2c1b4e2b24b","","2021"

"179",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background The aquatic environment has been contaminated with various anthropogenic pollutants, including psychoactive compounds that may alter the physiology and behavior of free-living organisms. The present study focused on the condition and related mortality of the juvenile chub (Squalius cephalus). The aim of the study was to test whether the adverse effects of the antidepressants sertraline and citalopram, the analgesic tramadol and the illicit drug methamphetamine, on fish condition exist under environmentally relevant concentrations and whether these effects persist after a depuration period. Innovative analyses of the fish brain concentrations of these compounds were performed with the aim to show relationship between compound brain tissue concentration and fish condition. Methods The laboratory experiment consisted of 42 days of exposure and a subsequent 14-day depuration period with regular monitoring of the condition and mortality of exposed and control fish. Identical methodology, including individual brain concentration analyses for the tested compounds, was applied for all substances. Additional study on feeding under sertraline exposure was also conducted. The feeding was measured from the 28th day of the exposure, three times in a week, by observation of food intake during 15 minutes in social environment. Results The effects of particular psychoactive compounds on chub condition varied. While sertraline induced a lower condition and increased mortality, the effects of methamphetamine were inverse, and tramadol and citalopram had no significant effect at all. Individual brain concentrations of the tested compounds showed that the effects of sertraline and methamphetamine on fish condition were increased with brain concentration increases. Additionally, the food intake was reduced in case of sertraline. In contrast, there was no relationship between tramadol and citalopram brain tissue concentration and fish condition, suggesting that the concentration-dependent effect is strongly compound-specific. Methamphetamine was the only compound with a persistent effect after the depuration period. Our results demonstrate the suitability of the brain concentration evidence approach and suggest that changes in fish condition and other related parameters can be expected in freshwater ecosystems polluted with specific psychoactive compounds.","","","","2239dd93c7b350d1563433006006fac3cde9342c","","","","","","Environmentally relevant levels of four psychoactive compounds vary in their effects on freshwater fish condition: a brain concentration evidence approach","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2239dd93c7b350d1563433006006fac3cde9342c","","2020"

This fish is an important source of protein for the people living in Van and surrounding provinces. . Cypermethrin (CYP) is used extensively against insects in agricultural, livestock, and domestic applications in Lake Van basin. CYP has toxic effects highly on non-target organisms as aquatic animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial formulas of CYP (0.05 µg/L) on Van Lake fish (Alburnus tarichi) for 24, 48, 72, 96 h under semi-static conditions using oxidative damage biomarkers. In this study, antioxidant defense system enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and lipid peroxidation (LPO) product malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in the liver, kidney, gills, and brain tissues. According to the results of this study, the decrease in SOD (at 48, 72, and 96 h) and CAT and GPx (at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) enzyme activities were significant with exposure to CYP (p < 0.05). In addition, the increase in MDA levels, which is the indicator of LPO, was found to be significant (p < 0.05). However, in the 24 h period exposed to CYP, a significant increase in SOD activity was determined in kidney and brain compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, sublethal concentrate application of CYP is thought to cause oxidative stress and disrupt the oxidant, antioxidant balance of Lake Van fish.","","","","74c1ab46a2ea1566c11706752982040d15137e8f","","","","","","Effects of cypermethrin on antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation of Lake Van fish (Alburnus tarichi)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74c1ab46a2ea1566c11706752982040d15137e8f","","2020"

The widely prescribed antidiabetic metformin has the potential to accumulate and persist in water bodies, with unknown consequences for aquatic biota. This study reports the biological responses of a sentinel organism, common mussel Mytilus edulis, exposed to concentrations of metformin commonly found in the aquatic environment, coupled with heat stress. The results indicate that metformin has the potential to increase the vitellogenin mRNA expression, to inflict severe pathologies of the gonad and to destabilize the lysosomal membrane in the hemocytes. Overall, this article suggests that metformin should be considered an emerging contaminant of concern and further research should focus on its mechanisms of action.","","","","6dfea27e6fb98d95e18dfb443b95027f0478c732","","","","","","Impact of Metformin and Increased Temperature on Blue Mussels Mytilus edulis - Evidence for Synergism","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6dfea27e6fb98d95e18dfb443b95027f0478c732","","2018"

We aimed to assess the long-term outcomes and time to progression to anti-TNF treatment in VEOIBD patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed IBD patients diagnosed under 6 years of age, between January 2005 and December 2019, from the British-Columbia (BC) Pediatric IBD database. Demographic data, disease characteristics, disease location and severity were documented. Data on anti-TNF treatment at initiation and during follow up including type of biologic, dosing, and response were collected. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the number of years to progression to anti-TNF treatment and the parameters influencing commencement. Results: Eighty-nine patients with VEOIBD were diagnosed during the study period. Median age at diagnosis was 3.8 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.6–5.1], 45.3% had Crohn disease (CD) and 62.8% were males. Median duration of follow up was 6.39 years (IQR 3.71–10.55). Anti-TNF treatment was started on 39.5% of patients and 7.0% underwent surgery. Rapid progression to biologic treatment was associated with Perianal fistulizing disease or stricturing disease in CD patients (P = 0.026, P = 0.033, respectively), and disease severity (P = 0.017) in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The median dose of infliximab at 1 year was 10 mg/kg (IQR 7.5–11) and a median dose interval of 4.5 weeks (IQR 4–6). Clinical remission was reported in 61.8% of patients on their first biologic agent. Conclusions: The response rate was higher than previously reported and might be due to higher infliximab dosing with shorter infusion intervals than standard dosing.","","","","0a7abbbb996f512c3af43b13518531873b5cb1d0","","","","","","Progression to Anti-TNF Treatment in Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a7abbbb996f512c3af43b13518531873b5cb1d0","","2022"

The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of PIBD in Turkey, according to the age at diagnosis. Methods: The data of 176 children with IBD who were followed in our center were analyzed. Patients were divided into early (EO-IBD, onset at 2 to <10 years) and later-onset (LO-IBD, 10 to ≤17 years) IBD according to the age at diagnosis. Patients’ data with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) were compared. Results: Of 176 patients, 47 (26.7%) were diagnosed with EO-IBD. Patients with early-onset ulcerative colitis (EO-UC) had the highest rate of family history of IBD (17.6%). Pancolitis was the most common form of UC regardless of the age at onset. The rate of moderate-severe disease activity in later-onset UC (62.5%) was higher than in EO-UC (37.5%). A higher rate of extraintestinal manifestations was observed in EO-IBD patients, particularly in EO-UC (38.2%) than in LO-IBD patients. Patients with early-onset CD (EO-CD) had predominantly colonic involvement and nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease behavior. The rate of perianal disease in patients with later-onset CD (LO-CD) (64.5%) was noticeably higher than those with EO-CD (23%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with EO-UC represented a distinct phenotype with a mild disease activity, high rate of extraintestinal symptoms, and a high proportion of family history. The analysis of our IBD cohort also demonstrated remarkably high rate of perianal disease, particularly in patients with LO-CD.","","","","740fa92b37e157e83e59ccb2fe0c719da14b1481","","","","","","Phenotypic Pattern of Early Versus Later-Onset Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease in a Eurasian Country","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/740fa92b37e157e83e59ccb2fe0c719da14b1481","","2022"
"200",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background/Aims Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), defined as IBD diagnosed in patients younger than 6 years, is a challenge for pediatric gastroenterologists. Although there have been reports regarding VEO-IBD in Western countries, those in Asia are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features of Japanese VEO-IBD patients. Methods Patients with VEO-IBD diagnosed between 2006 and 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. The disease phenotypes were classified into ulcerative colitis type (UC-type) and Crohn’s disease type (CD-type), and the clinical features and courses were compared between the phenotypes. Results Overall, 54 VEO-IBD patients (19 patients with UC-type and 35 patients with CD-type) were evaluated. The median age at onset was 18 months. One patient had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and 9 patients had monogenic IBD. Monogenic IBD was more prevalent in the CD-type patients with perianal disease (CD-type (PD)). The age at onset was significantly lower in the CD-type group (P<0.05). The most common initial symptom was bloody stools (70%), followed by diarrhea (63%), weight loss (24%), fever (20%), and perianal disease (20%). Excluding patients with SCID and monogenic IBD, 23 out of 44 patients (52%) required biologics. The biologics were switched in 11 out of 44 patients (25%), and the majority of these patients (82%) were in the CD-type group. Overall, 9 patients (20%) required intestinal resection or ostomy placement. Conclusions CD-type tends to occur at an earlier age, and monogenic IBD occurs significantly more frequently in CD-type (PD). Disease severity and treatment should be individualized, owing to the disease heterogeneity.","","","","519cd10484561f1959478d6ed11c83a5a5e10c1e","","","","","","Clinical features of very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease in Japan: a retrospective single-center study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/519cd10484561f1959478d6ed11c83a5a5e10c1e","","2022"
"201",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Background: Research on the utilization and effectiveness of antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics in children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) is urgently needed. Here we describe anti-TNF use and durability in a multicenter cohort. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with VEOIBD (<6 years) between 2008 and 2013 at 25 North American centers. We performed chart abstraction at diagnosis and 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. We examined the rate of initiation and durability of infliximab and adalimumab and evaluated associations between treatment durability and the following covariates with multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression: age at diagnosis, sex, disease duration, disease classification, and presence of combined immunomodulatory treatment versus monotherapy. Results: Of 294 children with VEOIBD, 120 initiated treatment with anti-TNF therapy and 101 had follow-up data recorded [50% Crohn disease (CD), 31% ulcerative colitis (UC), and 19% IBD unclassified (IBD-U)]. The cumulative probability of anti-TNF treatment was 15% at 1 year, 30% at 3 years, and 45% at 5 years from diagnosis; 56 (55%) were treated between 0 and 6 years old. Anti-TNF durability was 90% at 1 year, 75% at 3 years, and 55% at 5 years. The most common reason for discontinuation of anti-TNF were loss of response in 24 (57%) children. Children with UC/IBD-U had lower durability than those with CD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06–0.51; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Utilization and durability of anti-TNF in VEOIBD is relatively high and comparable with older children. Having Crohn disease (compared with UC/IBD-U) is associated with greater durability.","","","","e4938a8b192b01e58c511872414979036429697e","","","","","","Utilization of Antitumor Necrosis Factor Biologics in Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study From North America","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4938a8b192b01e58c511872414979036429697e","","2022"

Methods: A population-based retrospective cohort study of all <10-year-olds diagnosed with IBD between 2004 and 2017 in Southwest England was performed. Patients were divided into age groups at diagnosis. Demographics, investigations, and phenotype at diagnosis were collected. Treatments and outcomes were analysed at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up. Poisson regression was used for IBD incidence rate ratios; Wald test for variation by age group; parametric/nonparametric tests for phenotype. Results: There were 666 new paediatric IBD (pIBD) patients ages ≤16 years, from which 136 were 2 to 9 (2–5 years: 32; 6–9 years: 104). Incidence of pIBD increased from 4 to 6 cases per 100,000 whereas in A1a group was stable around 2 cases per 100,000. Crohn Disease (CD) children were majority boys, 2- to 5-year-olds were more likely to have ileal sparing than 6 to 9-year group but had similar rates of surgery and anti-TNF therapy. Two- to 5-year-olds with ulcerative colitis were more likely to have surgery but rates for anti-TNF therapy were similar. Sixteen percent of 2- to 5-year-olds and 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds had IBD-unclassified. No significant differences in symptoms or time to diagnosis were found. Conclusions: Twenty percent of pIBD in Southwest England are 2 to 9 years old. pIBD incidence has increased but is stable in that group. In terms of phenotypic differences, ileal sparing in CD and pancolitis and surgery in UC, are more likely in 2- to 5-year-olds.","","","","b0f4b1f7023599cf37bb12334031cca54ed7423d","","","","","","Change in Incidence and Epidemiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in 2- to 9-Year-olds in Southwest England","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0f4b1f7023599cf37bb12334031cca54ed7423d","","2021"
"204",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disabling disease, characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon, with a rising prevalence worldwide in the pediatric age group. Although UC presents in children with varying severity, disease extent, and comorbidities, initial treatment is essentially uniform, consisting of 5-aminosalicylate drugs with corticosteroid induction for those with moderately to severely active disease. With the advent of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic therapy and several new biologics and small-molecule drugs for UC, precision medicine approaches to treatment are needed to more rapidly achieve sustained remission, restore quality of life, normalize development, and limit exposure to toxic corticosteroids in children with UC. Here, we review available data on clinical, biochemical, histopathologic, and molecular predictors of treatment response in UC. We also address known predictors and special treatment considerations in specific relevant scenarios such as very-early-onset UC, acute severe UC, ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and UC with concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The review concludes with a prediction of how machine learning will integrate multimodal patient data to bring precision medicine to the bedside of children with UC in the future.","","","","1e89c5aaf9d82d6475c3881b5bcb94a1f42596bb","","","","","","Predicting Therapeutic Response in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis—A Journey Towards Precision Medicine","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e89c5aaf9d82d6475c3881b5bcb94a1f42596bb","","2021"
"205",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Purpose of review Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a rare presentation defined as onset of intestinal inflammation at the age of <6 years. Some of these young children develop IBD because of inherent defects in immune or epithelial cell function resulting from deleterious mutations in genes involved in mucosal homeostasis. Here, we provide an overview of the clinical, genetic and immunologic approach in patients with VEO-IBD. Recent findings More than 50 different monogenic disorders directly causing IBD have been identified in the last decade; most of them present with unique clinical features in the first years of life. Such a diagnosis may facilitate the administration of targeted therapies and is important for genetic counseling. Nevertheless, a monogenic disorder is identified only in a minority of patients with VEO-IBD. Consequently, different demographic, clinical and histologic features should prompt a detailed genetic and immunologic workup in patients with IBD. Summary A diagnosis of monogenic IBD can have a huge impact on patient's care, enabling in some cases to provide personalized therapies. Clinicians should be aware of unique features of such disorders, and complete a detailed genetic and immune workup in selected cases, even when disease manifests beyond a young age.","","","","cf471d0951f5eb9eaaccb2dd262b60470cbc88f7","","","","","","Evaluation of very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf471d0951f5eb9eaaccb2dd262b60470cbc88f7","","2020"

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the treatment and progress of early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: This prospective survey evaluated the data of 43 patients aged <8 years who were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the time of diagnosis to 36 months after registration. Results: A total of 12 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), 21 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 with unclassified IBD were enrolled. The mean disease onset age was 3 years and 7 months. Colon and anal lesions were present in 100 and 50% of patients with CD, respectively. Granulomas were detected in 5 patients (41.7%). Dietary elimination including elemental diet was performed in all patients. Eleven patients (91.7%) were in remission by initial induction therapy, and 72.7% maintained remission for 36 months. Three patients (14.3%) with UC had familial history, 71.4% had pancolitis-type UC, and 66.7% exhibited disease of moderate severity. Colectomy was performed in 4 patients (21.1%). Eighteen patients (85.7%) were in remission by initial induction therapy; however, only 15.8% maintained remission for 36 months. Anal complication was more prevalent in infantile-onset IBD than in childhood-onset IBD (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Among Japanese patients aged <8 years who were diagnosed with IBD, colitis-type disease was more common in CD and pancolitis was more common in UC. As the courses of several patients were severe, identifying primary immunodeficiency appears to be necessary to confirm background disease.","","","","772afb9d0e702643d82d33a5228e9fc425115fb9","","","","","","A Multicenter Prospective Survey on Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Japan","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/772afb9d0e702643d82d33a5228e9fc425115fb9","","2020"
"209",":Paper","CC-BY","The rate of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been increasing over the last decade and this increase has occurred most rapidly in the youngest children diagnosed <6 years, known as very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). These children can present with more extensive and severe disease than older children and adults. The contribution of host genetics in this population is underscored by the young age of onset and the distinct, aggressive phenotype. In fact, monogenic defects, often involving primary immunodeficiency genes, have been identified in children with VEO-IBD and have led to targeted and life-saving therapy. This position paper will discuss the phenotype of VEO-IBD and outline the approach and evaluation for these children and what factors should trigger concern for an underlying immunodeficiency. We will then review the immunological assays and genetic studies that can facilitate the identification of the underlying diagnosis in patients with VEO-IBD and how this evaluation may lead to directed therapies. The position paper will also aid the pediatric gastroenterologist in recognizing when a patient should be referred to a center specializing in the care of these patients.

Avoiding complications, surgery and malignancy, alongside minimizing the side effects of medications are vital. However, the reality of treatment involves patients losing response to therapy, or developing complications requiring cessation of medication. The reasons underlying this are numerous and include medication and host-related influences. Underpinning the response to medication, long-term outcomes and loss of response are individual etiological factors including the molecular cause of disease and individual pharmacogenomic influences. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the long-term outcome of IBD, with a focus on pediatric-onset illness and discuss the factors leading to loss of treatment response whilst briefly considering the future of personalized therapy as a strategy to improve long-term outcomes. Expert opinion: Research findings are now moving toward clinical translation, including application of novel medications targeting new pathways. The integration of biological and multiomic data to predict disease outcome will provide personalized therapeutic management.","","","","a78538805a00090188c1635b8913328bc4d4acb3","","","","","","Inflammatory bowel disease: long-term therapeutic challenges","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a78538805a00090188c1635b8913328bc4d4acb3","","2019"
"213",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Objectives: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic diseases which negatively affect the schooling of children. The aim is to analyze school absenteeism and its causes in children followed for IBD. Methods: A prospective multicenter study of IBD patients aged from 5 to 18 years old, from September 2016 to June 2017. Data on absenteeism and its causes were collected via a monthly questionnaire completed by patients or their family by mail. The results were compared with existing data supplied by the school authorities (497 students without IBD divided by class). Results: A total of 106 patients (62 boys), median age of 14 (5–18), were included. The global response rate was 83.1%. The patients with IBD were absent an average of 4.8% ± 5.5% of school days during the school year, against 3.2% ± 1.6% for non IBD group (P = 0.034). Digestive disorders accounted for 34% of the causes of absenteeism. Approximately 27% of the absences were due to scheduled events (hospitalizations, endoscopy, or consultations). By excluding the absences for scheduled care, the rate of school absenteeism of patients with IBD is significantly lower than that of non-IBD group. Conclusion: Children with IBD are more frequently absent from school than non-IBD group. The main cause of school absenteeism appears to be associated with the disease itself. The share of scheduled absenteeism is quite large. The organization and scheduling of the patients’ care path must be a priority to maximally limit the negative impact of their disease on the patients’ schooling.","","","","e5b5f061c7d1af07b3feac36908a9b8cba1c6b79","","","","","","Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and School Absenteeism","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5b5f061c7d1af07b3feac36908a9b8cba1c6b79","","2019"

The Paris modification of the Montreal classification for children with inflammatory bowel disease was accepted in 2011. We aimed to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with IBD during childhood in a population-based cohort according to the Paris classification at diagnosis.


Methods
The medical records of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients, diagnosed from 2000 to 2016, were reviewed retrospectively. Main outcome measures included time to first flare, hospitalisation, surgery, and biologic therapy.


Results
In Crohn's disease patients [n = 301, median age 14.2 years], colonic location was associated with higher prevalence of extraintestinal manifestations, whereas ileal location and complicated behaviour were associated with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positivity. During a median follow-up of 9.1 years (interquartile range [IQR]of 4.7-12.3), complicated behaviour at diagnosis was associated with increased risk for surgery (hazard ratio[ HR] = 2.7, p < 0.001] and hospitalisation [HR = 1.5, p = 0.01] but not with the risk for flare or stepping-up to biologic therapy. Isolated colonic disease was associated with a decreased risk of surgery [HR = 0.25, p = 0.02]. During a median follow-up of 8.5 years [interquartile range of 5.1-12], in patients with ulcerative colitis [n = 126, median age 13.7 years], severe disease at diagnosis but not disease extent was associated with the risk for colectomy [HR = 3.5, p = 0.002], hospitalisation [HR = 3.3, p < 0.001], flare [HR = 2.4, p < 0.001] and biologic therapy [HR = 2.6, p = 0.001].


Conclusions
The Paris classification for paediatric inflammatory bowel disease has clear predictive properties. Complicated disease and ileal location at diagnosis in Crohn's disease, and severity of disease but not its extension in ulcerative colitis, predict long-term worse outcomes.","","","","643fa0caad3d729730b780af8cc0d9e04d15bd39","","","","","","The Long-Term Predictive Properties of the Paris Classification in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/643fa0caad3d729730b780af8cc0d9e04d15bd39","","2018"

Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study. We reviewed the charts of patients with UC diagnosed between 2 and 18 years at our referral center from January 2007 to January 2016. Laboratory and clinical features at diagnosis, such as disease extent, atypical phenotypes, extraintestinal manifestations, and therapies, and pattern changes during the follow-up, including relapse rate, disease extension, and the cumulative risk for colectomy were collected. Results: One hundred eleven patients were enrolled. Atypical phenotypes were identified at diagnosis in 55 out of 111 patients (49.5%). Extraintestinal manifestations were detected in 16 out of 111 (14.4%) at the diagnosis. During the follow-up 60 out of 111 (54%) patients needed to start azathioprine, 9 out of 111 (8.1%) patients started biologic therapy and 10 out of 111 (patients underwent surgery, resulting in a cumulative risk of 8% at 5 years and 16% at 10 years. Steroid refractoriness (hazard ratio: 13.9) and starting of biologic therapy (hazard ratio: 25.3) represented the best predictors for surgery. The cumulative probability of first relapse was 47% at 6 months and 63% at 1 year. Disease extension was reported in 21 out of 70 patients (30%).

"223",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The incidence and prevalence of childhood-onset inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, have risen dramatically in recent years, and have emerged globally as important pediatric chronic diseases. Therefore, health care providers are more frequently encountering very young children with IBD, a chronic and incurable condition requiring life-long therapy. These children are living long lives with IBD and therefore knowledge of long-term outcomes is increasingly important to better counsel families and determine the best course of treatment. This review summarizes the current knowledge and literature surrounding long-term outcomes of pediatric IBD, with emphasis on the following areas: need for surgery due to complicated disease behavior, risk of disease remission and recurrence, mental health and psychosocial well-being, educational outcomes, linear growth impairment, cancer risk, and mortality. In addition, we review recent research about predicting negative long-term outcomes in children with IBD.","","","","ce1aaac6e5c88a8a39cbf9862fe414dd106fde75","","","","","","Long-term outcomes of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce1aaac6e5c88a8a39cbf9862fe414dd106fde75","","2017"
"224",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Objective There are inconsistent reports on age-related differences in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). On the basis of patient information, we describe the clinical presentation and therapy in relation to age at diagnosis in longstanding pediatric IBD. Patients and methods Two surveys were conducted in children and young adults (age: 10–25 years) by pretested postal questionnaires. The main analyses are descriptive, showing proportions and distributions per grouped age of diagnosis. Exploratory logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and disease-related factors associated with prognosis. Recent disease course, use of biological therapy, and resecting surgery were chosen as indicators of disease severity. Patients with a diagnosis in infancy (<2 years of age) are presented as a case series. Results Information of 1280 cases was available [804 Crohn’s disease (CD), 382 ulcerative colitis (UC), 94 IBD not specified] (response: 44.6 and 49.6%). Stable remission during the preceding year was reported by 675 (56.7%) patients; 825 (60.9%) patients reported feeling currenty well. Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was reported by 33% of CD patients and 9.3% of UC patients, immunomodulation in 82.1 and 63.2%, and corticosteroids by 78.4 and 76.1%, respectively (ever use). Age at diagnosis was not associated with indicators of severe disease. Diagnosis in infancy was reported by 37 patients.

"225",":Paper","CC-BY","An awareness of the expected time for therapies to induce symptomatic improvement and remission is necessary for determining the timing of follow-up, disease (re)assessment, and the duration to persist with therapies, yet this is seldom reported as an outcome in clinical trials. In this review, we explore the time to clinical response and remission of current therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as medication, patient and disease related factors that may influence the time to clinical response. It appears that the time to therapeutic response varies depending on the indication for therapy (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis). Agents with the most rapid time to clinical response included corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, exclusive enteral nutrition, aminosalicylates and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy which will work in most patients within the first 2 mo. Vedolizumab, methotrexate and thiopurines had a longer time to clinical response and can take several months to achieve maximal efficacy. Factors affecting the time to clinical response of therapies included use of concomitant therapy, disease duration, smoking status, disease phenotype and advanced age. There appears to be marked variation in time to clinical response for therapies used in IBD which is further influenced by disease and patient related factors. Understanding the expected time to therapeutic response is integral to inform further decision making, maintain a patient-centered approach and ensure treatment is given an appropriate timeframe to achieve maximal benefit prior to cessation.","","","","31df0ca7640318f9f11decd48dea782e395a6dff","","","","","","Time to clinical response and remission for therapeutics in inflammatory bowel diseases: What should the clinician expect, what should patients be told?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31df0ca7640318f9f11decd48dea782e395a6dff","","2017"
"226",":Paper","CC-BY","Abstract Aim The onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients younger than the age of 5 years is rare. Moreover, when there is exclusive colonic inflammation, diagnosis can be challenging. Our aim was to describe the difficulties and pitfalls in the diagnosis of early-onset IBD (eoIBD) and their repercussions in treatment decisions. Patients and Methods Patients with eoIBD (Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative, and unclassified colitis) treated at our center between 1990 and 2016 were studied retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, medical, and surgical treatment data were analyzed. Results A total of 19 patients were diagnosed with eoIBD at 21 (1–46) months of age. Bloody diarrhea, growth failure, and abdominal pain were present in 90, 42, and 16%, respectively. After 9 (1–62) months from the onset, patients were classified as ulcerative colitis (nine), CD (two), and unclassified colitis (eight). Unresponsiveness to medical treatment was observed in 10 and prompted surgical assessment. A partial colectomy was performed in one, and nine underwent a total colectomy (one end stoma and eight ileoanal anastomosis [IAA]). At least one surgical complication occurred in 80% and ultimately six patients with an IAA required an end stoma. Overtime, final diagnosis of 5 out of the 10 surgical patients changed due to biopsy findings, unresponsiveness to medical treatment, or extraintestinal and perianal manifestations. After a 12-year (1–22) follow-up, 57.9% of the diagnoses of all patients were modified. Conclusion EoIBD poses a challenge due to ambiguous presentation and absence of specific diagnostic tests. Surgical evaluation is often needed and surgeons must be mindful of possible initial misdiagnosis, in addition to short- and long-term outcomes before deciding aggressive surgical measures as well as intestinal reconstruction.","","","","a17fce1f34e204338226763e39923bd06434066d","","","","","","Pitfalls in Diagnosis of Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a17fce1f34e204338226763e39923bd06434066d","","2017"

"228",":Paper","CC-BY","Background: Although perianal complications of Crohn disease (CD) are commonly encountered in clinical practice, the epidemiology of perianal CD among populations of children is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the prevalence of perianal disease in a large and diverse population of pediatric patients with CD. Methods: We conducted retrospective analyses from a prospective observational cohort, the ImproveCareNow Network (May 2006–October 2014), a multicenter pediatric inflammatory bowel disease quality improvement collaborative. Clinicians prospectively documented physical examination and phenotype classification at outpatient visits. Perianal examination findings and concomitant phenotype change were used to corroborate time of new-onset perianal disease. Results were stratified by age, sex, and race and compared across groups with logistic regression. Cumulative incidence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared between groups with Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: The registry included 7076 patients with CD (41% girls). Missing/conflicting entries resulted in 397 (6%) patient exclusions. Among the remaining 6679 cases, 1399 (21%) developed perianal disease. Perianal disease was more common among boys (22%) than girls (20%; P = 0.013) and developed sooner after diagnosis among those with later rather than early onset disease (P < 0.001). Perianal disease was also more common among blacks (26%) compared with whites (20%; P = 0.017). Asians with later onset CD developed perianal disease earlier in their disease course (P = 0.01). There was no association between disease location or nutritional status at diagnosis and later development of perianal disease. Conclusions: In this large multicenter collaborative, we found that perianal disease is more common among children with CD than previously recognized. Differences in the development of perianal disease were found across racial and other subgroups. Treatment strategies are needed to prevent perianal disease development.","","","","65aa6940ad26407dc7a2db339ccd253f56848bd4","","","","","","Perianal Crohn Disease in a Large Multicenter Pediatric Collaborative","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65aa6940ad26407dc7a2db339ccd253f56848bd4","","2017"

"232",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Background: Interleukin-10 (IL10) signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) in children. However, little is known about the role of the IL10 axis in children with VEO-IBD in China. Methods: The Chinese VEO-IBD Collaboration Group was created to collect clinical and genetic data from patients deficient in IL10 and the IL10 receptor. High-throughput sequencing was performed to identify mutations in these genes. Results: We identified 32 compound heterozygous mutations and 9 homozygous mutations in IL10 receptor subunit alpha and 1 homozygous mutation in IL10 receptor subunit beta. Among these mutations, 10 novel mutations were identified, and 6 pathogenic mutations had been previously described. In patients with IL10 receptor subunit alpha mutations, c.301C>T (p.R101RW) and c.537 G>A (p.T179T) were the most common mutations. For 88.1% of the patients, the initial symptom was diarrhea, with a time of onset of 10.4 ± 8.0 days. Oral ulcers were the first symptom in 23.8% of the patients, with a time of onset of 9.7 ± 2.8 days. Extraintestinal manifestations included perianal abscesses (22/42), perianal fistulas (23/42), oral ulcers (20/42), and recurrent eczema (15/42). Twelve patients underwent enterostomy. These patients also had lower average Z scores in height-for-age and weight-for-age. Various treatment strategies were used, including fecal microbiota transplantation; however, only hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was efficacious. Conclusions: This study identified genotypes and phenotypes of Chinese VEO-IBD infants with IL10 receptor mutations. Our study expands the current knowledge on the involvement of the IL10 axis in patients with VEO-IBD.","","","","5a010a77f4c10b1c72e6ce280ccb442fcc62b6a0","","","","","","Mutations in Interleukin-10 Receptor and Clinical Phenotypes in Patients with Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Chinese VEO-IBD Collaboration Group Survey","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a010a77f4c10b1c72e6ce280ccb442fcc62b6a0","","2017"

Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease [VEO-IBD] is a form of IBD that is distinct from that of children with an older onset. We compared changes over time in the incidence and phenotype at diagnosis between two groups according to age at IBD diagnosis: VEO-IBD diagnosed before the age of 6 years, and early-onset IBD [EO-IBD] diagnosed between 6 and 16 years of age.


Methods
Data were obtained from a cohort enrolled in a prospective French population-based registry from 1988 to 2011.


Results
Among the 1412 paediatric cases [< 17 years], 42 [3%] were VEO-IBD. In the VEO-IBD group, the incidence remained stable over the study period. In contrast, the incidence of EO-IBD increased from 4.4/105 in 1988-1990 to 9.5/105 in 2009-2011 [+116%; p < 10-4]. Crohn's disease [CD] was the most common IBD, regardless of age, but ulcerative colitis [UC] and unclassified IBD were more common in VEO-IBD cases [40% vs 26%; p = 0.04]. VEO-IBD diagnosis was most often performed in hospital [69% vs 43%; p < 10-3]. Rectal bleeding and mucous stools were more common in patients with VEO-IBD, whereas weight loss and abdominal pain were more frequent in those with EO-IBD. Regarding CD, isolated colonic disease was more common in the VEO-IBD group [39% vs 14%; p = 0.003].


Conclusions
In this large population-based cohort, the incidence of VEO-IBD was low and stable from 1988 to 2011, with a specific clinical presentation. These results suggest a probable genetic origin for VEO-IBD, whereas the increase in EO-IBD might be linked to environmental factors.","","","","57a2fd50ecc1eb300f5663511aa7fa0bd3fa19fd","","","","","","Incidence and Phenotype at Diagnosis of Very-early-onset Compared with Later-onset Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Population-based Study [1988–2011]","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57a2fd50ecc1eb300f5663511aa7fa0bd3fa19fd","","2016"
"236",":Paper","CC-BY","AIM Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO-IBD) with the onset of disease before 12 mo of age, is a different disease entity from childhood IBD. We aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children with IO-IBD. METHODS All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 mo of age, seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We performed mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with presenting clinical features of Crohn’s disease (CD). RESULTS Six [13%; CD = 3, ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) = 1] of the 48 children (CD = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review [median (range) duration of follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were in remission without immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U), after standard immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three patients were on immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD) had persistent disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more likely to present with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar in terms of an associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31), requiring biologics therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P = 0.27), or achieving remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10 or IL10R in the three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were identified. CONCLUSION The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission at a similar rate.","","","","899f20505b59a775411220f377608780c2fa029f","","","","","","Variable outcome in infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease in an Asian cohort","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/899f20505b59a775411220f377608780c2fa029f","","2016"

Expert commentary: We found that females are less prone than males to develop monogenic disorders, which have X-linked heritability in several cases. Furthermore, the Crohn’s Diseases (CD) subtype seems to be suggestive of monogenic disorders while Unclassified IBD (IBDU) subtype is predominantly found in conventional/standard IBD at onset <6 years. Isolated colonic location is prevalent in both the subsets of IBD at onset <6 years if compared to IBD at later onset.

"242",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","BACKGROUND
Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), requiring timely and sufficient nutritional supplementation. In patients hospitalized for active disease, symptoms and/or altered intestinal function hinder enteral nutrition feasibility. In this scenario, parenteral nutrition (PN) is used. We aimed (1) to assess the frequency of PN use between 1997 and 2012 among hospitalized pediatric patients with IBD, (2) to determine the risk of in-hospital thrombus and infection associated with PN, and (3) to identify predictors of thrombus and infection in pediatric IBD hospitalizations utilizing PN.


METHODS
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of pediatric patients hospitalized between 1997 and 2012. We used the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) to identify pediatric patients (≤18 years of age) with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), PN exposure, and primary outcomes including thrombus and infection. We used multivariable regression to identify risk factors for outcomes of interest.


RESULTS
Parenteral nutrition was utilized in 3732 (12%) of 30,914 IBD hospitalizations. Three percent of PN patients experienced a thrombotic complication, and 5.5% experienced an infectious complication. Multivariate analysis showed PN as an independent risk factor for thrombus (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-5.6) and infection (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 3.1-4.6). Surgery was an independent risk factor for thrombus (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7) and infection (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0-3.1) in hospitalizations exposed to PN.


CONCLUSIONS
Hospitalized pediatric IBD patients, particularly surgical, receiving PN are at increased risk for thrombosis and infection. Clinicians must balance these risks with the benefits of PN.","","","","c169a7ed626931dad44e451b2f9ce49c30ef7d65","","","","","","Thrombotic and Infectious Risks of Parenteral Nutrition in Hospitalized Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c169a7ed626931dad44e451b2f9ce49c30ef7d65","","2018"

Most patients with IBD receive immunosuppressive therapies during the course of the disease. These molecules are a double-edged sword; while they can help control disease activity, they also increase the risk of infections. Therefore, it is important that pediatricians involved in primary care, pediatric gastroenterologists, and infectious disease physicians have a thorough knowledge of the infections that can affect patients with IBD. Areas covered: A broad review of the major infectious diseases that have been reported in children and adolescents with IBD was performed, and information regarding surveillance, diagnosis and management were updated. The possible correlations with IBD pharmacological tools are discussed. Expert commentary: Opportunistic infections are possible in pediatric IBD, and immunosuppressive and immunomodulator therapy seems to play a causative role.

The total effectiveness rate in the research group was 90.0%, significantly higher than 72.5% in the control group, and the difference had statistical significance (P < 0.05). Before treatment, we assessed the UCDAI and clinical symptoms, and found that there were no statistically significant differences in these indicators between two groups (P>0.05); however, after treatment, both of UCDAI and clinical symptoms scores were decreased evidently in two groups (P<0.05), while the decreases in the research group were more significant (P < 0.05).

Patients were excluded if they had significant therapeutic interventions (such as the start of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents) between the colonoscopy and the clinical assessment. Mayo endoscopic score of the rectum and sigmoid were done by two gastroenterologists. Inter-observer variability in Mayo score was assessed. RESULTS We identified 99 patients (53% female, 74% pancolitis) that met inclusion criteria. The indications for colonoscopy included ongoing disease activity (62%), consideration of medication change (10%), assessment of medication efficacy (14%), and cancer screening (14%). Based on PUCAI scores, 33% of patients were in remission, 39% had mild disease, 23% had moderate disease, and 4% had severe disease. There was “moderate-substantial” agreement between the two reviewers in assessing rectal Mayo scores (kappa = 0.54, 95%CI: 0.41-0.68). CONCLUSION Endoscopic disease severity (Mayo score) assessed by reviewing photographs of pediatric colonoscopy has moderate inter-rater reliability, and agreement was less robust in assessing patients with mild disease activity. Endoscopic disease severity generally correlates with clinical disease severity as measured by PUCAI score. However, children with inflamed colons can have significant variation in their reported clinical symptoms. Thus, assessment of both clinical symptoms and endoscopic disease severity may be required in future clinical studies.","","","","3487ab107b3dfb52cb7dc2f7872fa75c27538395","","","","","","Correlation of endoscopic disease severity with pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index score in children and young adults with ulcerative colitis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3487ab107b3dfb52cb7dc2f7872fa75c27538395","","2017"

"248",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Objectives: Our aim was to characterize the temporal changes in burden that Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) added to the hospital care of children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the United States. Methods: Retrospective analysis of annual, nationally representative samples of children and young adults with IBD. Results: There was a 5-fold increase in IBD hospitalizations with CDI from 1997 to 2011 (P for trend <0.01). During the same period, IBD hospitalizations without CDI increased 2-fold (P for trend <0.01). Mean length of stay for IBD hospitalizations with CDI was consistently longer than that for hospitalizations without CDI and did not significantly change over time (P for trend = 0.47). CDI-related total hospital days in the United States rose from 1702 to 10,194 days per million individuals per year from 1997 to 2011 (P for trend <0.01). Children and young adults hospitalized with CDI had a significantly lower odds of colectomy (0.31) compared with those without CDI. Total charges for CDI-related hospitalizations among children and young adults in the United States rose from $8.7 million in 1997 to $68.2 million in 2011. Conclusions: A widening gap in burden has opened between IBD hospitalizations with and without CDI during the last decade and a half. CDI-related hospitalizations are associated with disproportionately longer lengths of stay, more hospital days, and more charges than hospitalizations without CDI over time. Further work within health systems, hospitals, and practices can help us better understand this enlarging gap to improve clinical care for this vulnerable population.","","","","853f64e24ab25fcac66dbcf6f0ef317666fc45b0","","","","","","Disproportionate Rise in Clostridium difficile–Associated Hospitalizations Among US Youth With Inflammatory Bowel Disease, 1997–2011","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/853f64e24ab25fcac66dbcf6f0ef317666fc45b0","","2015"
"249",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Objectives: The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is a noninvasive disease activity index developed as a clinical trial endpoint. More recently, practice guidelines have recommended the use of PUCAI in routine clinical care. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and responsiveness of PUCAI in a large, diverse collection of pediatric gastroenterology practices. Methods: We extracted data from the 2 most recent encounters for patients with ulcerative colitis in the ImproveCareNow registry. Feasibility was determined by the percentage of patients for whom all PUCAI components were recorded, validity by correlation of PUCAI scores across physician global assessment (PGA) categories, and responsiveness to change by the correlation between the change in PUCAI and PGA scores between visits. Results: A total of 2503 patients were included (49.5% boys, age 15.2 ± 4.1 years, disease duration 3.7 ± 3.2 years). All items in the PUCAI were completed for 96% of visits. PUCAI demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability between remission, mild, and moderate disease; discrimination between moderate and severe disease was less robust. There was good correlation with PGA (r = 0.76 [P < 0.001] and weighted kappa &kgr; = 0.73 [P < 0.001]). The PUCAI change scores correlated well with PGA change scores (P < 0.001). Test–retest reliability of the PUCAI was good (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.70–0.75], P < 0.001). Guyatt responsiveness statistic was 1.18, and the correlation of &Dgr;PUCAI with &Dgr;PGA was 0.69 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The PUCAI is feasible to use in routine clinical settings. Evidence of its validity and responsiveness supports its use as a clinical tool for monitoring disease activity for patients with ulcerative colitis.","","","","8d711fc48953ba10c4e34ded3132af1a8107fb68","","","","","","Feasibility and Validity of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in Routine Clinical Practice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d711fc48953ba10c4e34ded3132af1a8107fb68","","2015"

We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that might serve as short term treatment targets. Design A chart review of 115 children with new onset UC was performed (age 11±4.1 years; 58 (50%) males; 86 (75%) extensive colitis; 70 (61%) moderate–severe disease; 63 (55%) received steroids at baseline). We assessed the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, and endoscopy at diagnosis. Results The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)). SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) children who had active disease (PUCAI ≥10) at 3 months (negative predictive value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score >10; (NPV=91%, positive predictive value=52%; p<0.001), implying that PUCAI >10 at 3 months has a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of ≤10. None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate/albumin/haemoglobin; all AUROC<0.6, p>0.05) but baseline PUCAI predicted subsequent acute severe colitis and the need for salvage medical therapy. Conclusions Completeness of the early response appears more important than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using PUCAI<10 as a feasible treatment goal. Our data suggest that treatment escalation should be considered with a PUCAI value of ≥10 at 3 months.","","","","32accf4277395a534a7592a59f1661d2d5909879","","","","","","Early endoscopic, laboratory and clinical predictors of poor disease course in paediatric ulcerative colitis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32accf4277395a534a7592a59f1661d2d5909879","","2014"

Areas covered: In accordance with a published protocol (PROSPERO no. CRD42019118838), we systematically and critically evaluated all published evidence on the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF-α in children with perianal CD, in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and clinicalTrials.gov databases until October, 18th, 2018. We included in our systematic review 29 articles yielding a total of 565 perianal CD patients aged between 9 months to 18 years. Expert opinion: According to low-quality evidence from small, uncontrolled and heterogeneous descriptive studies, and very few randomized controlled trial, nearly three-fifths children with perianal CD achieved remission with anti-TNF-α treatment and in approximately 40% remission was maintained after 12 months, with practically low discontinuation rate due to serious adverse events. More than half of the patients achieved complete fistula closure. There is still a need for more robust evidence adequately assessing the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF-α therapy in pediatric perianal CD, as well as in comparison with other therapies.","","","","67628730e79a7f2ff06799adb34e645b38766235","","","","","","Efficacy of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha therapy in paediatric Crohn’s disease patients with perianal lesions: a systematic review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67628730e79a7f2ff06799adb34e645b38766235","","2020"

The multisubband carrier dynamics as well as the polarization dynamics were taken into account. Carrier heating and coherent light-carrier interactions as well as the interplay of these nonlinear processes and the amplifier dispersion are studied. Strong Rabi oscillations occur in the optical field of a propagated pulse, its frequency chirp, as well as in the carrier density and temperature. While the Rabi oscillation imposes negative frequency chirp and hence red-shifts the pulse spectrum, positive frequency chirp can occur due to the local gain dispersion, where the higher frequency components of the pulse have larger gain. Due to the Rabi oscillation, the spectrum of the amplified pulse is considerably distorted and sidebands emerge. For a linearly chirped input pulse, the spectrum of the output pulse can be either red-shifted or blue-shifted with respect to its center frequency, depending on its initial chirp. For strong pulse propagation, a pronounced pulse break up occurs when a 175-fs pulse propagates in the gain regime, while a significant pulse compression occurs when the pulse propagates at the transparency point.","","","","32d9d424d9b3e6a3663ce29f1128582d482443cf","","","","","","Rabi oscillations for subpicosecond pulses in quantum-well optical amplifiers: interplay of carrier heating, nonlinear, and spectral effects","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32d9d424d9b3e6a3663ce29f1128582d482443cf","","2005"

N‐terminal microsequencing revealed sequence identity with a hypothetical polypeptide encoded by the yeast YGL037C open reading frame sharing 30% sequence identity with Escherichia coli pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase. A yeast strain in which the NAMase gene, hereafter named PNC1, was deleted shows a decreased intracellular NAD+ concentration, consistent with the loss of NAMase activity in the null mutant. In wild‐type strains, NAMase activity is stimulated during the stationary phase of growth, by various hyperosmotic shocks or by ethanol treatment. Using a PPNC1::lacZ gene fusion, we have shown that this stimulation of NAMase activity results from increased levels of the protein and requires stress response elements in the 5′ non‐coding region of PNC1. These results suggest that NAMase helps yeast cells to adapt to various stress conditions and nutrient depletion, most likely via the activation of NAD‐dependent biological processes.

"267",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite with wide-ranging and significant roles in the cell. Defects in NAD+ metabolism have been associated with many human disorders; it is therefore an emerging therapeutic target. Moreover, NAD+ metabolism is perturbed during colonization by a variety of pathogens, either due to the molecular mechanisms employed by these infectious agents or by the host immune response they trigger. Three main biosynthetic pathways, including the de novo and salvage pathways, contribute to the production of NAD+ with a high degree of conservation from bacteria to humans. De novo biosynthesis, which begins with l-tryptophan in eukaryotes, is also known as the kynurenine pathway. Intermediates of this pathway have various beneficial and deleterious effects on cellular health in different contexts. For example, dysregulation of this pathway is linked to neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. Activation of the de novo pathway is also implicated in various infections and inflammatory signaling. Given the dynamic flexibility and multiple roles of NAD+ intermediates, it is important to understand the interconnections and cross-regulations of NAD+ precursors and associated signaling pathways to understand how cells regulate NAD+ homeostasis in response to various growth conditions. Although regulation of NAD+ homeostasis remains incompletely understood, studies in the genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae may help provide some molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors contribute to the maintenance and regulation of cellular function and how they are regulated by various nutritional and stress signals. Here we present a brief overview of recent insights and discoveries made with respect to the relationship between NAD+ metabolism and selected human disorders and infections, with a particular focus on the de novo pathway. We also discuss how studies in budding yeast may help elucidate the regulation of NAD+ homeostasis.","","","","979f0a2f90ac3b5781d57694953f1bde25ba22f3","","","","","","NAD+ Metabolism, Metabolic Stress, and Infection","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/979f0a2f90ac3b5781d57694953f1bde25ba22f3","","2021"

"270",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Candida albicans is a pathogenic fungus that causes systemic infections and mortality in immunosuppressed individuals. We previously showed that deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 by Hst3 is essential for C. albicans viability. Hst3 is a fungal‐specific NAD+‐dependent protein deacetylase of the sirtuin family. In vivo, supraphysiological concentrations of nicotinamide (NAM) are required for Hst3 inhibition and cytotoxicity. This underscores the importance of identifying mechanisms by which C. albicans can modulate intracellular NAM concentrations. For the first time in a pathogenic fungus, we combine genetics, heavy isotope labeling, and targeted quantitative metabolomics to identify genes, pathways, and mechanisms by which C. albicans can reduce the cytotoxicity of high NAM concentrations. We discovered three distinct fates for supraphysiological NAM concentrations. First, upon transient exposure to NAM, high intracellular NAM concentrations rapidly return near the physiological levels observed in cells that are not exposed to NAM. Second, during the first step of a fungal‐specific NAM salvage pathway, NAM is converted into nicotinic acid, a metabolite that cannot inhibit the sirtuin Hst3. Third, we provide evidence that NAM enters the NAD+ metabolome through a NAM exchange reaction that contributes to NAM‐mediated inhibition of sirtuins. However, in contrast to the other fates of NAM, the NAM exchange reaction cannot cause a net decrease in the intracellular concentration of NAM. Therefore, this reaction cannot enhance resistance to NAM. In summary, we demonstrate that C. albicans possesses at least two mechanisms to attenuate the cytotoxicity of pharmacological NAM concentrations. It seems likely that those two mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic NAM concentrations are conserved in many other pathogenic fungi.","","","","6c3d842c3451f6f8fe9aff78e89ae33205b4d24f","","","","","","Mechanisms to reduce the cytotoxicity of pharmacological nicotinamide concentrations in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c3d842c3451f6f8fe9aff78e89ae33205b4d24f","","2020"
"271",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Sirtuin 6, SIRT6, is critical for both glucose and lipid homeostasis and is involved in maintaining genomic stability under conditions of oxidative DNA damage such as those observed in age-related diseases. There is an intense search for modulators of SIRT6 activity, however, not many specific activators have been reported. Long acyl-chain fatty acids have been shown to increase the weak in vitro deacetylase activity of SIRT6 but this effect is modest at best. Herein we report that electrophilic nitro-fatty acids (nitro-oleic acid and nitro-conjugated linoleic acid) potently activate SIRT6. Binding of the nitro-fatty acid to the hydrophobic crevice of the SIRT6 active site exerted a moderate activation (2-fold at 20 μm), similar to that previously reported for non-nitrated fatty acids. However, covalent Michael adduct formation with Cys-18, a residue present at the N terminus of SIRT6 but absent from other isoforms, induced a conformational change that resulted in a much stronger activation (40-fold at 20 μm). Molecular modeling of the resulting Michael adduct suggested stabilization of the co-substrate and acyl-binding loops as a possible additional mechanism of SIRT6 activation by the nitro-fatty acid. Importantly, treatment of cells with nitro-oleic acid promoted H3K9 deacetylation, whereas oleic acid had no effect. Altogether, our results show that nitrated fatty acids can be considered a valuable tool for specific SIRT6 activation, and that SIRT6 should be considered as a molecular target for in vivo actions of these anti-inflammatory nitro-lipids.","","","","48923667456cc46ef2b0a1ccb07f8fd1dc004e37","","","","","","Nitro-fatty acids as activators of hSIRT6 deacetylase activity","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48923667456cc46ef2b0a1ccb07f8fd1dc004e37","","2020"

"274",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation is a prerequisite to the transcriptional activation of NIC3 in response to ABA. DNA methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of DNA methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. DNA demethylation is a reverse process of DNA methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), active DNA demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from DNA. Here we showed that ros1 mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible genes were decreased in ros1 mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible genes are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation. Notable among them is NICOTINAMIDASE 3 (NIC3) that encodes an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD+ salvage pathway. Many enzymes in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The nic3 mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of NIC3 restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that NIC3 is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active DNA demethylation maintains the active state of NIC3 transcription in response to ABA.","","","","9a15f73d8d6c5eb192502070e60b7495d8523e19","","","","","","ROS1-Dependent DNA Demethylation Is Required for ABA-Inducible NIC3 Expression1[OPEN]","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a15f73d8d6c5eb192502070e60b7495d8523e19","","2019"
"275",":Paper","CC-BY","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite participating in cellular redox chemistry and signaling, and the complex regulation of NAD+ metabolism is not yet fully understood. To investigate this, we established a NAD+-intermediate specific reporter system to identify factors required for salvage of metabolically linked nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinic acid (NA). Mutants lacking components of the NatB complex, NAT3 and MDM20, appeared as hits in this screen. NatB is an Nα-terminal acetyltransferase responsible for acetylation of the N terminus of specific Met-retained peptides. In NatB mutants, increased NA/NAM levels were concomitant with decreased NAD+. We identified the vacuolar pool of nicotinamide riboside (NR) as the source of this increased NA/NAM. This NR pool is increased by nitrogen starvation, suggesting NAD+ and related metabolites may be trafficked to the vacuole for recycling. Supporting this, increased NA/NAM release in NatB mutants was abolished by deleting the autophagy protein ATG14. We next examined Tpm1 (tropomyosin), whose function is regulated by NatB-mediated acetylation, and Tpm1 overexpression (TPM1-oe) was shown to restore some NatB mutant defects. Interestingly, although TPM1-oe largely suppressed NA/NAM release in NatB mutants, it did not restore NAD+ levels. We showed that decreased nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nma1/Nma2) levels probably caused the NAD+ defects, and NMA1-oe was sufficient to restore NAD+. NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of Nma1 and Nma2 appears essential for maintaining NAD+ levels. In summary, our results support a connection between NatB-mediated protein acetylation and NAD+ homeostasis. Our findings may contribute to understanding the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism.","","","","d21b36577a7277b10146c0b023d41aafbec2086f","","","","","","A functional link between NAD+ homeostasis and N-terminal protein acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d21b36577a7277b10146c0b023d41aafbec2086f","","2018"

In order to increase the number of nicotinamidases described to date, this manuscript characterizes a nicotinamidase obtained from a metagenomic library fosmid clone (JFF054_F02) obtained from a geothermal water stream microbial mat community in a Japanese epithermal mine. The enzyme showed an optimum temperature of 90°C, making it the first hyperthermophilic bacterial nicotinamidase to be characterized, since the phylogenetic analysis of this fosmid clone placed it in a clade of uncultured geothermal bacteria. The enzyme, named as UbNic, not only showed an alkaline optimum pH, but also a biphasic pH dependence of its kcat, with a maximum at pH 9.5–10.0. The two pKa values obtained were 4.2 and 8.6 for pKes1 and pKes2, respectively. These results suggest a possible flexible catalytic mechanism for nicotinamidases, which reconciles the two previously proposed mechanisms. In addition, the enzyme showed a high catalytic efficiency, not only toward nicotinamide, but also toward other nicotinamide analogs. Its mutational analysis showed that a tryptophan (W83) is needed in one of the faces of the active site to maintain low Km values toward all the substrates tested. Furthermore, UbNic proved to contain a Fe2+ ion in its metal binding site, and was revealed to belong to a new nicotinamidase subgroup. All these characteristics, together with its high pH- and thermal stability, distinguish UbNic from previously described nicotinamidases, and suggest that a wide diversity of enzymes remains to be discovered in extreme environments.","","","","9f39ed42953124a071a5e9e812e2e2d70486d694","","","","","","Biochemical characterization of a new nicotinamidase from an unclassified bacterium thriving in a geothermal water stream microbial mat community","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f39ed42953124a071a5e9e812e2e2d70486d694","","2017"
"278",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","ABSTRACT NAD (NAD+) is a cofactor related to many cellular processes. This cofactor is known to be unstable, especially at high temperatures, where it chemically decomposes to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose. Bacteria, yeast, and higher organisms possess the salvage pathway for reconstructing NAD+ from these decomposition products; however, the importance of the salvage pathway for survival is not well elucidated, except for in pathogens lacking the NAD+de novo synthesis pathway. Herein, we report the importance of the NAD+ salvage pathway in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 at high temperatures. We identified the gene encoding nicotinamidase (TTHA0328), which catalyzes the first reaction of the NAD+ salvage pathway. This recombinant enzyme has a high catalytic activity against nicotinamide (Km of 17 μM, kcat of 50 s−1, kcat/Km of 3.0 × 103 s−1 · mM−1). Deletion of this gene abolished nicotinamide deamination activity in crude extracts of T. thermophilus and disrupted the NAD+ salvage pathway in T. thermophilus. Disruption of the salvage pathway led to the severe growth retardation at a higher temperature (80°C), owing to the drastic decrease in the intracellular concentrations of NAD+ and NADH. IMPORTANCE NAD+ and other nicotinamide cofactors are essential for cell metabolism. These molecules are unstable and decompose, even under the physiological conditions in most organisms. Thermophiles can survive at high temperatures where NAD+ decomposition is, in general, more rapid. This study emphasizes that NAD+ instability and its homeostasis can be one of the important factors for thermophile survival in extreme temperatures.","","","","64a61cc18c09dc0a2f58479cef0c6b943f42404f","","","","","","A Key Enzyme of the NAD+ Salvage Pathway in Thermus thermophilus: Characterization of Nicotinamidase and the Impact of Its Gene Deletion at High Temperatures","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64a61cc18c09dc0a2f58479cef0c6b943f42404f","","2017"

However, evidence linking dietary interventions with specific alterations in histone modifications that subsequently affect lifespan remains elusive. We show here that deletion of histone N‐alpha‐terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and loss of its associated H4 N‐terminal acetylation (N‐acH4) extend yeast replicative lifespan. Notably, nat4Δ‐induced longevity is epistatic to the effects of calorie restriction (CR). Consistent with this, (i) Nat4 expression is downregulated and the levels of N‐acH4 within chromatin are reduced upon CR, (ii) constitutive expression of Nat4 and maintenance of N‐acH4 levels reduces the extension of lifespan mediated by CR, and (iii) transcriptome analysis indicates that nat4Δ largely mimics the effects of CR, especially in the induction of stress‐response genes. We further show that nicotinamidase Pnc1, which is typically upregulated under CR, is required for nat4Δ‐mediated longevity. Collectively, these findings establish histone N‐acH4 as a regulator of cellular lifespan that links CR to increased stress resistance and longevity.","","","","51490a427e64edaa773b1f807ca47031661b024f","","","","","","Loss of Nat4 and its associated histone H4 N‐terminal acetylation mediates calorie restriction‐induced longevity","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51490a427e64edaa773b1f807ca47031661b024f","","2016"

NAD+ depletion may play a major role in the aging process at the cellular level by limiting (1) energy production, (2) DNA repair, and (3) genomic signaling. In this study, we hypothesize that it is not NAD+ as a cofactor in redox reactions and coenzyme in metabolic processes that has the ultimate role in aging, but rather the role of NAD+ in cellular signaling when used as substrate for sirtuins (SIRT1-7 in mammals) and PARPs [Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases]. Both sirtuins and PARPs influence many transcription factors and can affect gene expression. As a signaling molecule, NAD+ is consumed in the reaction donating ADP-ribose and releasing nicotinamide (NAM) as a by-product. It seems that aging at the cellular level is associated with a decline of NAD+ and that NAD+ restoration can reverse phenotypes of aging by inducing cellular repair and stress resistance. Adequate intracellular NAD+ concentrations may be an important longevity assurance factor, while lowered cellular NAD+ concentration may negatively influence the life span.","","","","1901b82bbb8510ceff59acbaf0568a673eb34641","","","","","","NAD+ as the Link Between Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Caloric Restriction, Exercise, DNA Repair, Longevity, and Health Span.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1901b82bbb8510ceff59acbaf0568a673eb34641","","2016"

Common fungistatic drugs, such as fluconazole, are less toxic for patients but have low efficacy for initial therapy of the disease. Effective therapy against the disease is provided by the fungicidal drug amphotericin B; however, due to its high toxicity and the difficulty in administering its intravenous formulation, it is imperative to find new therapies targeting the fungus. The antiparasitic drug bithionol has been recently identified as having potent fungicidal activity. In this study, we used a combined gene dosing and drug affinity responsive target stability (GD-DARTS) screen as well as protein modeling to identify a common drug binding site of bithionol within multiple NAD-dependent dehydrogenase drug targets. This combination genetic and proteomic method thus provides a powerful method for identifying novel fungicidal drug targets for further development. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcosis is a neglected fungal meningitis that causes approximately half a million deaths annually. The most effective antifungal agent, amphotericin B, was developed in the 1950s, and no effective medicine has been developed for this disease since that time. A key aspect of amphotericin B’s effectiveness is thought to be because of its ability to kill the fungus (fungicidal activity), rather than just stop or slow its growth. The present study utilized a recently identified fungicidal agent, bithionol, to identify potential fungicidal drug targets that can be used in developing modern fungicidal agents. A combined protein and genetic analysis approach was used to identify a class of enzymes, dehydrogenases, that the fungus uses to maintain homeostasis with regard to sugar nutrients. Similarities in the drug target site were found that resulted in simultaneous inhibition and killing of the fungus by bithionol.

In our previous study, we found that deletion of the AS87_01735 gene significantly decreased the bacterial virulence of R. anatipestifer strain Yb2 (mutant RA625). The AS87_01735 gene was predicted to encode a nicotinamidase (PncA), a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, which is an important reaction in the NAD+ salvage pathway. In this study, the AS87_01735 gene was expressed and identified as the PncA-encoding gene, using an enzymatic assay. Western blot analysis demonstrated that R. anatipestifer PncA was localized to the cytoplasm. The mutant strain RA625 (named Yb2ΔpncA in this study) showed a similar growth rate but decreased NAD+ quantities in both the exponential and stationary phases in tryptic soy broth culture, compared with the wild-type strain Yb2. In addition, Yb2ΔpncA-infected ducks showed much lower bacterial loads in their blood, and no visible histological changes were observed in the heart, liver, and spleen. Furthermore, Yb2ΔpncA immunization of ducks conferred effective protection against challenge with the virulent wild-type strain Yb2. Our results suggest that the R. anatipestifer AS87_01735 gene encodes PncA, which is an important virulence factor, and that the Yb2ΔpncA mutant can be used as a novel live vaccine candidate.

In this study, we identified and characterized the pncA-homologous gene AS87_01735 in R. anatipestifer strain Yb2. R. anatipestifer PncA is a cytoplasmic protein that possesses similar PncA activity, compared with other organisms. Generation of the pncA mutant Yb2ΔpncA led to a decrease in the NAD+ content, which was associated with decreased capacity for invasion and attenuated virulence in ducks. Furthermore, Yb2ΔpncA immunization of ducks conferred effective protection against challenge with the virulent wild-type strain Yb2.

Likewise, the removal of these marks often results in the consumption of a different metabolite. Therefore, these so-called epigenetic marks have the capacity to integrate the expression state of chromatin with the metabolic state of the cell.

"286",":Paper","CC-BY","Saccharomyces cerevisiae is calorie-restricted by lowering glucose from 2% to 0.5%. Under low glucose conditions, replicative lifespan is extended in a manner that depends on the NAD+-dependent protein lysine deacetylase Sir2 and NAD+ salvage enzymes. Because NAD+ is required for glucose utilization and Sir2 function, it was postulated that glucose levels alter the levels of NAD+ metabolites that tune Sir2 function. Though NAD+ precursor vitamins, which increase the levels of all NAD+ metabolites, can extend yeast replicative lifespan, glucose restriction does not significantly change the levels or ratios of intracellular NAD+ metabolites. To test whether glucose restriction affects protein copy numbers, we developed a technology that combines the measurement of Urh1 specific activity and quantification of relative expression between Urh1 and any other protein. The technology was applied to obtain the protein copy numbers of enzymes involved in NAD+ metabolism in rich and synthetic yeast media. Our data indicated that Sir2 and Pnc1, two enzymes that sequentially convert NAD+ to nicotinamide and then to nicotinic acid, are up-regulated by glucose restriction in rich media, and that Pnc1 alone is up-regulated in synthetic media while levels of all other enzymes are unchanged. These data suggest that production or export of nicotinic acid might be a connection between NAD+ and calorie restriction-mediated lifespan extension in yeast.","","","","50ac50815d873a352d7199aff213ad42f00892b5","","","","","","Quantification of Protein Copy Number in Yeast: The NAD+ Metabolome","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50ac50815d873a352d7199aff213ad42f00892b5","","2014"

The lack of enzymatic activity of Gas1 or treatment with a cell wall-damaging agent, Congo red, exhibits effects similar to those of the gas1Δ mutation.

In this paper, the catalytic mechanism of Pnc1 has been investigated by using a combined quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) approach based on the recently obtained crystal structure of Pnc1. The reaction pathway, the detail of each elementary step, the energetics of the whole catalytic cycle, and the roles of key residues and Zn-binding site are illuminated. Our calculation results indicate that the catalytic water molecule comes from the bulk solvent, which is then deprotonated by residue D8.

But unexpected complications in assays of SIRT1 activity have made it unclear whether compounds thought to be sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) are really direct regulators of the enzyme. Further exploration of these effects by Hubbard et al. (p. 1216; see the Perspective by Yuan and Marmorstein) revealed that interaction of SIRT1 with certain substrates allows activation of SIRT1 by STACs and identified critical amino acids in SIRT1 required for these effects. Mouse myoblasts reconstituted with SIRT1 mutated at this amino acid lost their responsiveness to STACs. An interaction of the deacetylase SIRT1 with its substrate offers a possible explanation for some effects on aging.

The SIRT1 deacetylase has drawn attention in this regard as a target for drug design. Yet controversy exists around the mechanism of sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs). We found that specific hydrophobic motifs found in SIRT1 substrates such as PGC-1α and FOXO3a facilitate SIRT1 activation by STACs. A single amino acid in SIRT1, Glu230, located in a structured N-terminal domain, was critical for activation by all previously reported STAC scaffolds and a new class of chemically distinct activators. In primary cells reconstituted with activation-defective SIRT1, the metabolic effects of STACs were blocked.

Results: INAM unexpectedly increased the intracellular NAD+ concentration when added to growth medium. Conclusion: INAM-induced increases in NAD+ concentration require significant contributions from the NAD+ and nicotinamide riboside salvage pathways. Significance: INAM appears to promote NAD+ homeostasis, which favors Sir2-dependent processes. Sirtuins are an evolutionarily conserved family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that function in the regulation of gene transcription, cellular metabolism, and aging. Their activity requires the maintenance of an adequate intracellular NAD+ concentration through the combined action of NAD+ biosynthesis and salvage pathways. Nicotinamide (NAM) is a key NAD+ precursor that is also a byproduct and feedback inhibitor of the deacetylation reaction. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nicotinamidase Pnc1 converts NAM to nicotinic acid (NA), which is then used as a substrate by the NAD+ salvage pathway enzyme NA phosphoribosyltransferase (Npt1). Isonicotinamide (INAM) is an isostere of NAM that stimulates yeast Sir2 deacetylase activity in vitro by alleviating the NAM inhibition. In this study, we determined that INAM stimulates Sir2 through an additional mechanism in vivo, which involves elevation of the intracellular NAD+ concentration. INAM enhanced normal silencing at the rDNA locus but only partially suppressed the silencing defects of an npt1Δ mutant. Yeast cells grown in media lacking NA had a short replicative life span, which was extended by INAM in a SIR2-dependent manner and correlated with increased NAD+. The INAM-induced increase in NAD+ was strongly dependent on Pnc1 and Npt1, suggesting that INAM increases flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway.

Nicotinamidases are absent in mammals but function in NAD(+) salvage in many bacteria, yeast, plants, protozoa, and metazoans. We have performed structural and kinetic investigations of the nicotinamidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pnc1). Steady-state product inhibitor analysis revealed an irreversible reaction in which ammonia is the first product released, followed by nicotinic acid. A series of nicotinamide analogues acting as inhibitors or substrates were examined, revealing that the nicotinamide carbonyl oxygen and ring nitrogen are critical for binding and reactivity. X-ray structural analysis revealed a covalent adduct between nicotinaldehyde and Cys167 of Pnc1 and coordination of the nicotinamide ring nitrogen to the active-site zinc ion. Using this structure as a guide, the function of several residues was probed via mutagenesis and primary (15)N and (13)C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on V/K for amide bond hydrolysis. The KIE values of almost all variants were increased, indicating that C-N bond cleavage is at least partially rate limiting; however, a decreased KIE for D51N was indicative of a stronger commitment to catalysis. In addition, KIE values using slower alternate substrates indicated that C-N bond cleavage is at least partially rate limiting with nicotinamide to highly rate limiting with thionicotinamide. A detailed mechanism involving nucleophilic attack of Cys167, followed by elimination of ammonia and then hydrolysis to liberate nicotinic acid, is discussed. These results will aid in the design of mechanism-based inhibitors to target pathogens that rely on nicotinamidase activity.","","","","a01089b2c1c7c2dc38b53fd7a3b736370857beb9","","","","","","Structural and kinetic isotope effect studies of nicotinamidase (Pnc1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a01089b2c1c7c2dc38b53fd7a3b736370857beb9","","2012"

In the present study, using the concept of EFMs (elementary flux modes), we established all of the potential routes in a network describing NAD(+) biosynthesis and degradation. All known biosynthetic pathways, which include de novo synthesis starting from tryptophan as well as the classical Preiss-Handler pathway and NAD(+) synthesis from other vitamin precursors, were detected as EFMs. Moreover, several EFMs were found that degrade NAD(+), represent futile cycles or have other functionalities.

Genomics‐based reconstruction of NAD+ metabolism revealed that Leishmania protozoan parasites are NAD+ auxotrophs. Consequently, these parasites require assimilating NAD+ precursors (nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide riboside) from their host environment to synthesize NAD+ by a salvage pathway. Nicotinamidase is a key enzyme of this salvage pathway that catalyses conversion of nicotinamide (NAm) to nicotinic acid (Na), and that is absent in higher eukaryotes. We present here the biochemical and functional characterizations of the Leishmania infantum nicotinamidase (LiPNC1). Generation of Lipnc1 null mutants leads to a decrease in NAD+ content, associated with a metabolic shutdown‐like phenotype with an extensive lag phase of growth. Both phenotypes could be rescued by an add‐back construct or by addition of exogenous Na. In addition, Lipnc1 null mutants were unable to establish a sustained infection in a murine experimental model. Altogether, these results illustrate that NAD+ homeostasis is a fundamental component of Leishmania biology and virulence, and that NAm constitutes its main NAD+ source in the mammalian host. The crystal structure of LiPNC1 we solved allows now the design of rational inhibitors against this new promising therapeutic target.","","","","94163b78257eeb4d802eb5dd2b920a4288750d2d","","","","","","The Leishmania nicotinamidase is essential for NAD+ production and parasite proliferation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94163b78257eeb4d802eb5dd2b920a4288750d2d","","2011"

Contrary to the in vivo importance of PncA, the current annotation for the pncA ORF suggests that the encoded protein may be inactive due to the absence of an N-terminal aspartic acid residue that is a conserved member of the catalytic triad of characterized PncA proteins. Herein, we have used genetic and biochemical strategies to determine the N-terminal sequence of B. burgdorferi PncA.

NAD+ biosynthesis is required for two different regimens that extend lifespan in yeast. NAD+ is synthesized from tryptophan and the three vitamin precursors of NAD+: nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside. Supplementation of yeast cells with NAD+ precursors increases intracellular NAD+ levels and extends replicative lifespan. Here we show that both nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid are not only vitamins but are also exported metabolites. We found that the deletion of the nicotinamide riboside transporter, Nrt1, leads to increased export of nicotinamide riboside. This discovery was exploited to engineer a strain to produce high levels of extracellular nicotinamide riboside, which was recovered in purified form. We further demonstrate that extracellular nicotinamide is readily converted to extracellular nicotinic acid in a manner that requires intracellular nicotinamidase activity. Like nicotinamide riboside, export of nicotinic acid is elevated by the deletion of the nicotinic acid transporter, Tna1. The data indicate that NAD+ metabolism has a critical extracellular element in the yeast system and suggest that cells regulate intracellular NAD+ metabolism by balancing import and export of NAD+ precursor vitamins.","","","","7b46a507249c0e41314734e2fc6a09978602caf6","","","","","","Nrt1 and Tna1-Independent Export of NAD+ Precursor Vitamins Promotes NAD+ Homeostasis and Allows Engineering of Vitamin Production","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b46a507249c0e41314734e2fc6a09978602caf6","","2011"

It was previously suggested that CR activates Sir2 by reducing the levels of Sir2 inhibitors, NADH, or nicotinamide. Whereas NADH reduction is associated with an increase in respiration, nicotinamide clearance is induced by the upregulation of PNC1. Here, we show that, consistent with the hormesis hypothesis, PNC1 is part of a transcriptional stress response module consisting of 39 genes that increases under various stresses. Under high CR (0.1% glucose), Pnc1 becomes activated and its levels increase. However, low CR (0.5% glucose) increases yeast life span without PNC1 induction or activation of any transcriptional stress response. Instead, microarray analysis of low CR shows that the messenger RNA levels of iron transport genes increase, suggesting that this mode of CR is regulated by a shift toward respiration and lowering NADH levels. Thus, at least two pathways regulate the CR response in yeast.","","","","a44e6bb3fbb411122826847f5a2de0436ede05d6","","","","","","Multiple pathways regulating the calorie restriction response in yeast.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a44e6bb3fbb411122826847f5a2de0436ede05d6","","2011"

Here we report that rapamycin treatment and nitrogen starvation, both of which cause inactivation of TOR complex 1 (TORC1), lead to enhanced association of Sir2 with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TORC1 inhibition increases transcriptional silencing of RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene integrated at the rDNA locus and reduces homologous recombination between rDNA repeats that causes formation of toxic extrachromosomal rDNA circles. In addition, TORC1 inhibition induces deacetylation of histones at rDNA. We also found that Pnc1 and Net1 are required for enhancement of association of Sir2 with rDNA under TORC1 inhibition.

These enzymes are widely distributed across biology, with examples found encoded in the genomes of Mycobacteria, Archaea, Eubacteria, Protozoa, yeast, and invertebrates, but there are none found in mammals. Although recent structural work has improved our understanding of these enzymes, their catalytic mechanism is still not well understood. Recent data show that nicotinamidases are required for the growth and virulence of several pathogenic microbes. The enzymes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans regulate life span in their respective organisms, consistent with proposed roles in the regulation of NAD(+) metabolism and organismal aging. In this work, the steady state kinetic parameters of nicotinamidase enzymes from C. elegans, Sa. cerevisiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (a pathogen responsible for human pneumonia), Borrelia burgdorferi (the pathogen that causes Lyme disease), and Plasmodium falciparum (responsible for most human malaria) are reported. Nicotinamidases are generally efficient catalysts with steady state k(cat) values typically exceeding 1 s(-1). The K(m) values for nicotinamide are low and in the range of 2 -110 μM. Nicotinaldehyde was determined to be a potent competitive inhibitor of these enzymes, binding in the low micromolar to low nanomolar range for all nicotinamidases tested. A variety of nicotinaldehyde derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors in kinetic assays. Inhibitions are consistent with reaction of the universally conserved catalytic Cys on each enzyme with the aldehyde carbonyl carbon to form a thiohemiacetal complex that is stabilized by a conserved oxyanion hole. The S. pneumoniae nicotinamidase can catalyze exchange of (18)O into the carboxy oxygens of nicotinic acid with H(2)(18)O. The collected data, along with kinetic analysis of several mutants, allowed us to propose a catalytic mechanism that explains nicotinamidase and nicotinic acid (18)O exchange chemistry for the S. pneumoniae enzyme involving key catalytic residues, a catalytic transition metal ion, and the intermediacy of a thioester intermediate.","","","","80801cca6e8a64652a8d071f16917675ae0f8af4","","","","","","Characterization of nicotinamidases: steady state kinetic parameters, classwide inhibition by nicotinaldehydes, and catalytic mechanism.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80801cca6e8a64652a8d071f16917675ae0f8af4","","2010"

We have determined that multiple thiamine (THI) genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also regulated by the intracellular NAD+ concentration via the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hst1 and, to a lesser extent, Sir2. Both of these HDACs associate with a distal region of the affected THI gene promoters that does not overlap with a previously defined enhancer region bound by the thiamine-responsive Thi2/Thi3/Pdc2 transcriptional activators. The specificity of histone H3 and/or H4 deacetylation carried out by Hst1 and Sir2 at the distal promoter region depends on the THI gene being tested. Hst1/Sir2-mediated repression of the THI genes occurs at the level of basal expression, thus representing the first set of transcription factors shown to actively repress this gene class. Importantly, lowering the NAD+ concentration and inhibiting the Hst1/Sum1 HDAC complex elevated the intracellular thiamine concentration due to increased thiamine biosynthesis and transport, implicating NAD+ in the control of thiamine homeostasis.","","","","4ae0c9f1f2883ab36b604986640203e8d47815cc","","","","","","Thiamine Biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Is Regulated by the NAD+-Dependent Histone Deacetylase Hst1","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ae0c9f1f2883ab36b604986640203e8d47815cc","","2010"

In fact, the actions of NAD(+) have been extended from being an oxidoreductase cofactor for single enzymatic activities to acting as substrate for a wide range of proteins. These include NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and transcription factors that affect a large array of cellular functions. Through these effects, NAD(+) provides a direct link between the cellular redox status and the control of signaling and transcriptional events. Of particular interest within the metabolic/endocrine arena are the recent results, which indicate that the regulation of these NAD(+)-dependent pathways may have a major contribution to oxidative metabolism and life span extension. In this review, we will provide an integrated view on: 1) the pathways that control NAD(+) production and cycling, as well as its cellular compartmentalization; 2) the signaling and transcriptional pathways controlled by NAD(+); and 3) novel data that show how modulation of NAD(+)-producing and -consuming pathways have a major physiological impact and hold promise for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disease.","","","","9cd58396ccaf5e3a8a18073ea5fd15480b636b91","","","","","","The secret life of NAD+: an old metabolite controlling new metabolic signaling pathways.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cd58396ccaf5e3a8a18073ea5fd15480b636b91","","2010"

Significantly, localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is dependent on the metabolic status of cells and the phosphorylation of aminoacyl residues adjacent to the targeting signal. Exposure of cells to osmotic stress induces changes in the subcellular distribution of Gpd1p to the cytosol and nucleus. This behavior is similar to Pnc1p, which is coordinately expressed with Gpd1p, and under conditions of cell stress changes its subcellular distribution from peroxisomes to the nucleus where it mediates chromatin silencing. Although peroxisomes are necessary for the β-oxidation of fatty acids in yeast, the localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is not. Rather, shifts in the distribution of Gpd1p to different cellular compartments in response to changing cellular status suggests a role for Gpd1p in the spatial regulation of redox potential, a process critical to cell survival, especially under the complex stress conditions expected to occur in the wild.","","","","91f2d2c01023557040784a23e2ffe6cc7cdcd713","","","","","","Dynamic Changes in the Subcellular Distribution of Gpd1p in Response to Cell Stress*","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91f2d2c01023557040784a23e2ffe6cc7cdcd713","","2009"

However, the biological role of endogenous NmR remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that salvaging endogenous NmR is an integral part of NAD+ metabolism. A balanced NmR salvage cycle is essential for calorie restriction-induced life span extension and stress resistance in yeast. Our results also suggest that partitioning of the pyridine nucleotide flux between the classical salvage cycle and the NmR salvage branch might be modulated by the NAD+-dependent Sir2 deacetylase. Furthermore, two novel deamidation steps leading to nicotinic acid mononucleotide and nicotinic acid riboside production are also uncovered that further underscore the complexity and flexibility of NAD+ metabolism. In addition, utilization of extracellular nicotinamide mononucleotide requires prior conversion to NmR mediated by a periplasmic phosphatase Pho5.

Remarkably, mRNA mistranslation plays critical roles in the evolution of the genetic code, can be beneficial under stress conditions in yeast and in Escherichia coli and is an important source of peptides for MHC class I complex in dendritic cells. Despite this, its biology has been overlooked over the years due to technical difficulties in its detection and quantification. In order to shed new light on the biological relevance of mistranslation we have generated codon misreading in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using drugs and tRNA engineering methodologies. Surprisingly, such mistranslation up-regulated the longevity gene PNC1. Similar results were also obtained in cells grown in the presence of amino acid analogues that promote protein misfolding. The overall data showed that PNC1 is a biomarker of mRNA mistranslation and protein misfolding and that PNC1-GFP fusions can be used to monitor these two important biological phenomena in vivo in an easy manner, thus opening new avenues to understand their biological relevance.","","","","6f3edebaf36b4fa3252db72590c0a872c112d2f4","","","","","","The Yeast PNC1 Longevity Gene Is Up-Regulated by mRNA Mistranslation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f3edebaf36b4fa3252db72590c0a872c112d2f4","","2009"

"322",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","The histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p is dependent on NAD+ and inhibited by nicotinamide (NAM). As a result, Sir2p-regulated processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae such as silencing and replicative aging are susceptible to alterations in cellular NAD+ and NAM levels. We have determined that high concentrations of NAM in the growth medium elevate the intracellular NAD+ concentration through a mechanism that is partially dependent on NPT1, an important gene in the Preiss–Handler NAD+ salvage pathway. Overexpression of the nicotinamidase, Pnc1p, prevents inhibition of Sir2p by the excess NAM while maintaining the elevated NAD+ concentration. This growth condition alters the epigenetics of rDNA silencing, such that repression of a URA3 reporter gene located at the rDNA induces growth on media that either lacks uracil or contains 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), an unusual dual phenotype that is reminiscent of telomeric silencing (TPE) of URA3. Despite the similarities to TPE, the modified rDNA silencing phenotype does not require the SIR complex. Instead, it retains key characteristics of typical rDNA silencing, including RENT and Pol I dependence, as well as a requirement for the Preiss–Handler NAD+ salvage pathway. Exogenous nicotinamide can therefore have negative or positive impacts on rDNA silencing, depending on the PNC1 expression level.","","","","3f634e0ccd37bfebcec293c8dbd03b7b4afa3a87","","","","","","Pnc1p-Mediated Nicotinamide Clearance Modifies the Epigenetic Properties of rDNA Silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f634e0ccd37bfebcec293c8dbd03b7b4afa3a87","","2008"

Nicotinamide riboside is a recently discovered eukaryotic NAD+ precursor converted to NAD+ via the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway and by nucleosidase activity and nicotinamide salvage. Nicotinamide riboside supplementation of yeast extends replicative life span on high glucose medium. The molecular basis for nicotinamide riboside uptake was unknown in any eukaryote. Here, we show that deletion of a single gene, YOR071C, abrogates nicotinamide riboside uptake without altering nicotinic acid or nicotinamide import. The gene, which is negatively regulated by Sum1, Hst1, and Rfm1, fully restores nicotinamide riboside import and utilization when resupplied to mutant yeast cells. The encoded polypeptide, Nrt1, is a predicted deca-spanning membrane protein related to the thiamine transporter, which functions as a pH-dependent facilitator with a Km for nicotinamide riboside of 22 μm.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CR has been proposed to extend lifespan by boosting the activity of sirtuin deacetylases, thereby suppressing the formation of toxic repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) circles. An alternative theory is that CR works by suppressing the TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, which extends lifespan via mechanisms that are unknown but thought to be independent of sirtuins. Here we show that TOR inhibition extends lifespan by the same mechanism as CR: by increasing Sir2p activity and stabilizing the rDNA locus. Further, we show that rDNA stabilization and lifespan extension by both CR and TOR signaling is due to the relocalization of the transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they increase expression of the nicotinamidase gene PNC1. These findings suggest that TOR and sirtuins may be part of the same longevity pathway in higher organisms, and that they may promote genomic stability during aging.","","","","4bf061481ffed75d03f1ccbd75a4edcf38e36976","","","","","","MSN2 and MSN4 Link Calorie Restriction and TOR to Sirtuin-Mediated Lifespan Extension in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bf061481ffed75d03f1ccbd75a4edcf38e36976","","2007"

We have identified an Arabidopsis gene, NIC2, that is expressed at relatively high levels in mature seed, and encodes a nicotinamidase enzyme with homology to yeast and bacterial nicotinamidases. Seed of a knockout mutant, nic2-1, had reduced nicotinamidase activity, retarded germination and impaired germination potential. nic2-1 germination was restored by after-ripening or moist chilling, but remained hypersensitive to application of nicotinamide or ABA. Nicotinamide is a known inhibitor of NAD-degrading poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP enzymes) that are implicated in DNA repair. We found reduced poly(ADP)ribosylation levels in nic2-1 seed, which were restored by moist chilling. Furthermore, nic2-1 seed had elevated levels of NAD, and germination was hypersensitive to methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), suggesting that PARP activity and DNA repair responses were impaired. We suggest that nicotinamide is normally metabolized by NIC2 during moist chilling or after-ripening, which relieves inhibition of PARP activity and allows DNA repair to occur prior to germination.","","","","661be36bca2e99b45a295b9b7916c5f94d3fac33","","","","","","Nicotinamidase activity is important for germination.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/661be36bca2e99b45a295b9b7916c5f94d3fac33","","2007"

Recently, NAD biochemistry has also been implicated in a broader range of biological functions in mammals, but the regulation of NAD biosynthesis has been poorly investigated. Recent progress in the field of NAD biochemistry has fueled new interest in the NAD biosynthetic pathways from its precursors and their physiological roles in metabolism. This review summarizes the latest knowledge on the NAD biosynthetic pathways and focuses on one of the key NAD biosynthetic enzymes, namely, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Recent findingsMammals predominantly use nicotinamide rather than nicotinic acid as a precursor for NAD biosynthesis. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is the rate-limiting enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide in the NAD biosynthetic pathway from nicotinamide in mammals. The same protein has also been identified as a cytokine (pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor or PBEF) or an insulin-mimetic hormone (visfatin). SummaryWe propose that the presumed multiple effects of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin may be entirely explained by its role as an intra and extracellular NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We also propose a new model of Namp/PBEF/visfatin-mediated systemic NAD biosynthesis and its possible physiological significance. Our model provides an important insight into developing preventive/therapeutic interventions for metabolic complications, such as obesity and diabetes.","","","","78a9094511c420715bc4d5edfd073863ad0511ed","","","","","","The regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis by Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in mammals","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78a9094511c420715bc4d5edfd073863ad0511ed","","2007"

A combination of de novo and salvage pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of NAD in all organisms. The pathways and enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway in yeast and animals, which diverge at nicotinamide, have been extensively studied. Yeast cells convert nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, while mammals lack the enzyme nicotinamidase and instead convert nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana gene At2g22570 encodes a nicotinamidase, which is expressed in all tissues, with the highest levels observed in roots and stems. The 244-residue protein, designated AtNIC1, converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid and has a Km value of 118 +/- 17 microM and a Kcat value of 0.93 +/- 0.13 sec(-1). Plants homozygous for a null AtNIC1 allele, nic1-1, have lower levels of NAD and NADP under normal growth conditions, indicating that AtNIC1 participates in a yeast-type NAD salvage pathway. Mutant plants also exhibit hypersensitivity to treatments of abscisic acid and NaCl, which is correlated with their inability to increase the cellular levels of NAD(H) under these growth conditions, as occurs in wild-type plants. We also show that the growth of the roots of wild-type but not nic1-1 mutant plants is inhibited and distorted by nicotinamide.","","","","f73893c5681b0eb0dd5ef81cb5b8e18832758218","","","","","","Nicotinamidase participates in the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f73893c5681b0eb0dd5ef81cb5b8e18832758218","","2007"

We have isolated several mutated forms that fail to confer resistance to cycloheximide and itraconazole. Here, we examined two variants, the expression of which was abnormally low when cells reach the stationary phase of growth. The Pdr51157 variant lacked the C‐terminal transmembrane domain due to the presence of a nonsense mutation at codon 1158. The second variant, Pdr5L183P, contained a Leu183Pro substitution close to the Walker A motif in the N‐terminal nucleotide‐binding domain. This substitution impaired UTPase activity as well as protein stability. The Pdr5L183P variant induced the unfolded protein response and was targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the highly unstable Pdr5L183P was mislocalized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐associated compartments, whereas the truncated Pdr51157 protein was retained in the ER. When threonine 363 (located in the first nucleotide‐binding domain, close to the Walker B motif) in Pdr5L183P was replaced with isoleucine, this double mutant conferred partial drug resistance.

Respiratory-deficient and oxidative damage-sensitive defects in pos5 mutants were not made more deleterious by yef1 deletion, and a quantitative growth phenotype of pos5 and its arginine auxotrophy were repaired by plasmid-borne POS5 but not UTR1 or ADH1-driven YEF1. utr1 haploids have a slow growth phenotype on glucose not exacerbated by yef1 deletion but reversed by either plasmid-borne UTR1 or ADH1-driven YEF1. The defect in fermentative growth of utr1 mutants renders POS5 but not POS5-dependent mitochondrial genome maintenance essential because rho–utr1 derivatives are viable. Purified Yef1 has similar nucleoside triphosphate specificity but substantially lower specific activity and less discrimination in favor of NAD versus NADH phosphorylation than Utr1. Low expression and low intrinsic NAD kinase activity of Yef1 and the lack of phenotype associated with yef1 suggest that Utr1 and Pos5 are responsible for essentially all NAD/NADH kinase activity in vivo. The data are compatible with a model in which there is no exchange of NADP, NADPH, or cytoplasmic NAD/NADH kinase between nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments, but the cytoplasm is exposed to mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase during the transit of the molecule.","","","","d9b16957f920efd6df29f0c25451a70f130761b9","","","","","","Synthetic Lethal and Biochemical Analyses of NAD and NADH Kinases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Establish Separation of Cellular Functions*","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9b16957f920efd6df29f0c25451a70f130761b9","","2006"

In this study, we determined the kinetics of the NAD biosynthesis mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), and we examined its effects on the transcriptional regulatory function of the mouse Sir2 ortholog, Sir2α, in mouse fibroblasts. We found that Nampt was the ratelimiting component in this mammalian NAD biosynthesis pathway. Increased dosage of Nampt, but not Nmnat, increased the total cellular NAD level and enhanced the transcriptional regulatory activity of the catalytic domain of Sir2α recruited onto a reporter gene in mouse fibroblasts.

Recent years have seen an increase in the number of signalling and gene regulatory processes where NAD+ or NADP+ are metabolised. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) are metabolites of NAD+ and NADP+ , respectively, and now have widely accepted roles as potent intracellular calcium releasing agents in animals, but are less well characterised in plants. NAD kinases catalyse the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to form NADP and are well characterised in plants in their requirement for the calcium binding protein calmodulin, thereby putatively linking their regulation to stress-induced intracellular calcium release. A second group of proteins unrelated to those above, the sirtuins (Sir2) and poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), cleave NAD and transfer the ADP-ribose group to acetyl groups and proteins, respectively.

The Sirtuins are phylogenetically conserved in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and Archeal species. Prokaryotic and Archeal species usually have one or two Sirtuin homologs, whereas eukaryotes typically have multiple versions. The founding member of this protein family is the Sir2 histone deacetylase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is absolutely required for transcriptional silencing in this organism. Sirtuins in other organisms often have nonhistone substrates and in eukaryotes, are not always localized in the nucleus. The diversity of substrates is reflected in the various biological activities that Sirtuins function, including development, metabolism, apoptosis, and heterochromatin formation. This review emphasizes the great diversity in Sirtuin function and highlights its unusual catalytic properties.","","","","a6043d5c89ca00fe7eb3241e9416a4c8ccb4b732","","","","","","Diversity in the Sir2 family of protein deacetylases","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6043d5c89ca00fe7eb3241e9416a4c8ccb4b732","","2004"

"348",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","ABSTRACT The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 protein is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) that functions in transcriptional silencing and longevity. The NAD+ salvage pathway protein, Npt1, regulates Sir2-mediated processes by maintaining a sufficiently high intracellular NAD+ concentration. However, another NAD+ salvage pathway component, Pnc1, modulates silencing independently of the NAD+ concentration. Nicotinamide (NAM) is a by-product of the Sir2 deacetylase reaction and is a natural Sir2 inhibitor. Pnc1 is a nicotinamidase that converts NAM to nicotinic acid. Here we show that recombinant Pnc1 stimulates Sir2 HDAC activity in vitro by preventing the accumulation of NAM produced by Sir2. In vivo, telomeric, rDNA, and HM silencing are differentially sensitive to inhibition by NAM. Furthermore, PNC1 overexpression suppresses the inhibitory effect of exogenously added NAM on silencing, life span, and Hst1-mediated transcriptional repression. Finally, we show that stress suppresses the inhibitory effect of NAM through the induction of PNC1 expression. Pnc1, therefore, positively regulates Sir2-mediated silencing and longevity by preventing the accumulation of intracellular NAM during times of stress.","","","","1aa94ba349075b192f11bc9a50bd49548f67eeef","","","","","","Nicotinamide Clearance by Pnc1 Directly Regulates Sir2-Mediated Silencing and Longevity","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1aa94ba349075b192f11bc9a50bd49548f67eeef","","2004"

"350",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","SUMMARY When it was first proposed that the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae might serve as a model for human aging in 1959, the suggestion was met with considerable skepticism. Although yeast had proved a valuable model for understanding basic cellular processes in humans, it was difficult to accept that such a simple unicellular organism could provide information about human aging, one of the most complex of biological phenomena. While it is true that causes of aging are likely to be multifarious, there is a growing realization that all eukaryotes possess surprisingly conserved longevity pathways that govern the pace of aging. This realization has come, in part, from studies of S. cerevisiae, which has emerged as a highly informative and respected model for the study of life span regulation. Genomic instability has been identified as a major cause of aging, and over a dozen longevity genes have now been identified that suppress it. Here we present the key discoveries in the yeast-aging field, regarding both the replicative and chronological measures of life span in this organism. We discuss the implications of these findings not only for mammalian longevity but also for other key aspects of cell biology, including cell survival, the relationship between chromatin structure and genome stability, and the effect of internal and external environments on cellular defense pathways. We focus on the regulation of replicative life span, since recent findings have shed considerable light on the mechanisms controlling this process. We also present the specific methods used to study aging and longevity regulation in S. cerevisiae.","","","","50add9ed68ab0e46b7cc13a40acd8667ea376821","","","","","","Longevity Regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Linking Metabolism, Genome Stability, and Heterochromatin","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50add9ed68ab0e46b7cc13a40acd8667ea376821","","2003"
"351",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","NAD+, an essential molecule involved in a variety of cellular processes, is synthesized through de novo and salvage pathways. NAD+ synthetase catalyses the final step in both pathways. Here we show that this enzyme is encoded by the QNS1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis NAD+ synthetases was able to suppress the lethality of a qns1 deletion, while a B. subtilis NAD+ synthetase mutant with lowered catalytic activity was not. Overexpression of QNS1 tagged with HA led to elevated levels of NAD+ synthetase activity in yeast extracts, and this activity can be recovered by immunoprecipitation using anti‐HA antibody. An allele of QNS1 was constructed that carries a point mutation predicted to reduce the catalytic activity. Overexpression of this allele, qns1G521E, failed to elevate NAD+ synthetase levels and qns1G521E could not rescue the lethality caused by the depletion of Qns1p. These results demonstrate that NAD+ synthetase activity is essential for cell viability. A GFP‐tagged version of Qns1p displayed a diffuse localization in both the nucleus and the cytosol. Finally, the rat homologue of QNS1 was cloned and shown to functionally replace yeast QNS1, indicating that NAD+ synthetase is functionally conserved from bacteria to yeast and mammals.

"352",":Paper","CC-BY","In addition to its well-known role as a coenzyme in oxidation-reduction reactions, the distinct role of NAD as a precursor for molecules involved in cell regulation has been clearly established. The involvement of NAD in these regulatory processes is based on its ability to function as a donor of ADP-ribose; NAD synthesis is therefore required to avoid depletion of the intracellular pool. The rising interest in the biosynthetic routes leading to NAD formation and the highly conserved nature of the enzymes involved prompted us to reconstruct the NAD biosynthetic routes operating in distinct eukaryotic organisms. The evidence obtained from biochemical and computational analysis provides a good example of how complex metabolic pathways may evolve. In particular, it is proposed that the development of several NAD biosynthetic routes during evolution has led to partial functional redundancy, allowing a given pathway to freely acquire novel functions unrelated to NAD biosynthesis.","","","","f7b2826d5a73b7522a94b3bac42ffc08ccd4c2bb","","","","","","Reconstructing eukaryotic NAD metabolism.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7b2826d5a73b7522a94b3bac42ffc08ccd4c2bb","","2003"

"356",":Paper","CC-BY","The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 protein is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing, genome stability, and longevity. A human homologue of Sir2, SIRT1, regulates the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits apoptosis. The Sir2 deacetylation reaction generates two products:O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, a precursor of nicotinic acid and a form of niacin/vitamin B3. We show here that nicotinamide strongly inhibits yeast silencing, increases rDNA recombination, and shortens replicative life span to that of asir2 mutant. Nicotinamide abolishes silencing and leads to an eventual delocalization of Sir2 even in G1-arrested cells, demonstrating that silent heterochromatin requires continual Sir2 activity. We show that physiological concentrations of nicotinamide noncompetitively inhibit both Sir2 and SIRT1 in vitro. The degree of inhibition by nicotinamide (IC50< 50 μm) is equal to or better than the most effective known synthetic inhibitors of this class of proteins. We propose a model whereby nicotinamide inhibits deacetylation by binding to a conserved pocket adjacent to NAD+, thereby blocking NAD+ hydrolysis. We discuss the possibility that nicotinamide is a physiologically relevant regulator of Sir2 enzymes.","","","","a900c08686eb55b9dc077ddfc3e311e68e11d5ec","","","","","","Inhibition of Silencing and Accelerated Aging by Nicotinamide, a Putative Negative Regulator of Yeast Sir2 and Human SIRT1*","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a900c08686eb55b9dc077ddfc3e311e68e11d5ec","","2002"

Here we show that increased dosage of NPT1, encoding a nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase critical for the NAD+ salvage pathway, increases Sir2-dependent silencing, stabilizes the rDNA locus, and extends yeast replicative life span by up to 60%. Both NPT1 and SIR2provide resistance against heat shock, demonstrating that these genes act in a more general manner to promote cell survival. We show that Npt1 and a previously uncharacterized salvage pathway enzyme, Nma2, are both concentrated in the nucleus, indicating that a significant amount of NAD+ is regenerated in this organelle. Additional copies of the salvage pathway genes, PNC1, NMA1, andNMA2, increase telomeric and rDNA silencing, implying that multiple steps affect the rate of the pathway. AlthoughSIR2-dependent processes are enhanced by additional NPT1, steady-state NAD+ levels and NAD+/NADH ratios remain unaltered. This finding suggests that yeast life span extension may be facilitated by an increase in the availability of NAD+ to Sir2, although not through a simple increase in steady-state levels. We propose a model in which increased flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway is responsible for the Sir2-dependent extension of life span.","","","","8589755fd3d57f5ee7e4aaa434f7a2c64d017991","","","","","","Manipulation of a Nuclear NAD+ Salvage Pathway Delays Aging without Altering Steady-state NAD+ Levels*","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8589755fd3d57f5ee7e4aaa434f7a2c64d017991","","2002"

The interpretation of experiments has been limited by difficulty in identifying individual rate constants. In order to invert the kinetic data, and to gain information about the individual reacting sites, we introduce a Laplace inversion technique and obtain the distribution function of rate constants by which the intricate reaction proceeds. A series of carefully overlapped experiments were performed on lysozyme at 25°C, an exchange profile obtained, and a distribution function extracted. This function was composed of a product of two terms, indicating two parallel pathways. The first, a power‐law term, was attributed to exchange from the native state. This part of the distribution function thus describes the scope of the conformational fluctuations in proteins at constant temperature and pressure. The second, an exponential, was seen to be associated with the pathway involving thermal unfolding and subsequent free exchange with the solvent. The influence of trichlorethanol and glycerol on the total distribution function was measured. Trichloroethanol selectively increased the contribution from the thermal unfolding pathway, whereas glycerol, besides decreasing this type of contribution, increased the width of the distribution function attributed to structural fluctuations.","","","","006400fc1d0daeb7ea8ef7b1d3fc7a9b907a8d01","","","","","","Fluctuations of protein structure as expressed in the distribution of hydrogen exchange rate constants","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006400fc1d0daeb7ea8ef7b1d3fc7a9b907a8d01","","1980"

The activation of these compounds, including some arylamine drugs, involves N-hydroxylation, usually by cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450) in Family 1 (1A2, 1A1, and 1B1). We previously demonstrated that the bioactivation product of the anticancer agent 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F 203), an N-hydroxylamine, can be reduced by P450 2S1 to its amine precursor under anaerobic conditions and, to a lesser extent, under aerobic conditions [Wang, K., and Guengerich, F.

In the study presented here, we tested the hypothesis that P450 2S1 is involved in the reductive biotransformation of known carcinogenic aromatic amines and HAAs. The N-hydroxylamines of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) were synthesized and found to be reduced by P450 2S1 under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The formation of amines due to P450 2S1 reduction also occurred under aerobic conditions but was less apparent because the competitive disproportionation reactions (of the N-hydroxylamines) also yielded amines. Further, some nitroso and nitro derivatives of the arylamines could also be reduced by P450 2S1. None of the amines tested were oxidized by P450 2S1. These results suggest that P450 2S1 may be involved in the reductive detoxication of several of the activated products of carcinogenic aromatic amines and HAAs.","","","","065471b8132ea20d4f7e90ee546c44f785c2c1cb","","","","","","Reduction of aromatic and heterocyclic aromatic N-hydroxylamines by human cytochrome P450 2S1.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/065471b8132ea20d4f7e90ee546c44f785c2c1cb","","2013"

Conclusion: MOSC2 and CYB5B are essential components of the mitochondrial amidoxime reductase, and MOSC2 is important for lipogenesis. Significance: We suggest a role of MOSC2 in adipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and as a potential novel drug target. Reduction of hydroxylamines and amidoximes is important for drug activation and detoxification of aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Such a reductase system was previously found to be of high activity in adipose tissue and liver, and furthermore, in vitro studies using recombinant truncated and purified enzymes suggested the participation of cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R), cytochrome b5 (CYB5), and molybdenum cofactor sulfurase C-terminal containing 1 and 2 (MOSC1 and -2). Here, we show that purified rat liver outer mitochondrial membrane contains high amidoxime reductase activity and that MOSC2 is exclusively localized to these membranes. Moreover, using the same membrane fraction, we could show direct binding of a radiolabeled benzamidoxime substrate to MOSC2. Following differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 cells into mature adipocytes, the MOSC2 levels as well as the amidoxime reductase activity were increased, indicating that the enzyme is highly regulated under lipogenic conditions. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of MOSC2 and the mitochondrial form of cytochrome b5 type B (CYB5B) significantly inhibited the reductase activity in the differentiated adipocytes, whereas down-regulation of MOSC1, cytochrome b5 type A (CYB5A), CYB5R1, CYB5R2, or CYB5R3 had no effect. Down-regulation of MOSC2 caused impaired lipid synthesis. These results demonstrate for the first time the direct involvement of MOSC2 and CYB5B in the amidoxime reductase activity in an intact cell system.

One responsible enzyme system, the microsomal benzamidoxime reductase, consisting of cytochrome b5, its reductase, and a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme, was isolated from pig liver microsomes (J Biol Chem 272:19615–19620). Further investigations followed to establish whether such enzyme systems are also present in microsomes of other organs such as brain, lung, and intestine.

The reductase activities were measured by following the reduction of benzamidoxime to benzamidine, guanoxabenz to guanabenz, and Ro 48-3656 ([[1-[(2S)-2-[[4-[(hydroxyamino)iminomethyl]benzoyl]amino]-1-oxopropyl]-4-piperidinyl]oxy]-acetic acid) to Ro 44-3888 ([[1-[(2S)-2-[[4-(aminoiminomethyl)benzoyl]amino]-1-oxopropyl]-4-piperidinyl]oxy]-acetic acid).

The importance of extrahepatic metabolism in the reduction of N-hydroxylated prodrugs is demonstrated.","","","","fa010806013e836dff6bf0434da73acf59c79f14","","","","","","HEPATIC, EXTRAHEPATIC, MICROSOMAL, AND MITOCHONDRIAL ACTIVATION OF THE N-HYDROXYLATED PRODRUGS BENZAMIDOXIME, GUANOXABENZ, AND RO 48-3656 ([[1-[(2S)-2-[[4-[(HYDROXYAMINO)IMINOMETHYL]BENZOYL]AMINO]-1-OXOPROPYL]-4-PIPERIDINYL]OXY]-ACETIC ACID)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa010806013e836dff6bf0434da73acf59c79f14","","2005"
"368",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","The enzymic basis for intracellular reduction of N-hydroxylated amidines to their corresponding amidines, and hydroxylamines to their corresponding amines, is unknown. The hydroxylated amidines can be used as prodrug moieties, and an understanding of the enzyme system active in the reduction can contribute to more efficient drug development. In this study, we examined the properties of this enzyme system using benzamidoxime and N-hydroxymelagatran as substrates. In rats and humans, the hepatic enzyme system was localized in mitochondria as well as in microsomes, using preferably NADH as cofactor. Potassium cyanide, N-methylhydroxylamine, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and desferrioxamine were efficient inhibitors, whereas typical cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibitors were ineffective. In rats, the highest specific activity was found in liver, adipose tissue, and kidneys, whereas in humans, the specific activity in the preparations of adipose tissue examined was lower. A sex difference was observed in rat liver, where 4-fold higher activity was seen in microsomes from female rats. No gender differences were present in any other tissue investigated. Partial purification of the hepatic system was achieved using polyethylene glycol fractionation followed by Octyl Sepharose chromatography at low detergent concentrations, whereas the enzyme was denatured after complete solubilization. The unique appearance of the enzyme activity in adipose tissue, together with the cyanide sensitivity and the failure of typical P450 inhibitors to impede the reaction, indicates that the enzyme system active in reduction of benzamidoxime and N-hydroxymelagatran formation is not of cytochrome P450 origin, but likely consists of an NADH-dependent electron transfer chain with a cyanide-sensitive protein as the terminal component.","","","","e0014fc7029e9667293ba8bb6edd88777265365d","","","","","","CHARACTERIZATION AND PARTIAL PURIFICATION OF THE RAT AND HUMAN ENZYME SYSTEMS ACTIVE IN THE REDUCTION OF N-HYDROXYMELAGATRAN AND BENZAMIDOXIME","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0014fc7029e9667293ba8bb6edd88777265365d","","2005"

The 00‐rapeseed meal (00‐RSM) is the developed variety of rapeseed with reduced GLS and erucic acid content through genetic selection. The present study was conducted with the objective of comparing the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in 00‐RSM and RSM when fed to growing broilers. Three samples of each ingredient were collected from different sources. Two hundred and fifty two day‐old male broilers (Hubbard × Hubbard) were fed a corn‐soybean meal based starter diet in crumble form from day 1 to 13. On day 14, all chicks were individually weighed and randomly distributed to 42 replicate pens (6 birds in each pen). Six test diets (2 ingredient × 3 samples) with approximately 20% crude protein were made in mash form in such a way that the 6 test ingredients served as the sole source of AA in one diet. The endogenous AAs (EAA) were determined by feeding a nitrogen‐free diet to six replicate pens. Each test diet was fed to six replicates of broiler chicks from 14 to 21 days of age. Results indicated that the SID of all AA differed (P < 0.001) among 00‐RSM samples. Among RSM samples, the SID of AA varied for arginine, methionine (P < 0.01), histidine, leucine, lysine, aspartic acid, and phenylalanine (P < 0.05). A greater (P < 0.05) SID of all AA except arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, cysteine, and glutamic acid was observed in 00‐RSM compared with RSM. In conclusion, 00‐RSM had greater SID of AA compared with RSM and it is nutritionally superior to RSM to be used in broiler diets.","","","","08034ea4bf385311fa9b6b19c8ba5866712c892c","","","","","","Comparative ileal digestibility of amino acids in 00‐rapeseed meal and rapeseed meal fed to growing male broilers","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08034ea4bf385311fa9b6b19c8ba5866712c892c","","2017"

The experimental diets contain either soybean meal (SBM) or canola meal (CM) with 3 levels (100, 110, and 120% of NRC recommendation) of d-Thr. During the course of the trial (0 to 35 D), interactions (P < 0.05) between PS and d-Thr were observed for feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass, and gut health parameters. The broilers fed recommended level (100%) of d-Thr had 7 and 5% poorer FCR compared with those fed diets with 110 and 120% d-Thr, respectively.

"378",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Summary Broiler chicken production is expected to increase significantly in the next decades to satisfy the poultry meat demand of a growing world population. In this scenario, one of the most important challenges for the poultry industry is to enhance bird productivity while remaining economically and environmentally sustainable. Feeding represents the major cost in raising of broiler chickens and has important implications for environmental impact, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, improving broiler capacity in converting ingested feed into body growth, which is generally referred to as feed efficiency (often expressed through the feed conversion ratio), is fundamental to promoting a sustainable intensification of poultry production. In this review, we highlight the importance of feed efficiency improvements in terms of overall sustainability for the broiler chicken production chain. Furthermore, the potential of feed additive-based nutritional strategies, such as the dietary administration of crystalline amino acids, proteases, phytases and organic minerals, is critically discussed in the light of their role in supporting the sustainable intensification of this crucial livestock sector.","","","","8e188005418d389640276f1779a30148fb407c8b","","","","","","Importance of feed efficiency for sustainable intensification of chicken meat production: implications and role for amino acids, feed enzymes and organic trace minerals","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e188005418d389640276f1779a30148fb407c8b","","2021"

The electrophysiologic study demonstrated the presence of four atrio-ventricular accessory pathways with antegrade conduction (left lateral, right posteroseptal, right midseptal and right posterolateral). After ablation of the fourth accessory pathway, the electrocardiogram showed a persistent delta wave with a short HV interval. Atrial stimulation demonstrated decremental conduction, progressive lengthening of the AH interval and no modification in the HV interval nor in the preexcitation pattern, suggestive of the presence of a fasciculo-ventricular fiber.

Methods to solve these estimation problems need to take the specific properties of data and models into account. The aim of this review is to give an overview on the state of the art in estimation methods for heterogeneous cell population data and models. The focus is on models based on the population balance equation, but stochastic and individual-based models are also discussed. It starts with a brief discussion of common experimental approaches and types of measurement data that can be obtained in this context.

Based on these results, we show that with common models of intracellular dynamics, the cell population is coordinated in the sense that all cells converge close to a common equilibrium point. We then study a more specific example of coupled cells which behave as bistable switches, where the intracellular dynamics are such that cells may be in one of two equilibrium points. Here, we find that the whole population is bistable in the sense that it converges to a population state where either all cells are close to the one equilibrium point, or all cells are close to the other equilibrium point.

Accurately measuring the precision of noisy oscillators and the heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity across a population of cells requires single-cell recordings of sufficient length to fully represent the variability of oscillations. We found persistent, independent circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in 6-week-long bioluminescence recordings of 80 primary fibroblast cells dissociated from PER2::LUC mice and kept in vitro for 6 months. Due to the stochastic nature of rhythmicity, the proportion of cells appearing rhythmic increases with the length of interval examined, with 100% of cells found to be rhythmic when using 3-week windows. Mean period and amplitude are remarkably stable throughout the 6-week recordings, with precision improving over time. For individual cells, precision of period and amplitude are correlated with cell size and rhythm amplitude, but not with period, and period exhibits much less cycle-to-cycle variability (CV 7.3%) than does amplitude (CV 37%). The time series are long enough to distinguish stochastic fluctuations within each cell from differences among cells, and we conclude that the cells do exhibit significant heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity, which we measure using a novel statistical metric. Furthermore, stochastic modeling suggests that these single-cell clocks operate near a Hopf bifurcation, such that intrinsic noise enhances the oscillations by minimizing period variability and sustaining amplitude.","","","","3855e764ba0d8c4172bcf39823a8f84faa115fbd","","","","","","Persistent Cell-Autonomous Circadian Oscillations in Fibroblasts Revealed by Six-Week Single-Cell Imaging of PER2::LUC Bioluminescence","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3855e764ba0d8c4172bcf39823a8f84faa115fbd","","2012"

"391",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Background and Objective: Reproterol is a monomolecular combination of orciprenaline and theophylline used as β-adrenergic agonist to induce bronchodilation in bronchial asthma. Since the mechanism of action of reproterol has not been investigated so far, its potential anti-inflammatory activity in asthma remains still unknown. Therefore, we have studied in vitro whether the theophylline component of the reproterol molecule might enhance the stimulatory effect of the β-adrenoceptor on cAMP production resulting in suppression of inflammatory mediator production. Methods: The effects of reproterol, orciprenaline and theophylline (10–9–10–5 M) on spontaneous cAMP (5 × 104 cells/30 min)- and on LPS (10 μg/ml)-stimulated LTB4 production (105 cells/4 h) were determined in normal monocytes in vitro. Results: Production of cAMP (n = 9) was significantly augmented in a dose-dependent manner by orciprenaline (30 ± 8%) and theophylline (28 ± 10%), but mostly by reproterol (127 ± 8%) at 10–5 M. Despite incubation with propranolol, significant stimulation of cAMP production was notable following reproterol therapy. Production of LTB4 was significantly inhibited by reproterol (–48 ± 14%) and less by theophylline (–28 ± 10%), but was stimulated by orciprenaline (+20 ± 8%) at 10–5 M. Conclusion: We conclude that reproterol exerts a strong stimulatory effect on monocyte cAMP production and a suppressive effect on LTB4 production possibly due to a synergistic mode of action on adenylate cyclase activity and inhibition of phosphodiesterases. More clinical studies in bronchial asthma will be needed to determine whether these results may translate into clinically relevant effects.","","","","fa640ba8c21c415a9d05a135bde1bd5c27ce2ffc","","","","","","Reproterol – A Monomolecular Combination of Orciprenaline and Theophylline: Novel Aspects of Its Mode of Action in Asthma","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa640ba8c21c415a9d05a135bde1bd5c27ce2ffc","","1999"

The cell-permeable cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP, xanthine-based KMUP-1 and KMUP-3, and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor zaprinast all inhibited TNF-α-induced increases of iNOS expression and NO levels and reversed TNF-α-induced decreases of sGCα1, sGCβ1, and PKG expression. These results imply that cGMP enhancers could have anti-proinflammatory potential in TSMCs. TNF-α also increased protein kinase A (PKA) expression and cAMP levels, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and activated productions of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-PGF1α (stable PGI2 metabolite). Dexamethasone and N-[2-(cyclohexyloxyl)-4-nitrophenyl]-methane sulfonamide (NS-398; a selective COX-2 inhibitor) attenuated TNF-α-induced expression of COX-2 and activated productions PGE2 and PGI2. However, KMUP-1 and KMUP-3 did not affect COX-2 activities and did not further enhance cAMP levels in the presence of TNF-α. It is suggested that TNF-α-induced increases of PKA expression and cAMP levels are mediated by releasing PGE2 and PGI2, the activation products of COX-2. In conclusion, xanthine-based KMUP-1 and KMUP-3 inhibit TNF-α-induced expression of iNOS in TSMCs, involving the sGC/cGMP/PKG expression pathway but without the involvement of COX-2.","","","","8de21e041bb7e06c5ba45646199d62041387dc1c","","","","","","Inhibition of Proinflammatory Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Inducible Nitric-Oxide Synthase by Xanthine-Based 7-[2-[4-(2-Chlorobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3-dimethylxanthine (KMUP-1) and 7-[2-[4-(4-Nitrobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1, 3-dimethylxanthine (KMUP-3) in Rat Trachea: The Involvement of S","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8de21e041bb7e06c5ba45646199d62041387dc1c","","2006"

Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists have several effects on airway function, most of which are mediated in a variety of cell types resulting in increased c-AMP-production and inhibition of inflammatory mediator production. However, their stimulating effects on cAMP-production became known to be inversed by increasing phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and degradation of cAMP. Therefore, in this study we have evaluated the efficacy of reproterol, a dual acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist and PDE-inhibitor, as compared to salbutamol and fenoterol with respect to production of cAMP and LTB4 in cultured monocytes.


METHODS
Isolated human monocytes (10(5)/ml) were incubated (n = 9) in suspension with beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (10(-10) -10(-4) M) for 30 minutes with and without IBMX. Then, cAMP production was determined following treatment with Triton-X100. Production of LTB4 was measured following incubation of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for 4 hrs in the presence of LPS (10 mg/ml). cAMP and LTB subset 4 were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme immunoassay.


RESULTS
At 10(-5) M, production of cAMP was significantly stimulated by reproterol > fenoterol > salbutamol in a dose-dependent manner to an extent of *128%, *65%, 13% (*p<0.04) respectively. In contrast, LTB4-production was inhibited significantly to a similar degree by salbutamol and reproterol in a dose-dependent manner by 59% and 49% (10(-5) M, p<0.03), respectively, with decreasing inhibition (15%) after fenoterol. Following co-incubation with IBMX, cAMP production only increased significantly (p<0.002) after fenoterol (+110%) compared to salbutamol (+29%) and reproterol (+50%) (ANOVA, p<0.001).


CONCLUSION
These data suggest effects of the theophylline constituent of reproterol to inhibit adenylyl cyclase induced phosphodiesterase activity. The advantageous synergistic effects of reproterol on cAMP-production need to be further explored in trials.","","","","ef220e827972e9b1253a007977644ccf9c0c8d45","","","","","","Different mechanisms of action of beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists: a comparison of reproterol, fenoterol and salbutamol on monocyte cyclic-AMP and leukotriene B4 production in vitro.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef220e827972e9b1253a007977644ccf9c0c8d45","","2004"

While more and more scientific research of bioelectromagnetic phenomena is focusing on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses, characterization of those effects is far from complete. In this paper, a synthesis of experimental studies from the point of computational modeling is presented. The complexity of the experiments requires a numerical rather than an analytical approach. Solving Maxwell’s equations using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a necessary step in visualizing and understanding broadband response. The advantages of this method include having almost no limits in the description of geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated material, numerical robustness, and appropriateness for the computer technology of today. Some of the results of the computation and their importance in future experimental design are discussed. Improvements in the computational modeling and dielectric material description are suggested. This paper aims at justifying a scientific basis for UWB exposure safety standards relevant for setting the non-ionizing UWB radiation exposure guidelines.

HP/UWB pulses typically have durations on the order of nanoseconds, rise times of picoseconds and amplitudes around 100 kV m−1. This article reviews current research on biological effects from HP/UWB exposure. The different references were classified according to endpoints (cardiovascular system, central nervous system, behavior, genotoxicity, teratology …). The article also reviews the aspects of mechanisms of interactions and tissue damage as well as the numerical work that has been done for studying HP/UWB pulse propagation and pulse energy deposition inside biological tissues. The mechanisms proposed are the molecular conformation change, the modification of chemical reaction rates, membrane excitation and breakdown and direct electrical forces on cells or cell constituents, and the energy deposition. As regards the penetration of biological matter and the deposited energy, mainly computations were published. They have shown that the EM field inside the biological matter is strongly modified compared to the incident EM field and that the energy absorption for HP/UWB pulses occurs in the same way as for continuous waves. However, the energy carried by a HP/UWB pulse is very low and the deposited energy is low. The number of published studies dealing with the biological effects is small and only a few pointed out slight effects. It should be further noted that the animal populations used in the studies were not always large, the statistical analyses not always relevant and the teams involved in this research rather limited in number.","","","","d6a95310a61f32ea7f7d8b7d40a9f38e0447affe","","","","","","Penetration and propagation into biological matter and biological effects of high-power ultra-wideband pulses: a review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6a95310a61f32ea7f7d8b7d40a9f38e0447affe","","2016"

The knowledge of the biological effects of this type of radiation is crucial for the protection of the staffs involved in UWB system development but also within the framework of their future uses. As no exposure standard exists, the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis has initiated a research program in this area. This program was constituted firstly by a bibliographical survey on the damage mechanisms, the dosimetry and the biological effects. At the sight of the results, it has been considered necessary to measure HPM/UWB pulse propagation in tissue-mimicking phantom materials as mainly numerical works were done on this topic. Indeed the question of the electromagnetic field amplitude in biological tissues and of the loss of energy along its propagation is crucial for the determination of damage mechanisms that can be expected. In this purpose, D-dot probes were used to measure the electric displacement field and set into materials that possess the dispersive dielectric properties of human soft tissues over the microwave frequency range, from 100 MHz to 3 GHz. Cubes of phantom materials containing D-dot were exposed to HPM/UWB pulses which have the following characteristics: a sub-nanosecond rise time, an electric field amplitude of 350 kV m-1 and a pulse duration of 3 ns. This paper will present the results of the bibliographical survey and of these experiments. Additionally, at our best knowledge, no studies dealing with the impact of HPM/UWB pulses on Active Implementable Medical Devices (AIMDs) were published. Consequently, this aspect has also been examined. Implementable Cardiac Pacemaker (ICP) was selected as AIMD since it is the most frequently implemented and it has to maintain vital functions. A bibliographic study was done to determine the in vitro experimental protocol. This latter was based, in particular, on the work performed to establish standards for the exposure of people bearing AIMDs to electromagnetic fields, on studies in the context of EMP simulator and also on studies achieved for UHF frequency range. The effects of HPM/UWB pulses on an ICP were investigated and both synchronous and asynchronous pacing modes were tested. The experimental results will also be presented.","","","","8e779b9b0ef3bd10d2367169d5213bff60eff513","","","","","","Biological and sanitary effects of high power microwave ultra wide band (HPM/UWB) signals","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e779b9b0ef3bd10d2367169d5213bff60eff513","","2013"

Although there is substantial prior literature on the biological effects of UWB pulses on both cells and animals, an explicit, unequivocal and definite pattern of the corresponding biological responses remains elusive, and the systemic secondary consequences are also still not fully understood. In this study, we found that exposing mice to UWB pulses resulted in the alteration of several biochemical blood parameters, which further prompted us to investigate changes in the liver and kidneys of mice exposed to UWB pulses with different field intensities and different durations. The data demonstrated that exposure to UWB pulses significantly increased the levels of ALT and AST, increased oxidative stress, and could even induce the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. The total number of pulses under the tested acute exposure regiment contributed most to the observed hepatic and rental dysfunction. Notably, the physiological and molecular changes recovered approximately 72 hours after exposure. These results imply the potential risk of acute exposure to UWB pulses, and highlight the meaningful targets for further long-term study of chronic exposure.","","","","390ffd3cebdda95bac61581b7a953797cc9b3fd0","","","","","","Effects of acute exposure to ultra-wideband pulsed electromagnetic fields on the liver and kidneys of mice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/390ffd3cebdda95bac61581b7a953797cc9b3fd0","","2020"

This work aims to assess health hazards of high-power microwaves and helps define hazard threshold levels of modulated radiofrequency exposures such as those emitted by the first generations of mobile phones. Rats were exposed to the highest possible field levels, under single acute or repetitive exposures for eight weeks. Intense microwave electric fields at 1 MV/m of nanoseconds duration were applied from two sources at different carrier frequencies of 10 and 3.7 GHz. The repetition rate was 100 pps, and the duration of train pulses lasted from 10 s to twice 8 min. The effects were studied on the central nervous system, by labelling brain inflammation marker GFAP and by performing different behavioural tests: rotarod, T-maze, beam-walking, open-field, and avoidance test. Long-time survival was measured in animals repeatedly exposed, and anatomopathological analysis was performed on animals sacrificed at two years of life or at death if earlier. One group was sham exposed. Few effects were observed on behaviour. With acute exposure, an avoidance reflex was shown at very high, thermal level (22 W/kg); GFAP was increased some days after exposure. Most importantly, with repeated exposures, survival time was 4-month shorter in the exposed group, with eleven animals exhibiting a large sub-cutaneous tumour, compared to two in the sham group. A residual X-ray exposure was also present in the beam (0.8 Gy), which is not a bias for the observed result. High power microwaves below thermal level in average, can increase cancer incidence and decrease survival time in rats, without clear effects on behaviour. The parameters of this effect need to be explored further, and a more precise dosimetry to be performed.","","","","b320dfa723ea319bba41530e956fae616f40c01d","","","","","","Repeated exposure to nanosecond high power pulsed microwaves increases cancer incidence in rat","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b320dfa723ea319bba41530e956fae616f40c01d","","2019"

The implantable sensor comprised transplant sensors with two electrodes, a wireless power transmission system, and a monitoring system. The sensor was inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal area and operated for 1 h/day for 5 days using a wireless power system. Importantly, the sensor was encapsulated by subcutaneous tissue and induced angiogenesis, inflammation, and phagocytosis.

In this research, the absorbed power in a worker honey bee and the influence of the bee’s presence on antennas’ radiation performance are investigated for the newly used frequencies in 5G networks from 6 to 240 GHz. To these aims, numerical simulations using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method were performed, in which a bee model, obtained by micro-CT scanning, was employed. These simulations showed that, in the near field, the absorbed power can increase by a factor of 53 from 6 to 240 GHz. This is a factor of 7 higher than the increase reported in the far-field in previous studies. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that antennas’ radiation efficiency can decrease by up to −40% when a bee appears in the near field. Likewise, it was found that the gain pattern depends on the separation distance between the bee and the antenna with a stronger dependency for higher frequencies.","","","","cff7cddb8516987a40ae46f3b7a29f33de32d642","","","","","","Near Field Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Field Exposure of a Western Honey Bee","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cff7cddb8516987a40ae46f3b7a29f33de32d642","","2021"

The behavior of compact metasurfaces is modeled with a composite right-left handed transmission line (CRLH TL). By controlling the dispersion curve, the resonant modes of the compact metasurface can be tuned efficiently. A printed coplanar waveguide (CPW) monopole antenna is used as the feed structure to excite the compact metasurface, which will result in a low profile antenna with low backward radiation. Following this approach, two compact antennas are designed for wearable applications. The first antenna is designed to operate at its first negative mode (−1 mode), which can realize miniaturization, but maintain the broadside radiation as for a normal microstrip antenna. The proposed prototype resonates around 2.65 GHz, with a matching bandwidth of 300 MHz. The total dimensions of the antenna are 39.4 × 33.4 mm2 (0.1 λ02), and its maximum gain is 2.99 dBi.

"412",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Objective: In this paper, we introduce global Maxwell tomography (GMT), a novel volumetric technique that estimates electric conductivity and permittivity by solving an inverse scattering problem based on magnetic resonance measurements. Methods: GMT relies on a fast volume integral equation solver, MARIE, for the forward path, and a novel regularization method, match regularization, designed specifically for electrical property estimation from noisy measurements. We performed simulations with three different tissue-mimicking numerical phantoms of different complexity, using synthetic transmit sensitivity maps with realistic noise levels as the measurements. We performed an experiment at 7 T using an eight-channel coil and a uniform phantom. Results: We showed that GMT could estimate relative permittivity and conductivity from noisy magnetic resonance measurements with an average error as low as 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, over the entire volume of the numerical phantom. Voxel resolution did not affect GMT performance and is currently limited only by the memory of the graphics processing unit. In the experiment, GMT could estimate electrical properties within 5% of the values measured with a dielectric probe. Conclusion: This work demonstrated the feasibility of GMT with match regularization, suggesting that it could be effective for accurate in vivo electrical property estimation. GMT does not rely on any symmetry assumption for the electromagnetic field, and can be generalized to estimate also the spin magnetization, at the expense of increased computational complexity. Significance: GMT could provide insight into the distribution of electromagnetic fields inside the body, which represents one of the key ongoing challenges for various diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","","","","bec56822794dd5b878301ba3db1f84c723813536","","","","","","Noninvasive Estimation of Electrical Properties From Magnetic Resonance Measurements via Global Maxwell Tomography and Match Regularization","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bec56822794dd5b878301ba3db1f84c723813536","","2020"

Recently, computational human models generated from medical images have often been used for such assessment, especially to consider the inter-subject variability. However, a common procedure to develop personalized models is time consuming because it involves excessive segmentation of several components that represent different biological tissues, which is a major obstacle in the inter-subject variability assessment of radiation safety. Deep learning methods have been shown to be a powerful approach for pattern recognition and signal analysis. Convolutional neural networks with deep architecture are proven robust for feature extraction and image mapping in several biomedical applications. In this study, we develop a learning-based approach for fast and accurate estimation of the dielectric properties and density of tissues directly from magnetic resonance images in a single shot. The smooth distribution of the dielectric properties in head models, which is realized using a process without tissue segmentation, improves the smoothness of the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution compared with that in the commonly used procedure. The estimated SAR distributions, as well as that averaged over 10 g of tissue in a cubic shape, are found to be highly consistent with those computed using the conventional methods that employ segmentation.","","","","14057ee94522c8b6e7fdae60d1dc3a3086897979","","","","","","Learning-based estimation of dielectric properties and tissue density in head models for personalized radio-frequency dosimetry","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14057ee94522c8b6e7fdae60d1dc3a3086897979","","2019"

In the study, we investigated the applicability of an efficient whole-body individual modelling method for the assessment of MRI RF exposure. The individual modelling method included a deformable human model and tissue simplification techniques. Besides its remarkable efficiency, this approach utilized only a low specific absorption rate (SAR) sequence or even no MRI scan to generate the whole-body individual model. Therefore, it substantially reduced the risk of RF exposure. The dosimetric difference of the individual modelling method was evaluated using the manually segmented human models. In addition, stochastic dosimetry using a surrogate model by polynomial chaos presented SAR variability due to body misalignment and tilt in the coil, which were frequently occurred in the practical scan. In conclusion, the dosimetric equivalence of the individual models was validated by both deterministic and stochastic dosimetry. The proposed individual modelling method allowed the physicians to quantify the patient-specific SAR while the statistical results enabled them to comprehensively weigh over the exposure risk and get the benefit of imaging enhancement by using the high-intensity scanners or the high-SAR sequences.","","","","b599af6462814e33074986785dcc3009e7d6586f","","","","","","Statistical Evaluation of Radiofrequency Exposure during Magnetic Resonant Imaging: Application of Whole-Body Individual Human Model and Body Motion in the Coil","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b599af6462814e33074986785dcc3009e7d6586f","","2019"

"417",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Numerical artifacts affect the reliability of computational dosimetry of human exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields. In the guidelines of the International Commission of Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, a reduction factor of 3 was considered to take into account numerical uncertainties when determining the limit values for human exposure. However, the rationale for this value is unsure. The IEEE International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety has published a research agenda to resolve numerical uncertainties in low-frequency dosimetry. For this purpose, intercomparison of results computed using different methods by different research groups is important. In previous intercomparison studies for low-frequency exposures, only a few computational methods were used, and the computational scenario was limited to a uniform magnetic field exposure. This study presents an application of various numerical techniques used: different finite-element method (FEM) schemes, method of moments, and boundary-element method (BEM) variants, and, finally, by using a hybrid FEM/BEM approach. As a computational example, the induced electric field in the brain by the coil used in transcranial magnetic stimulation is investigated. Intercomparison of the computational results is presented qualitatively. Some remarks are given for the effectiveness and limitations of application of the various computational methods.","","","","adb2a92e84fcc15f7ff2da6089a19eac1bac6570","","","","","","On the Use of Conformal Models and Methods in Dosimetry for Nonuniform Field Exposure","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/adb2a92e84fcc15f7ff2da6089a19eac1bac6570","","2018"

Method: The ICVSIE is a system of integral equations in terms of volume and surface equivalent currents in biological tissue subject to fields produced by externally or internally positioned devices. The system is created by using equivalence principles and solved numerically; the resulting current values are used to evaluate scattered and total electric fields, specific absorption rates, and related quantities.  Results: The validity, applicability, and efficiency of the ICVSIE are demonstrated by EM analysis of transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic resonance imaging, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation.  Conclusion: Unlike previous integral equations, the ICVSIE is stable regardless of the electric permittivities of the tissue or frequency of operation, providing an application-agnostic computational framework for EM-biomedical analysis.

Phantom heads are routinely used for radiofrequency dosimetry simulations, and the purpose of this study was to construct averaged phantom heads for children and young adults. Using magnetic resonance images (MRI), sectioned cadaver images, and a hybrid approach, we initially built template phantoms representing 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-year-old children and young adults. Our subsequent approach revised the template phantoms using 29 averaged items that were identified by averaging the MRI data from 500 children and young adults. In females, the brain size and cranium thickness peaked in the early teens and then decreased. This is contrary to what was observed in males, where brain size and cranium thicknesses either plateaued or grew continuously. The overall shape of brains was spherical in children and became ellipsoidal by adulthood. In this study, we devised a method to build averaged phantom heads by constructing surface and voxel models. The surface model could be used for phantom manipulation, whereas the voxel model could be used for compliance test of specific absorption rate (SAR) for users of mobile phones or other electronic devices.","","","","74d3afe2ac8832c3e01dc289e72de6e4d4125927","","","","","","Averaged head phantoms from magnetic resonance images of Korean children and young adults","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74d3afe2ac8832c3e01dc289e72de6e4d4125927","","2018"

The main field magnet is designed to exacting specifications but challenges in manufacturing, installation, and use require additional tools to maintain target operational performance. The gradient magnetic fields, which provide the primary signal localization mechanism, are designed under another set of complex design trade‐offs which include conflicting imaging performance specifications and patient physiology.

The radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields, which are used to elicit the signals fundamental to the MR image, are a challenge to optimize for a host of reasons that include patient safety, image quality, cost optimization, and secondary signal localization capabilities.

"426",":Paper","CC-BY","BACKGROUND
Human voxel models incorporating detailed anatomical features are vital tools for the computational evaluation of electromagnetic (EM) fields within the body. Besides whole-body human voxel models, phantoms representing smaller heterogeneous anatomical features are often employed; for example, localized breast voxel models incorporating fatty and fibroglandular tissues have been developed for a variety of EM applications including mammography simulation and dosimetry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultra-wideband microwave imaging. However, considering wavelength effects, electromagnetic modeling of the breast at sub-microwave frequencies necessitates detailed breast phantoms in conjunction with whole-body voxel models.


METHODS
Heterogeneous breast phantoms are sized to fit within radiofrequency coil hardware, modified by voxel-wise extrusion, and fused to whole-body models using voxel-wise, tissue-dependent logical operators. To illustrate the utility of this method, finite-difference time-domain simulations are performed using a whole-body model integrated with a variety of available breast phantoms spanning the standard four tissue density classifications representing the majority of the population.


RESULTS
The software library uses a combination of voxel operations to seamlessly size, modify, and fuse eleven breast phantoms to whole-body voxel models. The software is publicly available on GitHub and is linked to the file exchange at MATLAB® Central. Simulations confirm the proportions of fatty and fibroglandular tissues in breast phantoms have significant yet predictable implications on projected power deposition in tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
Breast phantoms may be modified and fused to whole-body voxel models using the software presented in this work; user considerations for the open-source software and resultant phantoms are discussed. Furthermore, results indicate simulating breast models as predominantly fatty tissue can considerably underestimate the potential for tissue heating in women with substantial fibroglandular tissue.","","","","e2e432f885d9e522242dc26532709a70c1fc4263","","","","","","Automated modification and fusion of voxel models to construct body phantoms with heterogeneous breast tissue: Application to MRI simulations.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2e432f885d9e522242dc26532709a70c1fc4263","","2017"

Materials and methods: COMSOL Multiphysics® version 4.4 (Stockholm, Sweden), which is based on finite element methods (FEM), was used to design and simulate monopole and dual slot with sleeve antennas. Power, specific absorption rate (SAR), temperature and necrosis distributions in the selected tissues were determined using these antennas. Monopole and dual slot with sleeve antennas were designed, simulated, constructed and applied in this study based on a semi-rigid coaxial cable. Ex vivo experiments were performed on liver, lung, muscle and heart of bovine obtained from a public animal slaughter house. The microwave energy was delivered using a 2.45 GHz solid-state microwave generator at 40 W for 3, 5 and 10 min. Aspect ratio, ablation length and ablation diameter were also determined on ablated tissues and compared with simulated results. Student’s t-test was used to compare the statistically significant difference between the performance of the two antennas. Results: The dual slot antenna with sleeve produces localised microwave energy better than the monopole antenna in all ablated tissues using simulation and experimental validation methods. There were significant differences in ablation diameter and aspect ratio between the sleeve antenna and monopole antenna. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the simulation and experimental results. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the dual slot antenna with sleeve produced larger ablation zones and higher sphericity index in ex vivo bovine tissues with minimal backward heating when compared with the monopole antenna.","","","","93ccafe9ab6228f6409b127c14bd7fe58f4c3c99","","","","","","Microwave ablation of ex vivo bovine tissues using a dual slot antenna with a floating metallic sleeve","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93ccafe9ab6228f6409b127c14bd7fe58f4c3c99","","2016"

Although imaging techniques are available to detect subsurface BAT, there are currently no viable methods for continuous acquisition of BAT energy expenditure. Microwave (MW) radiometry is an emerging technology that allows the quantification of tissue temperature variations at depths of several centimeters. Such temperature differentials may be correlated with variations in metabolic rate, thus providing a quantitative approach to monitor BAT metabolism. In order to optimize MW radiometry, numerical and experimental phantoms with accurate dielectric properties are required to develop and calibrate radiometric sensors. Thus, we present for the first time, the characterization of relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues in rats across the MW range 0.5–10 GHz. Measurements were carried out in situ and post mortem in six female rats of approximately 200 g. A Cole–Cole model was used to fit the experimental data into a parametric model that describes the variation of dielectric properties as a function of frequency. Measurements confirm that the dielectric properties of BAT (εr = 14.0–19.4, σ = 0.3–3.3 S m−1) are significantly higher than those of WAT (εr = 9.1–11.9, σ = 0.1–1.9 S m−1), in accordance with the higher water content of BAT.","","","","becc25be56b3ba08e050a2d1bd510a74ea66ca92","","","","","","Dielectric properties measurements of brown and white adipose tissue in rats from 0.5 to 10 GHz","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/becc25be56b3ba08e050a2d1bd510a74ea66ca92","","2016"

Average ACS is important in non-ionizing dosimetry and exposure studies, and is closely related to the whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (WBSAR). The average ACS was measured with a statistical uncertainty of less than 3% and high frequency resolution for individuals with a range of body shapes and sizes allowing the statistical distribution of WBSAR over a real population with individual internal and external morphologies to be determined. The average ACS of all subjects was found to vary from 0.15 to 0.4 m2; for an individual subject it falls with frequency over 1–6 GHz, and then rises slowly over the 6–12 GHz range in which few other studies have been conducted. Average ACS and WBSAR are then used as a surrogate for worst-case ACS/WBSAR, in order to study their variability across a real population compared to literature results from simulations using numerical phantoms with a limited range of anatomies. Correlations with body morphological parameters such as height, mass and waist circumference have been investigated: the strongest correlation is with body surface area (BSA) at all frequencies above 1 GHz, however direct proportionality to BSA is not established until above 5 GHz. When the average ACS is normalized to the BSA, the resulting absorption efficiency shows a negative correlation with the estimated thickness of subcutaneous body fat. Surrogate models and statistical analysis of the measurement data are presented and compared to similar models from the literature. The overall dispersion of measured average WBSAR of the sample of the UK population studied is consistent with the dispersion of simulated worst-case WBSAR across multiple numerical phantom families. The statistical results obtained allow the calibration of human exposure assessments made with particular phantoms to a population with a range of individual morphologies.","","","","254e11494445f597158942a50a97170d4b4b2b50","","","","","","Average absorption cross-section of the human body measured at 1–12 GHz in a reverberant chamber: results of a human volunteer study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/254e11494445f597158942a50a97170d4b4b2b50","","2014"

The feasibility of using the generic model in numerical research of electromagnetic fields (EMF) was demonstrated by means of comparative simulations with eye models reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) scans. Free‐form deformation (FFD) was used to deform the OAL of the generic eye model. Thus, 64 deformed eyes were created and were categorized according to the OAL increase. The finite‐difference time‐domain (FDTD) method was applied in the simulations. The results revealed that changing the OAL does not increase EMF absorption in the eyes or the eye tissues.

We propose two methods based upon a fixed set of finite‐difference time‐domain (FDTD) simulations for generating cumulative distribution functions for the SARosa in a certain environment: an accurate vectorial cell‐wise spline interpolation with an average error lower than 1.8%, and a faster scalar linear interpolation with a maximal average error of 14.3%. These errors are dependent on the angular steps chosen for the FDTD simulations. However, it is demonstrated that both methods provide the same shape of the cumulative distribution function for the studied organs in the considered environments. The SARosa depends on the considered organ and the environment. Two factors influencing the SARosa are investigated for the first time: conductivity over the density ratio of an organ, and the distance of the organ's center of gravity to the body's surface and exterior of the phantom. A non‐linear regression with our model provides a correlation of 0.80. The SARosa due to single plane‐wave exposure is also investigated; a worst‐case single plane‐wave exposure is determined for all studied organs and has been compared with realistic SARosa values. There is no fixed worst‐case polarization for all organs, and a single plane‐wave exposure condition that exceeds 91% of the SARosa values in a certain environment can always be found for the studied organs.

For this purpose, the basic restrictions and reference levels defined by the International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) for both the general public and occupational exposure are used. The antennas are designed for Global System for Mobile Communications around 900 MHz (GSM900), GSM1800, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), and Long Term Evolution (LTE), and are operated with output powers at the individual frequencies up to 300 W. The compliance boundaries are estimated using finite‐difference time‐domain simulations with the Virtual Family Male and have been determined for three directions with respect to the antennas for 800, 900, 1800, and 2600 MHz. The reference levels are not always conservative when the radiating part of the antenna is small compared to the length of the body. Combined compliance distances, which ensure compliance with all reference levels and basic restrictions, have also been determined for each frequency. A method to determine a conservative estimation of compliance boundaries for multiple‐frequency (cumulative) exposure is introduced. Using the errors on the estimated allowed powers, an uncertainty analysis is carried out for the compliance distances. Uncertainties on the compliance distances are found to be smaller than 122%.

Since simulations with large model spaces, or long non-sinusoidal waveforms, imply a huge amount of floating-point calculations, it is of practical interest to take advantage of current and emergent multicore architectures, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate this type of processing. The presented manuscript assess and compares the performance of different parallelization frameworks and different multicore architectures for exploiting parallelism when Maxwell's Equations have to be solved. The simulation of a plane wave propagation was used to assess the parallelization frameworks and options by using different application programming interfaces (APIs) and compilers. Moreover, implementations using these different approaches were executed in different CPU and GPUs architectures. Experimental results show that different frameworks led to different performance and, as expected, the GPUs achieve higher speedups when compared to CPUs.

Driven by the developments in computational techniques and computing power, personalised hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) has matured and has become a powerful tool for optimising treatment quality. Electromagnetic, ultrasound, and thermal simulations using realistic clinical set-ups are now being performed to achieve patient-specific treatment optimisation. In addition, extensive studies aimed to properly implement novel HT tools and techniques, and to assess the quality of HT, are becoming more common. In this paper, we review the simulation tools and techniques developed for clinical hyperthermia, and evaluate their current status on the path from ‘model’ to ‘clinic’. In addition, we illustrate the major techniques employed for validation and optimisation. HTP has become an essential tool for improvement, control, and assessment of HT treatment quality. As such, it plays a pivotal role in the quest to establish HT as an efficacious addition to multi-modality treatment of cancer.","","","","373d67150b8500cdd0f42afaa56aa355077551d0","","","","","","Simulation techniques in hyperthermia treatment planning","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/373d67150b8500cdd0f42afaa56aa355077551d0","","2013"

In this work, the distribution of SAR10g around bilateral CoCrMo alloy hip prostheses in situ in anatomically realistic voxel models of an adult male and female due to RF fields from a generic birdcage coil driven at 64 or 128 MHz are predicted using a time‐domain finite integration technique. Results indicate that the spatial distribution and maximum values of SAR10g are dependent on body model, frequency, and the position of the coil relative to the body. Enhancement of SAR10g close to the extremities of a prosthesis is predicted. Values of SAR10g close to the prostheses are compliant with recommended limits if the prostheses are located outside the coil. However, caution is required when the prostheses are within the coil since the predicted SAR10g close to an extremity of a prosthesis exceeds recommended limits when the whole body averaged SAR is 2 W kg−1. Compliance with recommended limits is likely to require a reduction in the time averaged input power.

"454",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","This article reviews occupational exposure in clinical MRI; it specifically considers units of exposure, basic physical interactions, health effects, guideline limits, dosimetry, results of exposure surveys, calculation of induced fields and the status of the European Physical Agents Directive. Electromagnetic field exposure in MRI from the static field B(0), imaging gradients and radiofrequency transmission fields induces electric fields and currents in tissue, which are responsible for various acute sensory effects. The underlying theory and its application to the formulation of incident and induced field limits are presented. The recent International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers limits for incident field exposure are interpreted in a manner applicable to MRI. Field measurements show that exposure from movement within the B(0) fringe field can exceed ICNIRP reference levels within 0.5 m of the bore entrance. Rate of change of field dB/dt from the imaging gradients is unlikely to exceed the new limits, although incident field limits can be exceeded for radiofrequency (RF) exposure within 0.2-0.5 m of the bore entrance. Dosimetric surveys of routine clinical practice show that staff are exposed to peak values of 42 ± 24% of B(0), with time-averaged exposures of 5.2 ± 2.8 mT for magnets in the range 0.6-4 T. Exposure to time-varying fields arising from movement within the B(0) fringe resulted in peak dB/dt of approximately 2 T s(-1). Modelling of induced electric fields from the imaging gradients shows that ICNIRP-induced field limits are unlikely to be exceeded in most situations; however, movement through the static field may still present a problem. The likely application of the limits is discussed with respect to the reformulation of the European Union (EU) directive and its possible implications for MRI.","","","","09ab53fa23951f37a7a81a863996b088a78fb8ce","","","","","","Occupational exposure in MRI.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09ab53fa23951f37a7a81a863996b088a78fb8ce","","2012"

SAR estimation is typically performed by numerical simulations using generic human body models. This entails an intrinsic uncertainty in present SAR prediction. This study first investigates the required detail of human body models in terms of spatial resolution and the number of soft tissue classes required, based on finite‐differences time‐domain simulations of a 3 T body coil. The numerical results indicate that a resolution of 5 mm is sufficient for local SAR estimation. Moreover, a differentiation between fatty tissues, water‐rich tissues, and the lungs was found to be essential to represent eddy current paths inside the human body. This study then proposes a novel approach for generating individualized body models from whole‐body water‐fat‐separated MR data and applies it to volunteers. The SAR hotspots consistently occurred in the arms due to proximity to the body coil as well as in narrow regions of the muscles. An initial in vivo validation of the simulated fields in comparison with measured B1‐field maps showed good qualitative and quantitative agreement.

Special attention was given to simultaneous exposure to fields of three different frequencies, their interaction and the additivity of SAR resulting from each frequency. The results show that the highest frequency—2100 MHz—results in the highest spatial‐peak SAR averaged over 10 g of tissue, while the whole‐body SAR is similar at all three frequencies. At distances >200 mm from the antenna, the whole‐body SAR is a more limiting factor for compliance to exposure guidelines, while at shorter distances the spatial‐peak SAR may be more limiting.

These values are below the IEEE standard recommended limits of 53 mV/m for the brain and 943 mV/m for the heart. The VH data allowed us to obtain two- and three-dimensional images of the induced electric field and current density distribution in different organs, tissues, and cross-sections of the human body.","","","","5909006be24e0e3a07dfe4cab29ed0d6a7d8a451","","","","","","Visible Human Utilization to Render Induced Electric Field and Current Density Images Inside the Human","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5909006be24e0e3a07dfe4cab29ed0d6a7d8a451","","2009"

The procedure is based on a set of formulae for estimating the specific absorption rate (SAR) in certain directions around a class of common base station antennas. The formulae, given for both whole-body and localized SAR, require as input the frequency, the transmitted power and knowledge of antenna-related parameters such as dimensions, directivity and half-power beamwidths. With knowledge of the SAR in three key directions it is demonstrated how simple and practical compliance boundaries can be generated outside of which the exposure levels do not exceed certain limit values. The conservativeness of the proposed procedure is discussed based on results from numerical radio frequency (RF) exposure simulations with human body phantoms from the recently developed Virtual Family.","","","","86868f2f57f2eb3d0b0285690455c0248fa6e652","","","","","","The generation of simple compliance boundaries for mobile communication base station antennas using formulae for SAR estimation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86868f2f57f2eb3d0b0285690455c0248fa6e652","","2009"

Preliminary validation of the MHD solver shows good agreement with values found in the literature [7] based on computational modeling. The implemented MHD solver is also able to calculate the induced fields in highly accurate models of the human anatomy. We will repeat the simulations in the future with an exact model of the geometry used in [7]. In addition we will perform an experimental validation to compare the MHD solver results with actual measurements. Future simulations will also include the calculation of the MHD signals for all four models of the Virtual Family. We will vary the orientation of the static magnetic field to maximize the MHD signal, and we will determine an optimized location for the measurement of the MHD signal. The optimal location for measuring the MHD signal is a location on the surface of the patient which maximizes the signal strength and optimizes the correlation of the MDH signal to the blood flow by minimizing the influence of the ECG signal. The volunteers based on which the Virtual Family models were developed (two adults and two children) will be used to measure the ECG signal and the combined ECG + MDH signal. The combined ECG + MDH will be measured inside a 3T MR scanner using an MR compatible ECG monitor. We will correlate the computational MHD results with the actual measurement. Based on this information we hope to develop a MHD based biomarker to non-invasively estimate the blood flow for the evaluation of heart failure.","","","","d16fa9a493edf91b011e03b969341665661c0687","","","","","","Development of a magneto-hydrodynamic solver for anatomical models","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d16fa9a493edf91b011e03b969341665661c0687","","2009"

In contrast, information about the EMP energy distribution and its variability in rats is lacking. EMPs are signals with spectrum concentrating in several hundred MHz, leading to EM absorption patterns different from those obtained at high frequencies. In this study, two anatomical models of rats (a male and a female) were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging. The models had the same posture as in the exposure experiments. Realistic EMPs were acquired directly from the EMP simulator and applied to the simulations. The interaction of the EMP with the rat was analyzed through the finite-difference time-domain method. Two approaches were utilized to calculate the energy absorption at the tissue and whole-body levels. Dosimetric variability due to incident directions, polarizations, exposure signals simplification, and rat separation was evaluated in this study. The variability result differed substantially from that of the non-constrained rats' exposure experiments. The result sensitivity to frequency and amplitude was discussed as well. The work can be used as a basis to determine the uncertainty and to formulate a standard experimental protocol for this type of experiment.","","","","40a887b2ec47bee613f9e23a109ce1181ccfbbed","","","","","","Dosimetric variability of the rats' exposure to electromagnetic pulses","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40a887b2ec47bee613f9e23a109ce1181ccfbbed","","2015"

The maximum predicted temperature (45.8°C for an incident power density of 475 mW/cm2) is in good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the model shows that there is a value for the incident power density (about 100 mW/cm2) for which the direction of aqueous humor flow due to buoyancy is inverted, because of the inversion of the temperature gradient in the anterior chamber of the eye.

The aim of the paper were to assess fall risks and identify risk factors, related to falls among stroke patients. This was a retrospective cohort study that included 217 neurological patients with acute stroke who have experienced fall during hospitalization. Morse Fall Scale was used to estimate a likelihood of falling for hospitalized patients. In total, 1.4% patients with acute stroke experienced a fall during hospitalization. According to the fall risk assessment, 77% of the patients presented a high risk for falls. Women, older respondents and those who were hospitalized for period longer than 22 days and who had higher levels of care, had higher values of Morse score. The most common risk factors for falls are: the presence of other medical diagnosis, the use of disability aids while walking, the use of intravenous therapy, disorientation in time and space, and the largest contribution to Morse score comes from using disability aids while walking and transferring patients. Greater risk of falling was observed in older neurological patients with ischemic type of stroke and weakness on the left side of the body, patients with longer hospitalization period and those with higher level of care.","","","","a70ddd6bf1c8029c122af4ceb7915897b6411b56","","","","","","Risk Factors and Characteristics of Falls Among Hospitalized Stroke Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a70ddd6bf1c8029c122af4ceb7915897b6411b56","","2019"
"476",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","AIM AND OBJECTIVES
To describe associations between patient fall risk and common symptoms among hospitalised inpatients.


BACKGROUND
Predictors of falls have been identified in a variety of populations and settings, but the role of inpatients' symptom experience has not been adequately evaluated.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional.


METHODS
Participants included 614 medical and elective surgical patients in an acute hospital in Norway. Patient falls during hospitalisation were assessed by self-report and incident reports. Pain intensity and the occurrence and distress of 15 other symptoms were assessed by self-report.


RESULTS
Patient falls were associated with male sex and having more comorbidities. Medical patients were more likely to fall than elective surgical patients. In logistic regression analyses, higher symptom counts were associated with increased risk of fall, with each additional symptom conferring a 15% increase in fall risk. Symptom distress related to concentration difficulties, lack of energy, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea was associated with increased risk of fall, even after adjusting for the influence of age, sex and comorbidities (odds ratios ranged 2.3-4.8). Severe pain, as well as symptom distress related to drowsiness, itching, dizziness or swelling of arms/legs, was also associated with patient falls, although these associations were attenuated after accounting for age, sex and comorbidities. Overall, symptom distress was more strongly associated with fall risk than symptom occurrence.


CONCLUSIONS
Symptom burden and distress may help identify hospital patients at risk for fall. Additional research is needed to determine whether symptoms are useful for assessing fall risk among hospital patients and other high-risk populations. If symptoms are useful indicators of fall risk, they should be considered for inclusion in standardised risk assessments.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Clinicians ought to pay particular attention to increased fall risk among patients reporting many symptoms and those experiencing distress from concentration difficulties, fatigue, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.","","","","0a6d9230625ee82ea130932cf30500619f14d525","","","","","","Associations between patient symptoms and falls in an acute care hospital: A cross‐sectional study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a6d9230625ee82ea130932cf30500619f14d525","","2018"

"482",":Paper","CC-BY","In the past 5 years, we have witnessed the continuation of important trends in clinical research that began earlier in the decade. With regard to the treatment of specific disorders in children and adolescents, the most significant developments have been the examination of the tricyclics for the treatment of depression and the initiation of controlled studies for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. Unfortunately, the findings from the depression studies have been uniformly negative, and the results of research on both depression and tic disorders show a relatively high rate of placebo responsivity, which raises nagging questions about the role of case reports and open trials. Another important trend in pediatric psychopharmacotherapy is the search for substitutes for the neuroleptics. Potential candidates include agents such as lithium, naltrexone, fenfluramine, clonidine, and carbamazepine. The most underresearched disorders are a combination of the least common (e.g. schizophrenia, mania) and those that are apparently perceived as less serious (e.g. sleep disorders, certain anxiety disorders). Not surprisingly, the most studied disorder and treatment is hyperactivity and stimulant medication, respectively. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the social implications of the associated symptoms and their response to stimulant drugs, aided greatly by the use of direct observation procedures. Researchers are beginning to attend to the implications of comorbidity for assessing response to medication. There has been additional confirmation of efficacy of stimulant treatment for preschoolers and adolescents. Dose-response issues remain to some extent unresolved, the primary impediments being interpretive misconceptions associated with trend analysis, an overreliance on the syndromal perspective and too little attention to target behaviors and their clinical implications, and the failure to operationalize the minimal effective dose with regard to the normalization and supranormalization of target and collateral behaviors. Disagreement over whether hyperactivity is a learning or a behavior disorder (or both) and what academic underproductivity means clinically and socially is also impeding progress. With regard to developmental disorders, controlled studies indicate that fenfluramine and naltrexone are effective for managing associated symptoms in some individuals. However, given the limited amount of research on these agents, their status as clinically useful palliatives must be considered tentative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","","","","b2d82800a5747ddd0c5c6c22ba72c3a2ec9d0a29","","","","","","Pediatric psychopharmacotherapy: a review of recent research.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2d82800a5747ddd0c5c6c22ba72c3a2ec9d0a29","","1992"

"485",":Paper","CC-BY","BACKGROUND
Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with just antipsychotic drug treatment and various adjunct medications are used to promote additional response. The antiepileptic carbamazepine is one such drug.


OBJECTIVES
To examine whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychoses and whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine augmentation of neuroleptic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses.


SEARCH METHODS
For the original version we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (December 2001), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), Biological Abstracts (1980-2001), PsycLIT (1886-2001) and PSYNDEX (1974-2001). For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials in July 2012. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carbamazepine or compounds of the carbamazepine family with placebo or no intervention, whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective psychoses.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect, risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.


MAIN RESULTS
The updated search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. The number of included studies therefore remains at 10 with the number of participants randomised still 283.One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months. No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n = 31, RR 1.07 CI 0.78 to 1.45). Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia. No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores (1 RCT n = 38, RR 1.23 CI 0.78 to 1.92). A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n = 38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.043). Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo, we were able use GRADE for quality of evidence for these results. Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n = 182, RR 0.47 CI 0.16 to 1.35, very low quality evidence). Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2 RCTs n = 38, RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.88). There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n = 147, RR 0.86 CI 0.67 to 1.12, low quality evidence). Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.38 CI 0.14 to 1.02). No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder.

Methylphenidate (MPH) ameliorates attention problems experienced by some cancer survivors in the short term, but its long-term efficacy is unproven.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study investigates the long-term effectiveness of maintenance doses of MPH in survivors of childhood brain tumors (n = 35) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 33) participating in a 12-month MPH trial. Measures of attention (Conners' Continuous Performance Test [CPT], Conners' Rating Scales [CRS]), academic abilities (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test [WIAT]), social skills (Social Skills Rating System [SSRS]), and behavioral problems (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) were administered at premedication baseline and at the end of the MPH trial while on medication. A cancer control group composed of patients who were not administered MPH (brain tumor = 31 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia = 23) was assessed on the same measures 12 [corrected] months apart.


RESULTS
For the MPH group, repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant improvement in performance on a measure of sustained attention (CPT indices, P < .05); parent, teacher, and self-report ratings of attention (CRS indices, P < .05), and parent ratings of social skills or behavioral problems (SSRS and CBCL indices; P < .05). In contrast, the cancer control group only showed improvement on parent ratings of attention (Conners' Parent Rating Scale indices; P < .05) and social skills (SSRS and CBCL indices; P < .05). There was no significant improvement on the academic measure (WIAT) in either group.


CONCLUSION
Attention and behavioral benefits of MPH for childhood cancer survivors are maintained across settings over the course of a year. Although academic gains were not identified, MPH may offer benefits in academic areas not assessed.","","","","81be5e3567910326d59d692df11f236b43774afd","","","","","","Long-term efficacy of methylphenidate in enhancing attention regulation, social skills, and academic abilities of childhood cancer survivors.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81be5e3567910326d59d692df11f236b43774afd","","2010"
"487",":Paper","CC-BY","OBJECTIVE
To investigate the methylphenidate (MPH) response rate among childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and brain tumors (BTs) and to identify predictors of positive MPH response.


METHODS
Cancer survivors (N = 106; BT = 51 and ALL = 55) identified as having attention deficits and learning problems participated in a 3-week, double-blind, crossover trial consisting of placebo, low-dose MPH (0.3 mg/kg), and moderate-dose MPH (0.6 mg/kg). Weekly teacher and parent reports on the Conners' Rating Scales were gathered.


RESULTS
Following moderate MPH dose, 45.28% of the sample was classified as responders. Findings revealed that more problems endorsed prior to the medication trial on parent and teacher ratings were predictive of positive medication response (p < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
MPH significantly reduces attention problems in a subset of childhood cancer survivors. Parent and teacher ratings may assist in identifying children most likely to respond to MPH so prescribing may be optimally targeted.","","","","9b1af0c58f9ebd304cf479b374e4b01e679066f0","","","","","","Predicting methylphenidate response in long-term survivors of childhood cancer: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b1af0c58f9ebd304cf479b374e4b01e679066f0","","2010"
"488",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency and severity of side effects of methylphenidate among childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors and identify predictors of higher adverse effect levels. METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors (N = 103) identified as having attention and learning problems completed a randomized, double-blind, 3-week, home-crossover trial of placebo, low-dose methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg; 10 mg twice daily maximum) and moderate-dose methylphenidate (0.6 mg/kg; 20 mg twice daily maximum). Caregivers completed the Barkley Side Effects Rating Scale (SERS) at baseline and each week during the medication trial. Siblings of cancer survivors (N = 49) were recruited as a healthy comparison group. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher number and severity of symptoms endorsed on the SERS when patients were taking moderate dose compared with placebo or low dose, but not low dose compared with placebo. The number of side effects endorsed on the SERS was significantly lower during all 3 home-crossover weeks (placebo, low dose, moderate dose) when compared with baseline symptom scores. The severity of side effects was also significantly lower, compared with baseline screening, during placebo and low-dose weeks but not moderate-dose weeks. Both the number and severity of symptoms endorsed at baseline were significantly higher for patients compared with siblings. Female gender and lower IQ were associated with higher adverse effect levels. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate is generally well tolerated by childhood cancer survivors. There is a subgroup at increased risk for side effects that may need to be closely monitored or prescribed a lower medication dose. The seemingly paradoxical findings of increased “side effects” at baseline must be considered when monitoring side effects and designing clinical trials.","","","","dd6e1210cdf7e6663955d370cb725eeab88660db","","","","","","Side Effects of Methylphenidate in Childhood Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd6e1210cdf7e6663955d370cb725eeab88660db","","2009"

"490",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","A limited number of studies have considered whether the activity of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) contributes to the problems experienced by youngsters with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this article is to review this work and propose interpretations. Peripheral measures of 5-HT and its metabolite do not point to a widespread association with the diagnosis. However, separate consideration of the major domains of dysfunction (motor activity, inattention and impulsivity) support a more differentiated assessment. The marked innervation of motor regions of the brain by 5-HT projections and the clear involvement of 5-HT systems in the control of locomotion in animals suggests a likely node for dysfunction in ADHD. The few relevant studies do not show evidence of this, but more attention should be accorded to the issue. The situation is different for attention-related processes; here, there are deficiencies in perceptual sensitivity and the appropriate designation of saliency to stimulation. These are attributable, in part, to altered 5-HT activity. Marked and opposite changes of 5-HT responsivity are associated with behavioral and cognitive impulsivity. There is also a growing series of studies demonstrating preferential transmission of various genetic markers for 5-HT receptors that are expressed in ADHD. Currently, the heterogeneity of methods in this young discipline restricts the possibilities of definition of these markers and the types of ADHD in which they are expressed.","","","","afe7ba9532c568d97a6484e46fe457ed63906698","","","","","","Role of the serotonin system in ADHD: treatment implications","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afe7ba9532c568d97a6484e46fe457ed63906698","","2007"
"491",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","BACKGROUND
Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with just antipsychotic drug treatment and various adjunct medications are used to promote additional response. The antiepileptic carbamazepine is one such drug.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effects of carbamazepine and its derivatives for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychoses.


SEARCH STRATEGY
For the original version we searched Biological Abstracts (1980-2001), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (December 2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), PsycLIT (1886-2001) and PSYNDEX (1974-2001). For the current update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials in March 2005 and in December 2006. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing carbamazepine or compounds of the carbamazepine family to placebo or no intervention, whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective psychoses.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).


MAIN RESULTS
The update search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. The number of included studies therefore remains at ten with the number of participants randomised still 258. One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months. No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n=31, RR 4.1 CI 0.8 to 1.5). Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia. No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in BPRS scores (1 RCT n=38, RR 1.2 CI 0.8 to 1.9). A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n=38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.04, NNH 1 CI 0.9 to 1.4). Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo. Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n=182, RR 0.5 CI 0.2 to 1.4). Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2RCTs n=38, RR 0.6 CI 0.4 to 0.9, NNT 2 CI 1 to 5). There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n=147, RR 0.9 CI 0.7 to 1.1). Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n=20, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.0). No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Based on currently available randomised trial-derived evidence, carbamazepine cannot be recommended for routine clinical use for treatment or augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. At present large, simple well-designed and reported trials are justified especially if focusing on those with violent episodes and people with schizoaffective disorders or those with both schizophrenia and EEG abnormalities.","","","","504f91ece64ab1bf8dfaf086eca4ed9fe5fcc656","","","","","","Carbamazepine for schizophrenia.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/504f91ece64ab1bf8dfaf086eca4ed9fe5fcc656","","2007"

To examine clinical practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes regarding the use of both nonprescription and prescription medications by community-based pediatricians for children with significant difficulties in initiating and/or maintaining sleep.


METHODS
A survey was mailed to 3424 American Academy of Pediatrics members in 6 US cities.


RESULTS
The final sample (n = 671) consisted of practitioners who identified themselves as primary care pediatricians. Three percent +/- 7% of visits in the respondents' practices were for pediatric insomnia, although there was a wide range in the numbers of children identified during a typical 6-month practice period. More than 75% of practitioners had recommended nonprescription medications, and >50% had prescribed a sleep medication. Specific clinical circumstances in which medications were most commonly used were acute pain and travel, followed by children with special needs (mental retardation, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Antihistamines were the most commonly reported nonprescription medications for sleep. Melatonin or herbal remedies had been recommended by approximately 15% of the respondents. alpha-agonists were the most frequently prescribed sleep medications (31%). The likelihood of prescribing medication for sleep was 2- to 4-fold greater in respondents who treated children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for daytime behavioral problems or nocturnal sleep problems, respectively. Practitioners expressed a range of concerns about sleep medication appropriateness, safety, tolerance, and side effects in children.


CONCLUSIONS
The practice of prescribing or recommending sedatives and hypnotics for pediatric insomnia is common among community-based pediatricians, especially among special needs patients. An empirically based approach to the use of these medications is needed.","","","","149b2e05a9b22e1220445e05f1737e7633d7fbd2","","","","","","Medication use in the treatment of pediatric insomnia: results of a survey of community-based pediatricians.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/149b2e05a9b22e1220445e05f1737e7633d7fbd2","","2003"

To evaluate the theoretical merit and empirical validity of models designed to predict response to methylphenidate (MPH) among children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).


METHOD
Seventy-six children with ADHD received each of 4 counterbalanced doses of MPH (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg) in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject (crossover) experimental design. Logical and conceptual foundations of 3 models of MPH response were subjected to critical scrutiny, and patterns of relationship anticipated on the basis of these models were subjected to empirical analysis.


RESULTS
The conceptual foundations of all reviewed models were found to be substantially flawed, and none provided an adequate empirical basis for predicting response to MPH among children with ADHD.


CONCLUSIONS
The observed pattern of relationships suggests that magnitudes of response to MPH in domains of classroom attention and behavioral disinhibition are correlated and differentially predictive of response on measures of academic performance and teacher-rated behavior.","","","","cb924a53a79351897b329188bb5bcff5ffa1e256","","","","","","Predicting methylphenidate response in children with ADHD: theoretical, empirical, and conceptual models.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb924a53a79351897b329188bb5bcff5ffa1e256","","1999"

Diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by family physicians and pediatricians was most commonly based on brief behavioral descriptions by parents and, infrequently, by use of rating scales. At that time, the present researchers began to explore the development of a school-based, methodologically sound, and inexpensive method of assessing the efficacy of stimulant medications, which would ensure reasonable compliance by teachers, parents, and students in monitoring the effects of medications and placebos. This article focuses on the methodological issues involved in choosing instruments to monitor behavior, once a comprehensive evaluation has suggested trials on Ritalin.

To examine behavioral differences between children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tics and their peers and the extent to which methylphenidate (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) normalized the behavior of probands and indirectly influenced the behavior of peers (treatment spillover).


METHOD
Thirty-four prepubertal children with ADHD and chronic tic disorder (who were participating in a double-blind, placebo-controlled methylphenidate evaluation) and their peers were observed for approximately 20 hours in the school setting (classroom seatwork activities, lunchroom, and playground).


RESULTS
Children with ADHD and tics were more inattentive and more disruptive in the classroom and more aggressive in all school settings than their peers. Although treatment with methylphenidate made probands less easily distinguished from their peers (normalization), many children still scored in the deviant range for at least one ADHD behavior when receiving the 0.5-mg/kg dose. There was little evidence that peer behavior improved as a function of the proband's dose of medication.

Although conventional doses of methylphenidate produced dramatic clinical improvement in ADHD-related behavior, complete behavioral normalization is often not attained.","","","","4556b5d36369c2c96ad7ca2cf96adae081ae473d","","","","","","Children with ADHD and tic disorder and their classmates: behavioral normalization with methylphenidate.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4556b5d36369c2c96ad7ca2cf96adae081ae473d","","1997"
"506",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic, psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the pharmacology of aggression (FIG. 1). Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach. Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder, adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression It remains less clear that medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication intervention (FIG. 1). When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended. Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric efficacy in reducing aggression (TABLE 1) and that have a favorable safety profile. Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile. Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents, propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric aggression.

The findings from case reports and patient questionnaire surveys have been interpreted as indicating that administration of stimulants is ill-advised for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children with tic disorder.


METHODS
Thirty-four prepubertal children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and tic disorder received placebo and three dosages of methylphenidate hydrochloride (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 weeks each, under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and using rating scales completed by the parents, teachers, and physician.


RESULTS
Methylphenidate effectively suppressed hyperactive, disruptive, and aggressive behavior. There was no evidence that methylphenidate altered the severity of tic disorder, but it may have a weak effect on the frequency of motor (increase) and vocal (decrease) tics.


CONCLUSION
Methylphenidate appears to be a safe and effective treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the majority of children with comorbid tic disorder.","","","","77d4ed0918d5d7be8cf2469d68f71abcd987f921","","","","","","Efficacy of methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children with tic disorder.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77d4ed0918d5d7be8cf2469d68f71abcd987f921","","1995"
"508",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the pattern of prescribing antidepressant (AD) drugs by British child psychiatrists with particular emphasis on the impact of newer-type (heterocyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) agents on this practice and to assess the safety of AD use for children in terms of clinicians' reports of adverse effects.


METHOD
A short postal survey asking specific questions about these aspects of their clinical practice was sent to 350 British child psychiatrists.


RESULTS
The response rate was 71%. A clear majority of the 238 respondents (85%) who provided analyzable reports had prescribed ADs, the most popular of these being amitriptyline and imipramine, although nearly one third of prescribers also used newer agents occasionally and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors specifically, very rarely indeed. British child psychiatrists issued only one or two new prescriptions for AD medication per year. ADs were being used for a wide range of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders beyond the product data sheet-recommended indications of ""depression"" and ""nocturnal enuresis."" High rates of mostly mild adverse effects were reported in children treated with older-type ADs; however, the use of newer ADs did not appear to have influenced this picture when the reports of prescribers of only older ADs were compared with reports of those who also prescribed newer agents.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite a willingness to use this form of treatment, British child psychiatrists tend to use it very sparingly compared to practices revealed in American studies. The preferential and infrequent use of older AD agents may account for the high rates of adverse effects reported. These practices do not allow clinicians to become familiar with, and thus more comfortable about, using newer agents.","","","","2da625564e960abefe4deb6c7cddb665fdffa1e9","","","","","","Antidepressant prescription by British child psychiatrists: practice and safety issues.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2da625564e960abefe4deb6c7cddb665fdffa1e9","","1995"

The responders took part in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. They ingested a placebo (PL) or MPH (0.3-0.6 mg/kg/day) during 4 weeks, and were then tested. After crossover, another period of 4 weeks was concluded by a second test series. Compared to controls, both responders and nonresponders showed attention deficits in encoding, memory search, and decision operations, as well as in focused and sustained attention, vigilance, and use of feedback. These deficits were the most severe in the responders. Anamnestic data, IQ scores, and neurological variables did not discriminate between groups. MPH selectively alleviates attention deficits. MPH did not affect divided attention, except for an increased accuracy of response organization. The drug, however, greatly improved focused and sustained attention, vigilance, impulsivity, and the behavioral adaptivity to feedback.","","","","a434fa3d5c652793532d64adfb341886dcab246a","","","","","","Methylphenidate and information processing.

To evaluate the magnitude and clinical significance of methylphenidate (MPH) effects on the classroom behavior and academic performance of 76 children with attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity (ADDH).


METHOD
A double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject (crossover) experimental design was used to evaluate acute MPH effects at four dose levels (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg) on children's attention, academic functioning, and behavior in regular classroom settings. Results were contrasted with a normal control sample.


RESULTS
Standard statistical analysis revealed MPH effects on classroom functioning that were primarily linear. Analysis of the clinical significance of effects indicated that large proportions of treated children exhibited significantly improved or normalized classroom functioning; however, a large subset of them failed to show improved academic functioning. Overall, children failing to respond at lower dose levels have a high probability of improving or becoming normalized as a function of increasing dose.


CONCLUSIONS
For a majority of children with ADDH, MPH results in significantly improved or normalized attention and classroom behavior. A significant subset, however, fail to realize gains in their academic functioning and will require supplemental interventions.","","","","7ed2688f59ae33e084788b2c17114515c4955a17","","","","","","Attention deficit disorder and methylphenidate: normalization rates, clinical effectiveness, and response prediction in 76 children.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ed2688f59ae33e084788b2c17114515c4955a17","","1994"

This study was designed to assess outpatient child psychiatrists' prescribing practices.


METHOD
Of 1,422 outpatients in two public, university affiliated settings in New York and Ohio, the charts of 146 medicated and 126 nonmedicated randomly selected patients were reviewed for demographic variables, DSM-III-R diagnoses, medications prescribed, and charted prescription rationales.


RESULTS
Fifteen percent of the 800 outpatients seen in a 1-month period in New York, and 19% of the 626 outpatients seen in a 1-year period in Ohio were prescribed medication. Patients medicated by clinic psychiatrists were significantly more likely than nonmedicated patients to be psychotic and to have been hospitalized previously, and significantly less likely to have adjustment disorder. Using standards employed by drug utilization review committees, medications were prescribed appropriately in approximately 90% of cases. Of concern, 65% of patients given antipsychotics in New York and 67% in Ohio were not psychotic; the primary target symptom in such cases was aggression.


CONCLUSIONS
Prescribing practices appeared to be appropriate, although the use of antipsychotic medications in nonpsychotic children is a concern for the field of child psychiatry. The strong similarity of practices in two independent and geographically remote sites suggests the findings are generalizable to providers in other public, university affiliated settings.","","","","9014f56de6e0142589f45a4d7dc6a1b61ae896c2","","","","","","Prescribing practices of outpatient child psychiatrists.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9014f56de6e0142589f45a4d7dc6a1b61ae896c2","","1994"

Analysis indicated changes in all components, with details suggesting the site(s) of action of this type of antihistamine. The cross-section of the auditory system yielded by this battery makes it possible to observe effects at the periphery, in the brainstem, and in the cortex, including evidence linking otoacoustic emissions with central auditory physiology.

"522",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of three daily dosage regimens of oral piracetam in patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. METHODS Twenty patients (12 men, eight women), aged 17–43 years, with classical Unverricht-Lundborg disease were enrolled in a multicentre, randomised, double blind trial of crossover design in which the effects of daily doses of 9.6 g, 16.8 g, and 24 g piracetam, given in two divided doses, were compared with placebo. The crossover design was such that patients received placebo and two of the three dosage regimens of piracetam, each for two weeks, for a total treatment period of six weeks and thus without wash out between each treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was a sum score representing the adjusted total of the ratings of six components of a myoclonus rating scale in which stimulus sensitivity, motor impairment, functional disability, handwriting, and global assessments by investigators and patients were scored. Sequential clinical assessments were made by the same neurologist in the same environment at the same time of day. RESULTS Treatment with 24 g/day piracetam produced significant and clinically relevant improvement in the primary outcome measure of mean sum score (p=0.005) and in the means of its subtests of motor impairment (p=0.02), functional disability (p=0.003), and in global assessments by both investigator (p=0.002) and patient (p=0.01). Significant improvement in functional disability was also found with daily doses of 9.6 g and 16.8 g. The dose-effect relation was linear and significant. More patients showed clinically relevant improvement with the highest dosage and, in individual patients, increasing the dose improved response. Piracetam was well tolerated and adverse effects were few, mild, and transient. CONCLUSIONS This study provides further evidence that piracetam is an effective and safe medication in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease. In addition, it shows that a dose of 24 g is highly beneficial, more effective than lower doses and that a dose-effect relation exists. There is considerable variation in optimal individual dosage.","","","","1b436474c48af6213b8406ebe8e8a953173ce19e","","","","","","Piracetam relieves symptoms in progressive myoclonus epilepsy: a multicentre, randomised, double blind, crossover study comparing the efficacy and safety of three dosages of oral piracetam with placebo","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b436474c48af6213b8406ebe8e8a953173ce19e","","1998"

"524",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The occurrence of cognitive deficits in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been recognized since 1877 when Charcot first observed ""enfeeblement of memory"" in his patients. Cognitive deficits have been reported in almost 50% of patients with a relapsing-remitting course and in a significantly higher percentage of patients with a chronic progressive course leading to intellectual disability which is often severe enough to preclude employment. MS is considered a form of subcortical dementia and the occurrence of classical cortical disorders such as aphasia, agnosia and apraxia is reported to be rare in the disease. However, in my experience alexia, a reading impairment unrelated to visual acuity or visual field defects, is common in patients with MS. Recently, I reported that treatment with picotesla range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) is an efficacious modality in the management of both the motor and cognitive symptoms of MS. Three patients with MS who developed alexia as a manifestation of the disease are presented. In all patients the alexia was reversed several months after they began treatment with EMFs. Since alexia usually reflects a disconnection syndrome whereby lesions involving the left visual cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum disconnect language association areas from visual association areas, it is suggested that reversal of the alexia in these patients by EMFs was related to improved interhemispheric transcallosal transmission of visual information. In addition, it is conceivable that changes in the metabolism of monoamines, which are involved in visual information processing and reading comprehension, may have been important in causing reversal of the alexia. This report further supports the unique efficacy of this treatment modality in reversing specific cognitive deficits in MS.","","","","2727c036ab4ef5becda724c63f535c314f5761a8","","","","","","Reversal of alexia in multiple sclerosis by weak electromagnetic fields.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2727c036ab4ef5becda724c63f535c314f5761a8","","1995"

"527",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Abstract Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis, disease activity and progression. Results from in vitro experiments, animal models and analysis of human samples from randomized controlled trials provide comprehensive data illustrating the pleiotropic actions of Vitamin D on the immune system. They globally result in immunomodulation by decreasing differentiation of effector T and B cells while promoting regulatory subsets. Vitamin D also modulates innate immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells, and acts at the level of the blood–brain barrier reducing immune cell trafficking. Vitamin D exerts additional activity within the central nervous system reducing microglial and astrocytic activation. The immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D detected in animal models of multiple sclerosis has suggested its potential therapeutic use for treating multiple sclerosis. In this review, we focus on recent published data describing the biological effects of Vitamin D in animal models of multiple sclerosis on immune cells, blood–brain barrier function, activation of glial cells and its potential neuroprotective effects. Based on the current knowledge, we also discuss optimization of therapeutic interventions with Vitamin D in patients with multiple sclerosis, as well as new technologies allowing in-depth analysis of immune cell regulations by vitamin D.","","","","d37defddfafe756a6f1c0a7a206bdf9c943b21e7","","","","","","Full spectrum of vitamin D immunomodulation in multiple sclerosis: mechanisms and therapeutic implications","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d37defddfafe756a6f1c0a7a206bdf9c943b21e7","","2022"
"528",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Vitamin D is best known for its role in maintaining bone health and calcium homeostasis. However, it also exerts a broad range of extra-skeletal effects on cellular physiology and on the immune system. Vitamins D2 and D3 share a high degree of structural similarity. Functional equivalence in their vitamin D-dependent effects on human physiology is usually assumed but has in fact not been well defined experimentally. In this study we seek to redress the gap in knowledge by undertaking an in-depth examination of changes in the human blood transcriptome following supplementation with physiological doses of vitamin D2 and D3. Our work extends a previously published randomized placebo-controlled trial that recruited healthy white European and South Asian women who were given 15 µg of vitamin D2 or D3 daily over 12 weeks in wintertime in the UK (Nov-Mar) by additionally determining changes in the blood transcriptome over the intervention period using microarrays. An integrated comparison of the results defines both the effect of vitamin D3 or D2 on gene expression, and any influence of ethnic background. An important aspect of this analysis was the focus on the changes in expression from baseline to the 12-week endpoint of treatment within each individual, harnessing the longitudinal design of the study. Whilst overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes was present in the D2 or D3-dependent effects identified, most changes were specific to either one vitamin or the other. The data also pointed to the possibility of ethnic differences in the responses. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding pathways of the innate and adaptive immune systems, potentially shifting the immune system to a more tolerogenic status. Surprisingly, gene expression associated with type I and type II interferon activity, critical to the innate response to bacterial and viral infections, differed following supplementation with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3, with only vitamin D3 having a stimulatory effect. This study suggests that further investigation of the respective physiological roles of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 is warranted.","","","","5579989f620cf06d83dab1c412b23342697a85c8","","","","","","Vitamins D2 and D3 Have Overlapping But Different Effects on the Human Immune System Revealed Through Analysis of the Blood Transcriptome","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5579989f620cf06d83dab1c412b23342697a85c8","","2022"

"533",":Paper","CC-BY","Rapid and effective neural transmission of information requires correct axonal myelination. Modifications in myelination alter axonal capacity to transmit electric impulses and enable pathological conditions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons, a complex process involving various cellular interactions. However, we know little about the mechanisms that orchestrate correct myelination. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Using female and male mutant mice to delete these proteins, we found that activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways was weaker in mice lacking one or both of these GTPases, suggesting that both proteins coordinate the activity of these two pathways. Loss of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 diminishes the number of OLs in major myelinated CNS tracts and increases the proportion of immature OLs. In R-Ras1−/− and R-Ras2−/−-null mice, OLs show aberrant morphologies and fail to differentiate correctly into myelin-forming phenotypes. The smaller OL population and abnormal OL maturation induce severe hypomyelination, with shorter nodes of Ranvier in R-Ras1−/− and/or R-Ras2−/− mice. These defects explain the slower conduction velocity of myelinated axons that we observed in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Together, these results suggest that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are upstream elements that regulate the survival and differentiation of progenitors into OLs through the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways for proper myelination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this study, we show that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 play essential roles in regulating myelination in vivo and control fundamental aspects of oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and differentiation through synergistic activation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK signaling. Mice lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 show a diminished OL population with a higher proportion of immature OLs, explaining the observed hypomyelination in main CNS tracts. In vivo electrophysiology recordings demonstrate a slower conduction velocity of nerve impulses in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Therefore, R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for proper axonal myelination and accurate neural transmission.","","","","e945d6513053863f2371d402efde295caa2935a2","","","","","","R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 Are Essential for Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Survival for Correct Myelination in the Central Nervous System","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e945d6513053863f2371d402efde295caa2935a2","","2018"

"535",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of death and permanent disability worldwide. The only efficient treatment to date is anticoagulant therapy and thrombectomy, which enable restitution of blood flow to ischemic tissues. Numerous promising neuroprotectants have failed in clinical trials. Given the complex pathomechanism of stroke, a multitarget pharmacotherapy seems a more rational approach in stroke prevention and treatment than drugs acting on single molecular targets. Recently, vitamin D3 has emerged as a potential treatment adjunct for ischemic stroke, as it interferes with the key prosurvival pathways and shows neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, regenerative and anti-aging properties in both neuronal and vascular tissue. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of vitamin D3 on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and neuroplasticity may play a role not only in the recovery of neurological functions, but also in ameliorating post-stroke depression and anxiety. This narrative review presents advances in research on the biochemical mechanisms of stroke-related brain damage, and the genomic and non-genomic effects of vitamin D3 which may interfere with diverse cell death signaling pathways. Next, we discuss the results of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on the neuroprotective potential of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in brain ischemia models. Finally, the outcomes of clinical trials on vitamin D3 efficiency in ischemic stroke patients are briefly reviewed. Despite the mixed results of the clinical trials, it appears that vitamin D3 still holds promise in preventing or ameliorating neurological and psychiatric consequences of ischemic stroke and certainly deserves further study.","","","","cbeefa525547a31e4a2d73e87edbe8f72a4135f6","","","","","","Vitamin D3 and Ischemic Stroke: A Narrative Review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cbeefa525547a31e4a2d73e87edbe8f72a4135f6","","2022"
"536",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Abstract The role of steroid hormones against infectious diseases has been extensively studied. From immunomodulatory action to direct inhibition of microorganism growth, hormones D3 (VD3) and 17β-estradiol (E2), and the genetic pathways modulated by them, are key targets for a better understanding pathogenesis of infectious respiratory diseases (IRD) such as tuberculosis (TB) and the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Currently, the world faces two major public health problems, the outbreak of COVID-19, accounting for more than 6 million so far, and TB, more than 1 million deaths per year. Both, although resulting from different pathogens, the Mtb and the SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are considered serious and epidemic. TB and COVID-19 present similar infection rates between men and women, however the number of complications and deaths resulting from the two infections is higher in men when compared to women in childbearing age, which may indicate a role of the sex hormone E2 in the context of these diseases. E2 and VD3 act upon key gene pathways as important immunomodulatory players and supporting molecules in IRDs. This review summarizes the main roles of these hormones (VD3 and E2) in modulating immune and inflammatory responses and their relationship with TB and COVID-19.","","","","f0713a3d36da02e45a6011a41236fc1a3fc385ec","","","","","","Vitamin D and estrogen steroid hormones and their immunogenetic roles in Infectious respiratory (TB and COVID-19) diseases","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0713a3d36da02e45a6011a41236fc1a3fc385ec","","2023"

"538",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","There has been considerable interest in dietary supplements in the last two decades. Companies are releasing new specifics at an alarming pace, while dietary supplements are one of the less-studied substances released for public consumption. However, access to state-of-the-art and high-throughput techniques, such as the ones used in omics, make it possible to check the impact of a substance on human transcriptome or proteome and provide answers to whether its use is reasonable and beneficial. In this review, the main domains of omics are briefly introduced. The review focuses on the three most widely used omics techniques: NGS, LC-MS, NMR, and their usefulness in studying dietary supplements. Examples of studies are described for some of the most commonly supplemented substances, such as vitamins: D, E, A, and plant extracts: resveratrol, green tea, ginseng, and curcumin extract. Techniques used in omics have proven to be useful in studying dietary supplements. NGS techniques are helpful in identifying pathways that change upon supplementation and determining polymorphisms or conditions that qualify for the necessity of a given supplementation. LC-MS techniques are used to establish the serum content of supplemented a compound and its effects on metabolites. Both LC-MS and NMR help establish the actual composition of a compound, its primary and secondary metabolites, and its potential toxicity. Moreover, NMR techniques determine what conditions affect the effectiveness of supplementation.","","","","52d7d053c5c278527e371e1fa5bd6841d141bc6f","","","","","","Omics as a Tool to Help Determine the Effectiveness of Supplements","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52d7d053c5c278527e371e1fa5bd6841d141bc6f","","2022"
"539",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Abstract Vitamin D is both a nutrient and a neurologic hormone that plays a critical role in modulating immune responses. While low levels of vitamin D are associated with increased susceptibility to infections and immune-related disorders, vitamin D supplementation has demonstrated immunomodulatory effects that can be protective against various diseases and infections. Vitamin D receptor is expressed in immune cells that have the ability to synthesise the active vitamin D metabolite. Thus, vitamin D acts in an autocrine manner in a local immunologic milieu in fighting against infections. Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are the new disciplines of nutritional science that explore the interaction between nutrients and genes using distinct approaches to decipher the mechanisms by which nutrients can influence disease development. Though molecular and observational studies have proved the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D, only very few studies have documented the molecular insights of vitamin D supplementation. Until recently, researchers have investigated only a few selected genes involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway that may influence the response to vitamin D supplementation and possibly disease risk. This review summarises the impact of vitamin D supplementation on immune markers from nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics perspective based on evidence collected through a structured search using PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct and Web of Science. The research gaps and shortcomings from the existing data and future research direction of vitamin D supplementation on various immune-related disorders are discussed.","","","","47b0919c5984328a33453cfc5096094794311144","","","","","","Vitamin D supplementation and immune-related markers: an update from nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic studies","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47b0919c5984328a33453cfc5096094794311144","","2022"

"545",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Vitamin D is truly unique-not a 'vital' amine in the true sense of the word, but rather a prohormone, which is produced in the skin during exposure to sunlight (UVB radiation at 290-315 nm) and which can also be obtained from food and from supplements. A high prevalence of low vitamin D status has been reported across the world in a wide range of population groups, and this includes communities living in low latitude areas despite the abundance of sunlight. It is accepted that vitamin D status is reflected by the level of the circulating metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), which is produced by hepatic hydroxylation of vitamin D, derived either from the skin from UV exposure or the gut from oral intake. Vitamin D has been associated with a wide range of health outcomes, but controversies remain as to their exact nature and extent and whether associations are in the causal pathway. In order to enable wider discussions on this nutrient, a 'Hot Topic' Vitamin D Workshop achieved funding from the UK Nutrition Research Partnership Medical Research Council call. The objectives of the workshop were (1) to elucidate the role of vitamin D in human health and (2) develop strategies to improve vitamin D status in the UK population.

The World Health Organization recommends social isolation as a way of minimizing the risk of contagion of the disease. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of older adults and to investigate how anthropometric, functional, and clinical aspects are associated with this process. Methods: Fifty healthy older adults were followed-up during 5 months. The subjects had their physical and mental health assessed during social isolation (pre-vaccine situation) and after the opening of stores and activities in the municipality (post-vaccine situation). Physical evaluation was performed using the 30-s sit and stand test. Participants’ mental health was assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Loneliness Index. In this methodological design, muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and loneliness index were subject to pre-post analyses. In addition, these variables were included as outcomes in linear regression models. Participants’ anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors were included as predictors of the statistical model. Results: Participants’ scores at baseline were consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscle strength of the subjects was appropriate to their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined, but with statistical significance only for depressive symptoms (p = 0.017, effect size of 0.11). Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained 42.8% of depressive symptoms, 22.3% of loneliness, and 30.2% of muscle strength in the elderly. Discussion/Conclusion: Older adults presented baseline scores consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscular strength of the subjects was appropriate for their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined. Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained a substantial part of the depressive symptoms, loneliness, and muscular strength in the elderly. Health care professionals should be aware of performing a wide assessment in subjects’ lives to ensure better health status.","","","","d2038006184f32b3e95496c695742268d55e7b9b","","","","","","Impact of Social Isolation on the Physical and Mental Health of Older Adults: A Follow-Up Study at the Apex of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2038006184f32b3e95496c695742268d55e7b9b","","2022"

In this review, we presented the relevant data which originated from trusted publishers regarding the practical benefits of functional foods (FFs) and their dietary sources, in addition to natural plant products, in viral respiratory and COVID-19 prevention and immune-boosting activities. As a result, FFs were confirmed to be functionally active ingredients for preventing COVID-19 and VRTIs. Furthermore, the antiviral activity and immunological effects of FFs against VRTIs and COVID-19 and their potential main mechanisms of action are also being reviewed. Therefore, to prevent COVID-19 and VRTIs, it is critical to identify controlling the activities and immune-enhancing functional food constituents as early as possible. We further aimed to summarize functional food constituents as a dietary supplement that aids in immune system boosting and may effectively reduce VRTIs and COVID-19 and promote therapeutic efficacy.","","","","d84e751b0e9d75de8a91a71daf3328c71140606f","","","","","","A Review on the Antiviral Activity of Functional Foods Against COVID-19 and Viral Respiratory Tract Infections","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d84e751b0e9d75de8a91a71daf3328c71140606f","","2022"
"548",":Paper","CC-BY","Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease associated with severe systemic inflammation. The optimal status of vitamins and microelements is considered crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system and necessary for successful recovery. Most patients with respiratory distress in COVID-19 are vitamin and microelement deficient, with vitamin D and Se deficiency being the most common. Anyway, various micronutrient supplements are widely and arbitrarily used for prevention or in the treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to summarise current knowledge about molecular and physiological mechanisms of vitamins (D, A, C, B6, B9 and B12) and microelements (Se, Zn, Cu and Fe) involved in the immune system regulation in consideration with COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as recent findings related to their usage and effects in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In the early course of the pandemic, several, mainly observational, studies reported an association of some micronutrients, such as vitamin C, D and Zn, with severity reduction and survival improvement. Still, emerging randomised controlled trials showed no effect of vitamin D on hospitalisation length and no effect of vitamin C and Zn on symptom reduction. Up to date, there is evidence neither for nor against the use of micronutrients in the treatment of COVID-19. The doses that exceed the recommended for the general population and age group should not be used, except in clinical trials. Benefits of supplementation are primarily expected in populations prone to micronutrient deficiencies, who are, as well, at a higher risk of worse outcomes in COVID-19.","","","","87009424f8ceb7085319a5d8e7dd5339788d96d7","","","","","","Vitamins, microelements and the immune system: current standpoint in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87009424f8ceb7085319a5d8e7dd5339788d96d7","","2022"

"551",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in Eastern Asia (Wuhan, China) in December 2019. The virus then spread to Europe and across all continents where it has led to higher mortality and morbidity, and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Recently, different vaccines have been produced and seem to be more or less effective in protecting from COVID-19. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS), an essential enzymatic cascade involved in maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance, is involved in the pathogenicity of COVID-19, since the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) acts as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in many human tissues and organs. In fact, the viral entrance promotes a downregulation of ACE2 followed by RAS balance dysregulation and an overactivation of the angiotensin II (Ang II)–angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) axis, which is characterized by a strong vasoconstriction and the induction of the profibrotic, proapoptotic and proinflammatory signalizations in the lungs and other organs. This mechanism features a massive cytokine storm, hypercoagulation, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent multiple organ damage. While all individuals are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the disease outcome and severity differ among people and countries and depend on a dual interaction between the virus and the affected host. Many studies have already pointed out the importance of host genetic polymorphisms (especially in the RAS) as well as other related factors such age, gender, lifestyle and habits and underlying pathologies or comorbidities (diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) that could render individuals at higher risk of infection and pathogenicity. In this review, we explore the correlation between all these risk factors as well as how and why they could account for severe post-COVID-19 complications.","","","","adc18d46f28a8618d579bb44828bc7cb15e3462e","","","","","","The Renin-Angiotensin System: A Key Role in SARS-CoV-2-Induced COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/adc18d46f28a8618d579bb44828bc7cb15e3462e","","2021"

New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to deaths as well as social and economic disruptions, is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Hence, only supportive care has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for now. Pharmacological agents used for the adjunctive treatment of COVID-19 following the current literature and clinical experiences include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malaria drugs, and other traditional or untraditional treatments. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs may have some negative effects and comorbidities. Moreover, the current data have indicated that the risk of drug-drug interactions may also be high in polypharmacy cases, especially in elderly people, some comorbidity situations, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is highly possible that these situations can not only increase the risk of drug-drug interactions but also increase the risk of food/nutrition-drug interactions and affect the nutritional status. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature. In this review, current information on the possible mechanisms as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of some pharmacological agents used in the treatment of COVID-19 and/or their secondary interactions with nutrition were evaluated and some future directions were given.","","","","c61266aee66e54df5f4f5c61444589c7d911b73a","","","","","","Emergent Drug and Nutrition Interactions in COVID-19: A Comprehensive Narrative Review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c61266aee66e54df5f4f5c61444589c7d911b73a","","2021"
"556",":Paper","CC-BY","The report from Amin et al concluded that the use of vitamin D supplementation for reduction of COVID-19 risks was not supported by the available data using Mendelian randomisation analysis (MRA) of UK Biobank data for Britons of European origin. Their study used Genomewide association [GWA] methodology to determine gene variant effects on baseline serum 25hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, which were then used as surrogates for longterm vitamin D status in their MRA, without data for vitamin D intakes or sunshine exposure. Though MRA studies using gene variant effects on serum 25(OH)D are common, the potential for error due to the nonlinear associations of biological and health effects with serum 25(OH) D concentrations (vitamin D status) is widely recognised. However, no satisfactory way has evolved for avoiding the confounding necessarily introduced by inclusion of the data lying on the upper or lower plateaus of those Sshaped relationships, but those were the datasets selected for analysis in this study. This matter is important since changes in the efficacy of vitamin D are not seen in subjects with 25(OH)D values along the lower or upper plateaus of the Sshaped association curves. And, in deficiency, no health benefits are seen with supplementation in subjects on the lower plateau unless their 25(OH)D concentrations are raised onto the steep part of the association curves, from ≤25 nmol/L (=UK deficiency) to at least 50 nmol/L for bone health but to higher values for effects with higher thresholds (eg, to 80–100 nmol/L for reducing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risks, respectively). Since gene variant effects on 25(OH)D values were reported as being much smaller than the 25–50–75 nmol/L (100%– 200%–300%) increases in 25(OH) D values such thresholds require, it is unlikely that MRAs of population data can detect health effects of variation in serum 25(OH)D in subjects with 25(OH)D values <25 nmol/L unless the 25(OH)D thresholds required to affect the outcome of interest are extremely low, especially in datasets selected for baseline vitamin D deficiency. In view of these analytical difficulties, it might be that avoiding data from the known associational plateaus for health effects of interest (ie, selecting datasets for subjects with baseline 25(OH)D values between 25 nmol/L and 110 nmol/L, even though those values only predict ~16% of current status) 7 might be helpful in examining longterm differences in vitamin D status as a potential determinant of health effects such as COVID-19 risks. Those ‘cutoffs’ for COVID-19 risks are suggested by the data analyses reported by Kaufman and colleagues for reductions in COVID-19 infection rates with increases in vitamin D status as assessed by 25(OH)D measurements made during the year before the pandemic began, using data available from a large representational American cohort study. There are many mechanistic reasons for suggesting that better vitamin D status should be protective against COVID-19 risks. Furthermore, a recent study of UK Biobank data suggests that those taking vitamin D supplements over time before the pandemic began had reduced COVID-19 risks in the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Might the authors, therefore, consider whether the modified approach to MRA for COVID-19 with genomewide association studies (GWAS) predicted variations in vitamin D status could prove useful?

"559",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","The COVID-19 pandemic has reached most of the countries worldwide causing death, which often results from an inflammatory storm associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This has prompted researchers to seek specific novel and definitive treatments urgently. In this context, it is interesting to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of existing pharmacological agents that could be useful. In this regard, vitamin D supplementation, particularly in individuals likely to be deficient, may be a promising option. Vitamin D is a hormone that modulates many of the same inflammatory and oxidative signaling pathways triggered during COVID-19. For example, vitamin D suppresses the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, which has a determining role in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response related to COVID-19. This paper analyzes the evidence that vitamin D supplementation might be a valuable preventive/therapeutic measure in groups at risk for or infected with COVID-19. It also discusses how clinical studies could be best designed to evaluate the possible advantages of vitamin D supplementation for the benefit of public health during the pandemic.","","","","799f8d39def90e89f2f4a5f105a2ac7d2a2462f9","","","","","","Vitamin D supplementation as a rational pharmacological approach in the COVID-19 pandemic","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/799f8d39def90e89f2f4a5f105a2ac7d2a2462f9","","2020"

"561",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","As the world's attention has been riveted upon the growing COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have written brief reports supporting the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19. The clear common thread among the top risk groups—vitamin D deficiency—may be being overlooked because of previous overstated claims of vitamin D benefits. However, the need to decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations is urgent. Early researchers reported three striking patterns. Firstly, the innate immune system is impaired by vitamin D deficiency, which would predispose sufferers to viral infections such as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the activity of the X-chromosome-linked “Renin-Angiotensin” System, making vitamin D deficient individuals (especially men) more susceptible to COVID-19's deadly “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system overreaction). Secondly, the groups who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 match those who are at highest risk for severe vitamin D deficiency. This includes the elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin is naturally rich in melanin (if living outside the tropics), those who avoid sun exposure for cultural and health reasons, those who live in institutions, the obese, and/or those who suffer with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. And thirdly, the pattern of geographical spread of COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin D deficiency. Both within the USA and throughout the world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin D deficiency rates. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and RSMLDS, with targeted Google searches providing additional sources. Although randomized controlled trial results may be available eventually, the correlational and causal study evidence supporting a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risks is already so strong that it supports action. The 141 author groups writing primarily about biological plausibility detailed how vitamin D deficiency can explain every risk factor and every complication of COVID-19, but agreed that other factors are undoubtedly at work. COVID-19 was compared with dengue fever, for which oral vitamin D supplements of 4,000 IU for 10 days were significantly more effective than 1,000 IU in reducing virus replication and controlling the “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible for fatalities. Among the 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found that serum vitamin D levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) and linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies). Two causal modeling studies and several analyses of variance strongly supported the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a causal, rather than a bystander, factor in COVID-19 outcomes. Three of the four studies whose findings opposed the hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions. The literature review also found that prophylactically correcting possible vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely safe. Widely recommending 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for all populations with limited ability to manufacture vitamin D from the sun has virtually no potential for harm and is reasonably likely to save many lives.","","","","bcd0328a0229d92828d62ff0be90de581e68b063","","","","","","A Basic Review of the Preliminary Evidence That COVID-19 Risk and Severity Is Increased in Vitamin D Deficiency","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcd0328a0229d92828d62ff0be90de581e68b063","","2020"

According to the latest literature, most patients with COVID‐19 have mild symptoms that do not require hospital admissions, and only a small percentage of those hospitalized require intensive care. In the intensive care unit (ICU), a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) assists the critical care team by formulating, executing, and monitoring the nutrition strategies and interventions to meet the unique requirements of extremely sick patients. However, because of the novelty of COVID‐19, the situation is fluid and guidelines continue to be developed and updated. This article discusses the interim guidelines available for the nutrition support of ICU COVID‐19 patients and the challenges the critical care team and RDN may face from a nutrition standpoint.","","","","5fbd8ba9aa168ba11eb93a7a2ab50a93ad0b229a","","","","","","Challenges of Maintaining Optimal Nutrition Status in COVID‐19 Patients in Intensive Care Settings","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fbd8ba9aa168ba11eb93a7a2ab50a93ad0b229a","","2020"
"564",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","The negative outcomes of COVID‐19 diseases respiratory distress (ARDS) and the damage to other organs are secondary to a “cytokine storm” and to the attendant oxidative stress. Active hydroxyl forms of vitamin D are anti‐inflammatory, induce antioxidative responses, and stimulate innate immunity against infectious agents. These properties are shared by calcitriol and the CYP11A1‐generated non‐calcemic hydroxyderivatives. They inhibit the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, downregulate NF‐κΒ, show inverse agonism on RORγ and counteract oxidative stress through the activation of NRF‐2. Therefore, a direct delivery of hydroxyderivatives of vitamin D deserves consideration in the treatment of COVID‐19 or ARDS of different aetiology. We also recommend treatment of COVID‐19 patients with high‐dose vitamin D since populations most vulnerable to this disease are likely vitamin D deficient and patients are already under supervision in the clinics. We hypothesize that different routes of delivery (oral and parenteral) will have different impact on the final outcome.","","","","6f441c5ae359b02765588759f48919f25fd74bf2","","","","","","COVID‐19 and Vitamin D: A lesson from the skin","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f441c5ae359b02765588759f48919f25fd74bf2","","2020"

Vitamins D2/D3 were discovered exactly a hundred years ago, and over the last 50 years vitamin D has been found to have many effects on virtually all human tissues and not just on bone health, while mechanisms affecting the actions of vitamin D at the cellular level are increasingly understood, but deficiency persists globally. Observational studies in humans have shown that better provision of vitamin D is strongly associated, dose-wise, with reductions in current and future health risks in line with the known actions of vitamin D. Randomised controlled trials, commonly accepted as providing a ‘gold standard’ for assessing the efficacy of new forms of treatment, have frequently failed to provide supportive evidence for the expected health benefits of supplementation. Such RCTs, however, have used designs evolved for testing drugs while vitamin D is a nutrient; the appreciation of this difference is critical to identifying health benefits from existing RCT data and for improving future RCT design. This report aims, therefore, to provide a brief overview of the evidence for a range of non-bony health benefits of vitamin D repletion; to discuss specific aspects of vitamin D biology that can confound RCT design and how to allow for them.","","","","73f3955e4f65729a5fcee70f95d85cb4c8aac524","","","","","","Why do so many trials of vitamin D supplementation fail?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73f3955e4f65729a5fcee70f95d85cb4c8aac524","","2020"

"570",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Cognitive decline is one of the greatest health threats of old age and the maintenance of optimal brain function across a lifespan remains a big challenge. The hippocampus is considered particularly vulnerable but there is cross-species consensus that its functional integrity benefits from the early and continuous exercise of demanding physical, social and mental activities, also referred to as environmental enrichment (EE). Here, we investigated the extent to which late-onset EE can improve the already-impaired cognitive abilities of lifelong deprived C57BL/6 mice and how it affects gene expression in the hippocampus. To this end, 5- and 24-month-old mice housed in standard cages (5mSC and 24mSC) and 24-month-old mice exposed to EE in the last 2 months of their life (24mEE) were subjected to a Barnes maze task followed by next-generation RNA sequencing of the hippocampal tissue. Our analyses showed that late-onset EE was able to restore deficits in spatial learning and short-term memory in 24-month-old mice. These positive cognitive effects were reflected by specific changes in the hippocampal transcriptome, where late-onset EE affected transcription much more than age (24mSC vs. 24mEE: 1311 DEGs, 24mSC vs. 5mSC: 860 DEGs). Remarkably, a small intersection of 72 age-related DEGs was counter-regulated by late-onset EE. Of these, Bcl3, Cttnbp2, Diexf, Esr2, Grb10, Il4ra, Inhba, Rras2, Rps6ka1 and Socs3 appear to be particularly relevant as key regulators involved in dendritic spine plasticity and in age-relevant molecular signaling cascades mediating senescence, insulin resistance, apoptosis and tissue regeneration. In summary, our observations suggest that the brains of aged mice in standard cage housing preserve a considerable degree of plasticity. Switching them to EE proved to be a promising and non-pharmacological intervention against cognitive decline.","","","","901fc3ace1f3763c1e547bf16c2d9c1198768956","","","","","","Restoring Age-Related Cognitive Decline through Environmental Enrichment: A Transcriptomic Approach","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/901fc3ace1f3763c1e547bf16c2d9c1198768956","","2022"

We found that MO3.13 cells changed their morphology when treated with both agents. Interestingly, CX-5461, but not PMA, induced noticeable changes in the integrity of the nucleoli. Then, we analyzed the p53 transcriptional activity in MO3.13 cells and found that it was increased in both cell populations, but particularly in cells treated with PMA. Interestingly, this high p53 transcriptional activity in PMA-treated cells coincided with a lower level of an unmodified (non-phosphorylated) form of this protein. Since morphological changes in MO3.13 cells after PMA and CX-5461 treatment were evident, suggesting that cells were induced to differentiate, we performed RNA-seq analysis of PMA-treated cells, to reveal the direction of alterations in gene expression. The analysis showed that the largest group of upregulated genes consisted of those involved in myogenesis and K-RAS signaling, rather than those associated with oligodendrocyte lineage progression.","","","","60c067b8c51665f653a7005e356b1eeafb44ba4f","","","","","","RNA-Seq Transcriptome Analysis of Differentiated Human Oligodendrocytic MO3.13 Cells Shows Upregulation of Genes Involved in Myogenesis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60c067b8c51665f653a7005e356b1eeafb44ba4f","","2022"

Life-long myelination is essential for learning and to replace myelin lost in age-related pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as white matter pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, there is considerable myelin loss in the aging brain, which is accelerated in AD and underpins the failure of remyelination in secondary progressive MS. An important factor in age-related myelin loss is a marked decrease in the regenerative capacity of OPCs.

"575",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Since the optic nerve is one of the most myelinated tracts in the central nervous system (CNS), many myelin diseases affect the visual system. In this sense, our laboratory has recently reported that the GTPases R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for oligodendrocyte survival and maturation. Hypomyelination produced by the absence of one or both proteins triggers axonal degeneration and loss of visual and motor function. However, little is known about R-Ras specificity and other possible roles that they could play in the CNS. In this work, we describe how a lack of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 could not be compensated by increased expression of the closely related R-Ras3 or classical Ras. We further studied R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 expression within different CNS anatomical regions, finding that both were more abundant in less-myelinated regions, suggesting their expression in non-oligodendroglial cells. Finally, using confocal immunostaining colocalization, we report for the first time that R-Ras2 is specifically expressed in neurons. Neither microglia nor astrocytes expressed R-Ras1 or R-Ras2. These results open a new avenue for the study of neuronal R-Ras2’s contribution to the process of myelination.","","","","50eeabbdf2ee62f84a7d455afff01d762a692d1a","","","","","","R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 Expression in Anatomical Regions and Cell Types of the Central Nervous System","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50eeabbdf2ee62f84a7d455afff01d762a692d1a","","2022"

"578",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Fast synaptic transmission in vertebrates is critically dependent on myelin for insulation and metabolic support. Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes (OLs) that maintain multilayered membrane compartments that wrap around axonal fibers. Alterations in myelination can therefore lead to severe pathologies such as multiple sclerosis. Given that hypomyelination disorders have complex etiologies, reproducing clinical symptoms of myelin diseases from a neurological perspective in animal models has been difficult. We recently reported that R‐Ras1−/− and/or R‐Ras2−/− mice, which lack GTPases essential for OL survival and differentiation processes, present different degrees of hypomyelination in the central nervous system with a compounded hypomyelination in double knockout (DKO) mice. Here, we discovered that the loss of R‐Ras1 and/or R‐Ras2 function is associated with aberrant myelinated axons with increased numbers of mitochondria, and a disrupted mitochondrial respiration that leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels. Consequently, aberrant myelinated axons are thinner with cytoskeletal phosphorylation patterns typical of axonal degeneration processes, characteristic of myelin diseases. Although we observed different levels of hypomyelination in a single mutant mouse, the combined loss of function in DKO mice lead to a compromised axonal integrity, triggering the loss of visual function. Our findings demonstrate that the loss of R‐Ras function reproduces several characteristics of hypomyelinating diseases, and we therefore propose that R‐Ras1−/− and R‐Ras2−/− neurological models are valuable approaches for the study of these myelin pathologies.","","","","525b4a0c7afd350e806912775fc276580cdc1db9","","","","","","Absence of R‐Ras1 and R‐Ras2 causes mitochondrial alterations that trigger axonal degeneration in a hypomyelinating disease model","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/525b4a0c7afd350e806912775fc276580cdc1db9","","2020"

From oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, myelination is a highly complex process that involves many elements of cellular signaling, yet many of the mechanisms that coordinate it, remain unknown. In this review, we will focus on the three major pathways involved in myelination (PI3K/Akt/mTOR, ERK1/2-MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin) and recent advances describing the crosstalk elements which help to regulate them.

The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HULC has been implicated in GBM, but the molecular mechanism is uncertain. This study used quantitative proteomic analysis for global identification of HULC-regulated proteins in glioblastoma cells and identification of potential biomarkers. Materials and Methods qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of HULC in U87 cells stably transfected with HULC or an empty vector (control). The CCK-8 assay, transwell assay, and wound-scratch assay were used to measure cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Quantitative proteomics using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Screened proteins were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and Western blotting. Results Overexpression of HULC led to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. HULC overexpression also led to significant upregulation of 37 proteins and downregulation of 78 proteins. Bioinformatics analysis indicated these proteins had roles in cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. PRM results of 8 of these proteins (PTK2, TNC, ITGAV, LASP1, MAPK14, ITGA1, GNA13, RRAS) were consistent with the LC-MS/MS and Western blotting results. Conclusion The results of present study suggest that lncRNA HULC promotes GBM cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by regulating RRAS expression, suggesting that RRAS may be a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for this cancer.","","","","895e65538dbba48e84113d173bb8035451d75b2b","","","","","","Quantitative Proteomics Analysis Indicates That Upregulation of lncRNA HULC Promotes Pathogenesis of Glioblastoma Cells","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/895e65538dbba48e84113d173bb8035451d75b2b","","2020"

All individuals and their spouses received three assessments of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-item (CESD-10) scale in 2011, 2013, and 2015. According to the diagnostic algorithm recommended by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019, we evaluated the incidence of possible sarcopenia in individuals in 2015. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify a longitudinal depression trajectory of individuals and their spouses during a 4-year follow-up. Subsequently, we assessed the relationship between possible sarcopenia and depression trajectory using three generalized additive models. Results In 2015, 24.87% (195/784) of individuals were diagnosed with possible sarcopenia. LCA identified five depression trajectories: a persistently high risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (reference; class 1 = 34 [4.3%]); a persistently low risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (class 2 = 526 [67.1%]); a high risk of depression in individuals and a low risk of depression in spouses (class 3 = 46 [5.9%]); a low risk of depression in individuals and a high risk of depression in spouses (class 4 = 116 [14.8%]); and a reduced risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (class 5 = 62 [7.9%]). The highest incidence of possible sarcopenia was shown in class 1, followed by classes 3 and 5. Classes 2 (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20–0.97) and 4 (adjusted RR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.17–0.96) had a significantly lower incidence of possible sarcopenia than class 1. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the incidence of possible sarcopenia in class 4 was obviously higher in women (38.89%) than in men (18.4%). Conclusions Our study indicates a persistently high risk of depression in individuals to develop possible sarcopenia. In addition, a persistently high risk of depression in intimate partners potentially increases the risk of possible new sarcopenia, especially in female individuals who are at low risk of depression.","","","","65b7976d6952b3737d2268a41c16bbdeb15ca1ba","","","","","","The longitudinal association between possible new sarcopenia and the depression trajectory of individuals and their intimate partners","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65b7976d6952b3737d2268a41c16bbdeb15ca1ba","","2022"

Despite the progress in the treatment of localized prostate cancer, there is still lack of effective therapies for the advanced forms of the disease. Most patients with advanced prostate cancer become resistant to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which remains the main therapeutic option in this setting, and progress to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Current therapies for prostate cancer preferentially target proliferating, partially differentiated, and AR-dependent cancer cells that constitute the bulk of the tumor mass. However, the subpopulation of tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating stem-like cancer cells is virtually resistant to the standard treatments causing tumor relapse at the primary or metastatic sites. Understanding the pathways controlling the establishment, expansion and maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation is an important step toward the development of more effective treatment for prostate cancer, which might enable ablation or exhaustion of CSCs and prevent treatment resistance and disease recurrence. In this review, we focus on the impact of transcriptional regulators on phenotypic reprogramming of prostate CSCs and provide examples supporting the possibility of inhibiting maintenance and expansion of the CSC pool in human prostate cancer along with the currently available methodological approaches. Transcription factors are key elements for instructing specific transcriptional programs and inducing CSC-associated phenotypic changes implicated in disease progression and treatment resistance. Recent studies have shown that interfering with these processes causes exhaustion of CSCs with loss of self-renewal and tumorigenic capability in prostate cancer models. Targeting key transcriptional regulators in prostate CSCs is a valid therapeutic strategy waiting to be tested in clinical trials.","","","","3bc04a174a13db3fe0c2f320e8ab01bf12f5e6af","","","","","","Transcriptional Reprogramming and Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Targeting Prostate Cancer Stem Cells","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bc04a174a13db3fe0c2f320e8ab01bf12f5e6af","","2019"
"589",":Paper","CC-BY","Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer death in men, worldwide. Mortality is highly related to metastasis and hormone resistance, but the molecular underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have studied the presence and role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the Epithelial–Mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa, using both in vitro and in vivo models, thereby providing evidence that the stemness–mesenchymal axis seems to be a critical process related to relapse, metastasis and resistance. These are complex and related processes that involve a cooperative action of different cancer cell subpopulations, in which CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells (MCCs) would be responsible for invading, colonizing pre-metastatic niches, initiating metastasis and an evading treatments response. Manipulating the stemness–EMT axis genes on the androgen receptor (AR) may shed some light on the effect of this axis on metastasis and castration resistance in PCa. It is suggested that the EMT gene SNAI2/Slug up regulates the stemness gene Sox2, and vice versa, inducing AR expression, promoting metastasis and castration resistance. This approach will provide new sight about the role of the stemness–mesenchymal axis in the metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa and their potential control, contributing to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic and castration-resistant PCa.","","","","d0077c17cef9560b035930645fece7c8370d38c0","","","","","","Cancer Stemness/Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0077c17cef9560b035930645fece7c8370d38c0","","2022"

"593",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Simple Summary In recent years, immunotherapy has shown great advancement, becoming a powerful tool to combat cancer. In this context, the use of biologically derived vesicles has also acquired importance for cancer immunotherapy. Extracellular vesicles are thus proposed to transport molecules able to trigger an immune response and thus fight cancer cells. As a particular immunotherapeutic approach, a new technique also consists in the exploitation of extracellular vesicles as new cancer vaccines. The present review provides basic notions on cancer immunotherapy and describes several clinical trials in which therapeutic anticancer vaccines are tested. In particular, the potential of extracellular vesicles-based therapeutic vaccines in the treatment of cancer patients is highlighted, even with advanced stage-cancer. A focus on the clinical studies, already completed or still in progress, is offered and a systematic collection and reorganization of the present literature on this topic is proposed to the reader. Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural particles formed by the lipid bilayer and released from almost all cell types to the extracellular environment both under physiological conditions and in presence of a disease. EVs are involved in many biological processes including intercellular communication, acting as natural carriers in the transfer of various biomolecules such as DNA, various RNA types, proteins and different phospholipids. Thanks to their transfer and targeting abilities, they can be employed in drug and gene delivery and have been proposed for the treatment of different diseases, including cancer. Recently, the use of EVs as biological carriers has also been extended to cancer immunotherapy. This new technique of cancer treatment involves the use of EVs to transport molecules capable of triggering an immune response to damage cancer cells. Several studies have analyzed the possibility of using EVs in new cancer vaccines, which represent a particular form of immunotherapy. In the literature there are only few publications that systematically group and collectively discuss these studies. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to illustrate and give a partial reorganization to what has been produced in the literature so far. We provide basic notions on cancer immunotherapy and describe some clinical trials in which therapeutic cancer vaccines are tested. We thus focus attention on the potential of EV-based therapeutic vaccines in the treatment of cancer patients, overviewing the clinically relevant trials, completed or still in progress, which open up new perspectives in the fight against cancer.","","","","22024d99202b723c97f1b8323c7cd8637de8106b","","","","","","Extracellular Vesicles and Their Current Role in Cancer Immunotherapy","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22024d99202b723c97f1b8323c7cd8637de8106b","","2021"

While cancer stem cells (CSCs) may play a vital role in oncogenesis and development of lung cancer, mechanisms underlying CSCs self‐renewal remain less clear. In the present study, we constructed a clinically relevant CSCs enrichment recognition model and evaluated the potential functions of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways in lung cancer via bioinformatic analysis, providing the basis for in depth mechanistic inquisition. Experimentally, we confirmed that PI3K/AKT pathway predominantly promotes proliferation through anti-apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, while MAPK/ERK pathway has an overwhelming superiority in regulating the proliferation in lung CSCs. Further, utilizing stemness score model, LLC-Symmetric Division (LLC-SD) cells and mouse orthotopic lung transplantation model, we elucidated an intricate cross-talk between the oncogenic pathway and the stem cell reprograming pathway that impact stem cell characteristics as well as cancer biology features of lung CSCs both in vitro and in vivo.

Recent studies have suggested that prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) are pivotal regulators in the establishment of castration resistance. The nanog homeobox (NANOG) and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD) signaling pathways are involved in several cancer stem cells but are not involved in PCSCs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of NANOG on the proliferation of PCSCs regulated by the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway. Methods In this study, we used flow cytometry to isolate CD44+/CD133+/NANOG+ PCSCs from DU145 prostate cancer cells. Then we used short hairpin RNA to silence NANOG and observed the biological behavior and the TGF-β1/SMAD signal of PCSCs. Results NANOG decreased PCSC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and blocked cell cycling at G0/G1. Furthermore, reduction in the TGF-β1, p15, and p-SMAD2 expression was observed.

The clear cell subtype of renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) constitutes the great majority of kidney cancer. Metastatic ccRCC portends a very poor outcome with no effective treatment available. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the US. Despite recent advances in selective kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies, the rate of developing new treatment from bench to bedside is slow. A time-consuming step is at the animal drug testing stage, in which the mouse model is the gold standard. In the pursuit to streamline the in vivo cancer biology research and drug development, we explored the feasibility of the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to establish xenografts. The CAM model greatly shortens the time of tumor growth and lowers the cost comparing to immunocompromised mice. We generated CAM xenografts from ccRCC, bladder and prostate cancer, with established cancer cell lines and freshly isolated patient-derived tissues, either as primary tumor cells or small pieces of tumors. The successful CAM engraftment rate from the different tumor sources is 70% or above. Using our previously established metastatic ccRCC mouse model, we showed that the CAM xenograft maintains the same tumor growth pattern and metastatic behavior as observed in mice. Taken together, CAM can serve as a valuable platform to establish new patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to study tumor biology, thus accelerating the development of individualized treatment to halt the deadly metastatic stage of cancer.","","","","a3363f54748321316dfd1a0a7990016133f0290d","","","","","","Establishment of xenografts of urological cancers on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to study metastasis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3363f54748321316dfd1a0a7990016133f0290d","","2019"

Identifying molecular pathways underlying DTX resistance is critical for developing novel combinatorial therapies to prevent or reverse this resistance. To identify transcriptomic signatures associated with acquisition of chemoresistance we profiled gene expression in DTX-sensitive and -resistant mCRPC cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). PC3 and DU145 cells were selected for DTX resistance and this phenotype was validated by immunoblotting using DTX resistance markers (e.g. clusterin, ABCB1/P-gp, and LEDGF/p75). Overlapping genes differentially regulated in the DTX-sensitive and -resistant cells were ranked by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and validated to correlate transcript with protein expression. GSEA revealed that genes associated with cancer stem cells (CSC) (e.g., NES, TSPAN8, DPPP, DNAJC12, and MYC) were highly ranked and comprised 70% of the top 25 genes differentially upregulated in the DTX-resistant cells. Established markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSCs were used to evaluate the stemness of adherent DTX-resistant cells (2D cultures) and tumorspheres (3D cultures). Increased formation and frequency of cells expressing CSC markers were detected in DTX-resistant cells. DU145-DR cells showed a 2-fold increase in tumorsphere formation and increased DTX resistance compared to DU145-DR 2D cultures. These results demonstrate the induction of a transcriptomic program associated with stemness in mCRPC cells selected for DTX resistance, and strengthen the emerging body of evidence implicating CSCs in this process. In addition, they provide additional candidate genes and molecular pathways for potential therapeutic targeting to overcome DTX resistance.","","","","7ecf43ca2161c0c36e7c823143f96eda67530952","","","","","","RNA sequencing reveals upregulation of a transcriptomic program associated with stemness in metastatic prostate cancer cells selected for taxane resistance","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ecf43ca2161c0c36e7c823143f96eda67530952","","2018"
"598",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Combining the idea of signcryption, a proxy re-signcryption scheme based on identity is proposed. This scheme is a primitive that allows a semi-trusted entity called the “proxy” to convert the signcryption addressed to a “delegator” to those that can be de-signcrypted by a “delegatee”, by using some special information given by the delegator, called “rekey”. In the scheme, the proxy is not allowed to know the secret keys of the delegator or the delegatee, or the plaintext during the conversion. The proxy and delegatee, however, are not allowed to collude with each other. Compared to the existing scheme, the proxy re-signcryption proposed by us implements the full conversion—a signcryption under the keys for two parties can be transferred to another signcryption under another different two keys, and the verification of the signcryption can be progressed without the participation of plaintext. Meanwhile, the security of the scheme is proved under the ROM. Finally, we give the analysis of the efficiency, performance and the function of the scheme, which proves that the function of our scheme is stronger and more perfect than that of the existing schemes.","","","","19c89b016362c80b276a4f05ccb3f80b236eddb9","","","","","","ID-based proxy re-signcryption scheme","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19c89b016362c80b276a4f05ccb3f80b236eddb9","","2011"

As the IoT devices in the smart grid ecosystem generate a gigantic amount of data that needs to be stored and managed in the cloud server. On the other hand, the stored data in the cloud server can be accessible to a number of data users, therefore the data need authenticity and secrecy. Here, to fulfill the security requirements of such type of communication, signcryption with proxy re-encryption technique is the most suitable option where a semi-trusted third party can alter a ciphertext that has been encrypted for one user into another ciphertext without seeing the original content of the message. However, the existing signcryption with proxy re-encryption schemes for the smart grid environment is suffering from more bandwidth space and greater computational time requirements. Thus, in this paper, we propose a lightweight certificate-based signcryption with a proxy re-encryption (CBSRE) scheme for smart grid based-IoT devices with the intention of reducing the computational and communicational costs. For the security and efficiency of the proposed CBSRE scheme, we used a hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem that uses small parameters with a key size of 80-bits. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides the security requirements of confidentiality (IND-CBSRE-CCA2-I and IND-CBSRE-CCA2-II), unforgeability (EUF-CBSRE-CMA-I and EUF-CBSRE-CMA-II) and forward secrecy.

The collection and transmission of such data raises security concerns. Hence, its vital to secure ESP’s access to a customer’s data. In perspective of this, we introduce a data access control scheme which is suitable for smart grids with secure customer data access. In our scheme, the customer is a data owner while an ESP or other third party stakeholder (TPS) is the data user. A data user can have secure access to a customer’s data via a gateway device such as energy service interface (ESI). The ESI fits in as proxy that re-encrypts data for authorized data users based on the delegation command from the data owner. Here, ESI is unable to acquire plaintext information on the data. Moreover, only authorized data users are eligible for decrypting and verifying the integrity and authentication of data. We achieve the data access control via a certificateless signcryption with proxy re-encryption (CLSPRE) scheme. Detailed security analysis shows that our CLSPRE scheme is secure in the random oracle model (ROM).

This allows users to store signed and encrypted data in the cloud, where the cloud server provider is able to check the authentication but not to derive the content of the message.

"608",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Effective software cost estimation significantly contributes to decision-making. The rising trend of using nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms has been seen in software cost estimation problems. The constructive cost model (COCOMO) method is a well-known regression-based algorithmic technique for estimating software costs. The limitation of the COCOMO models is that the values of these coefficients are constant for similar kinds of projects whereas, in reality, these parameters vary from one organization to another organization. Therefore, for accurate estimation, it is necessary to fine-tune the coefficients. The research community is now examining deep learning (DL) as a forward-looking solution to improve cost estimation. Although deep learning architectures provide some improvements over existing flat technologies, they also have some shortcomings, such as large training delays, over-fitting, and under-fitting. Deep learning models usually require fine-tuning to a large number of parameters. The meta-heuristic algorithm supports finding a good optimal solution at a reasonable computational cost. Additionally, heuristic approaches allow for the location of an optimum solution. So, it can be used with deep neural networks to minimize training delays. The hybrid of ant colony optimization with BAT (HACO-BA) algorithm is a hybrid optimization technique that combines the most common global optimum search technique for ant colonies (ACO) in association with one of the newest search techniques called the BAT algorithm (BA). This technology supports the solution of multivariable problems and has been applied to the optimization of a large number of engineering problems. This work will perform a two-fold assessment of algorithms: (i) comparing the efficacy of ACO, BA, and HACO-BA in optimizing COCOMO II coefficients; and (ii) using HACO-BA algorithms to optimize and improve the deep learning training process. The experimental results show that the hybrid HACO-BA performs better as compared to ACO and BA for tuning COCOMO II. HACO-BA also performs better in the optimization of DNN in terms of execution time and accuracy. The process is executed upto 100 epochs, and the accuracy achieved by the proposed DNN approach is almost 98% while NN achieved accuracy of up to 85% on the same datasets.","","","","bcbdd03b7f566469ff848a6b34973ddc8194f717","","","","","","Optimizing Deep Learning Model for Software Cost Estimation Using Hybrid Meta-Heuristic Algorithmic Approach","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcbdd03b7f566469ff848a6b34973ddc8194f717","","2022"

Since underwater information is very sensitive and unique, the authentication of users is very important to access the data and information. UWSNs have unique communication and computation needs that are not met by the existing digital signature techniques. As a result, a lightweight signature scheme is required to meet the communication and computation requirements. In this research, we present a Certificateless Online/Offline Signature (COOS) mechanism for UWSNs. The proposed scheme is based on the concept of a hyperelliptic curves cryptosystem, which offers the same degree of security as RSA, bilinear pairing, and elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) but with a smaller key size. In addition, the proposed scheme was proven secure in the random oracle model under the hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. A security analysis was also carried out, as well as comparisons with appropriate current online/offline signature schemes. The comparison demonstrated that the proposed scheme is superior to the existing schemes in terms of both security and efficiency. Additionally, we also employed the fuzzy-based Evaluation-based Distance from Average Solutions (EDAS) technique to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","","","","e86a76d60fc3b625e33eb31b099c2c0d7c90622d","","","","","","A Computationally Efficient Online/Offline Signature Scheme for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e86a76d60fc3b625e33eb31b099c2c0d7c90622d","","2022"

Thus, the privacy and security of data are of utmost importance to all of its users regardless of the nature of the data being stored. In cloud computing environments, it is especially critical because data is stored in various locations, even around the world, and users do not have any physical access to their sensitive data. Therefore, we need certain data protection techniques to protect the sensitive data that is outsourced over the cloud. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to illustrate all the data protection techniques that protect sensitive data outsourced over cloud storage. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to synthesize, classify, and identify important studies in the field of study. Accordingly, an evidence-based approach is used in this study. Preliminary results are based on answers to four research questions. Out of 493 research articles, 52 studies were selected. 52 papers use different data protection techniques, which can be divided into two main categories, namely noncryptographic techniques and cryptographic techniques. Noncryptographic techniques consist of data splitting, data anonymization, and steganographic techniques, whereas cryptographic techniques consist of encryption, searchable encryption, homomorphic encryption, and signcryption. In this work, we compare all of these techniques in terms of data protection accuracy, overhead, and operations on masked data. Finally, we discuss the future research challenges facing the implementation of these techniques.","","","","7b6554b29f54827ed4a11acbc832143adcef7260","","","","","","The Rise of Cloud Computing: Data Protection, Privacy, and Open Research Challenges—A Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b6554b29f54827ed4a11acbc832143adcef7260","","2022"

The vitals of the patient signs by the sensors are highly sensitive, secret, and vulnerable to numerous adversarial attacks. Since WBANs is a real-world application of the healthcare system, it’s vital to ensure that the data acquired by the WBANs sensors is secure and not accessible to unauthorized parties or security hazards. As a result, effective signcryption security solutions are required for the WBANs’ success and widespread use. Over the last two decades, researchers have proposed a slew of signcryption security solutions to achieve this goal. The lack of a clear and unified study in terms of signcryption solutions can offer a bird’s eye view of WBANs. Based on the most recent signcryption papers, we analyzed WBAN’s communication architecture, security requirements, and the primary problems in WBANs to meet the aforementioned objectives. This survey also includes the most up to date signcryption security techniques in WBANs environments. By identifying and comparing all available signcryption techniques in the WBANs sector, the study will aid the academic community in understanding security problems and causes. The goal of this survey is to provide a comparative review of the existing signcryption security solutions and to analyze the previously indicated solution given for WBANs. A multi-criteria decision-making approach is used for a comparative examination of the existing signcryption solutions. Furthermore, the survey also highlights some of the public research issues that researchers must face to develop the security features of WBANs.","","","","e3d2de2d40822e3f65e3ebd9d57166cccd7fff01","","","","","","A Comprehensive Survey on Signcryption Security Mechanisms in Wireless Body Area Networks","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3d2de2d40822e3f65e3ebd9d57166cccd7fff01","","2022"

So has blockchain technology. The hierarchical electric power grid has been shifting from a centralized structure to a decentralized structure to achieve higher flexibility and stability, and blockchain technology has been widely adopted in the energy sector to deal with grid management, billing, metering, and so on, because of its nature of decentralization. Here, the aim is to provide a multi‐dimensional review on the technological advances of the blockchain in smart grids. Its corresponding applications based on these advances, including company projects and use cases, are summarized. Furthermore, the security threat issues in smart grids, Ethereum Virtual Machine (i.e. the operating environment of consensus mechanisms), and smart contracts are analysed, with a brief conclusion to manifest the prior tasks in building secure blockchain‐based infrastructures in smart grids. As such, the challenges and features of different protocols and their applicability in each use case are identified to provide an insightful guide for future research studies.","","","","cf02635993caca98c8756c4b0fa476d3c2b7b68a","","","","","","A survey on blockchain‐enabled smart grids: Advances, applications and challenges","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf02635993caca98c8756c4b0fa476d3c2b7b68a","","2021"

These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT’s communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user’s physical condition, which can be detrimental to users’ finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources. Finally, we validate the security of the designed scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks using the AVISPA tool.","","","","58585cb32c6a6f119320cc3274bc5f34038076bd","","","","","","Securing NDN-Based Internet of Health Things through Cost-Effective Signcryption Scheme","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58585cb32c6a6f119320cc3274bc5f34038076bd","","2021"

NDN is well suited for Internet of Things (IoT) which possesses massive applications that dominate the Internet today. It intends to provide named-based routing, in-networking caching, built-in mobility and multicast support as part of its design which leads to a substantial improvement in content delivery/retrieval. Though, this new architecture aches from some new challenges in terms of security. In this article, we seek our attention towards Content Poisoning Attack (CPA). The purpose of CPA is to inject poisoned content with an invalid signature into the NDN-based IoT networks. Unfortunately, none of the existing proposals work effectively when malicious attackers compromise the caches of NDN routers. To prevent this, we proposed a certificateless signature scheme for the preservation of CPA in NDN-based IoT networks. The proposed scheme is formally secure under the security hardness of Hyperelliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (HCDLP) with a security simulation/validation in “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA).” Besides, the formal proof we also compared the designed scheme with some existing solutions to show the cost-efficiency in terms of communication overhead and computation cost.

These smart objects sense and produce a huge amount of data for distribution. The current hostcentric networking paradigm is not that scalable to provide a suitable solution to the idea of IoT. For scalable connectivity and efficient distribution, Named Data Networking (NDN) has been envisioned as a promising solution for future internet architecture. On the other hand, the significant issues regarding the adaptation of NDN with IoT possess security concerns such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and forward secrecy. As IoT is a heterogeneous environment, it demands a different type of security, according to the environmental situation such as public key infrastructure (PKI), identity-based cryptosystem (IBC), and certificateless cryptosystem (CLC). This paper presents a new concept of CLC to IBC heterogeneous generalized signcryption for the first time to fulfil the prime security requirements of NDN-based IoT. The proposed scheme provides the security properties according to situational needs without disturbing the structural policy of NDN. Considering the resource-constrained nature of IoT, we used a lightweight type of elliptic curve called the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem which offers the same level of security as that of bilinear pairing and an elliptic curve cryptosystem using a minimum key size. Further, we compare the proposed scheme with recently proposed identity-based as well as certificateless generalized signcryption schemes, and the results give satisfactory outputs in terms of computational and communication resources. Furthermore, we simulate the proposed scheme with Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA), and the results show that our scheme is valid and safe. Additionally, we provide a practical scenario of the proposed on NDN with an IoT-based smart city.","","","","f055145eb9dd3453111cfbaa2e3c3101a85440bf","","","","","","A Lightweight Nature Heterogeneous Generalized Signcryption (HGSC) Scheme for Named Data Networking-Enabled Internet of Things","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f055145eb9dd3453111cfbaa2e3c3101a85440bf","","2020"

"626",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","In a fog-enabled IoT environment, a fog node is regarded as the proxy between end users and cloud servers to reduce the latency of data transmission, so as to fulfill the requirement of more real-time applications. A data storage scheme utilizing fog computing architecture allows a user to share cloud data with other users via the assistance of fog nodes. In particular, a fog node obtaining a re-encryption key of the data owner is able to convert a cloud ciphertext into the one which is decryptable by another designated user. In such a scheme, a proxy should not learn any information about the plaintext during the transmission and re-encryption processes. In 2020, an ID-based data storage scheme utilizing anonymous key generation in fog computing was proposed by some researchers. Although their protocol is provably secure in a proof model of random oracles, we will point out that there are some security flaws inherited in their protocol. On the basis of their work, we further present an improved variant, which not only eliminates their security weaknesses, but also preserves the functionalities of anonymous key generation and user revocation mechanism.

"631",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Proxy re-encryption (PRE) schemes, which nicely solve the problem of delegating decryption rights, enable a semi-trusted proxy to transform a ciphertext encrypted under one key into a ciphertext of the same message under another arbitrary key. For a long time, the semantic security of PREs is quite similar to that of public key encryption (PKE) schemes. Cohen first pointed out the insufficiency of the security under chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) of PREs in PKC 2019, and proposed a strictly stronger security notion, named security under honest re-encryption attacks (HRA), of PREs. Surprisingly, a few PREs satisfy the stronger HRA security and almost all of them are paring-based till now. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first detailed construction of HRA secure single-hop PREs based on standard LWE problems with comparably small and polynomially-bounded parameters in this paper. Combing known reductions, the HRA security of our PREs could also be guaranteed by the worst-case basic lattice problems (e.g. SIVPγ). Meanwhile, our single-hop PRE schemes are also key-private, which means that the implicit identities of a re-encryption key will not be revealed even in the case of a proxy colluding with some corrupted users. Some discussions about key-privacy of multi-hop PREs are also proposed, which indicates that several constructions of multi-hop PREs do not satisfy their key-privacy definitions.","","","","9e6ebd829386037d869ecd9c71149e2773b0d6ee","","","","","","PREs with HRA Security and Key Privacy Based on Standard LWE Assumptions","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e6ebd829386037d869ecd9c71149e2773b0d6ee","","2021"

However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumers’ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumers’ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy.

The new revolution of technology will also bring new challenges to data security, particularly data confidentiality. As a promising encryption method for supporting fine-grained access control, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is widely given attention by the academia and industry. However, most existing schemes suffer from the efficiency problem limiting its deployment for the cloud-assisted smart grid, especially for resource-limited users. To address this problem, this paper proposes two efficient pairing-free ciphertext-policy attribute-based schemes that eliminate the computation-intensive bilinear pairing operation. The basic scheme only uses some simple scalar multiplications based on elliptic curves, and the enhanced scheme provides an important usability feature, namely the users and attributes revocation. The security of the proposed schemes is reduced to the elliptic curve decisional Diffie-Hellman problem.

The traditional WPT circuits are based on switches, which do require a control circuit for timing and have low data encryption factor. By adopting the memristive Chua‘s circuit with the chaotic behaviour characteristic, it is possible to create a symmetrical dual-key cryptography. Furthermore, in this innovative solution, the high inductance value of the traditional Chua circuit can be further reduced by using the dynamic effects of the coils flux linkage. The simulation results exhibit the dual-scroll attractors phase portrait, which is available for encryption features.

"640",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) community is concerned about the security of wireless communications between interconnected industries and autonomous systems. Providing a cyber-security framework for the IIoT offers a thorough comprehension of the whole spectrum of securing interconnected industries, from the edge to the cloud. Several signcryption schemes based on either identity-based or certificateless configurations are available in the literature to address the IIoT’s security concerns. Due to the identity-based/certificateless nature of the available signcryption schemes, however, issues such as key escrow and partial private key distribution occur. To address these difficulties, we propose a Certificate-Based Signcryption (CBS) solution for IIoT in this article. Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptosystem (HECC), a light-weight version of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), was employed to construct the proposed scheme, which offers security and cost-efficiency. The HECC utilizes 80-bit keys with fewer parameters than the ECC and Bilinear Pairing (BP). The comparison of performance in terms of computation and communication costs reveals that the proposed scheme provides robust security with minimal communication and communication costs. Moreover, we used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) to assess the security toughness, and the results show that the proposed scheme is secure.","","","","018e933015320e427d83d8caaa3fa45980b9f21b","","","","","","Certificate-Based Signcryption Scheme for Securing Wireless Communication in Industrial Internet of Things","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/018e933015320e427d83d8caaa3fa45980b9f21b","","2022"

Therefore, we apply a number of optimization methods to minimize the size of the stored data and/or the cycle count for the computation of the algorithms.

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) on a device represent a low cost primitive exploiting the unique random patterns in the device and have been already applied in a multitude of applications for secure key generation and key agreement in order to avoid an attacker to take over the identity of a tampered device, whose key material has been extracted. This paper shows that the key agreement scheme of a recently proposed PUF based protocol, presented by Chatterjee et al., for Internet of Things (IoT) is vulnerable for man-in-the-middle, impersonation, and replay attacks in the Yao–Dolev security model. We propose an alternative scheme, which is able to solve these issues and can provide in addition a more efficient key agreement and subsequently a communication phase between two IoT devices connected to the same authentication server. The scheme also offers identity based authentication and repudiation, when only using elliptic curve multiplications and additions, instead of the compute intensive pairing operations.","","","","28971f54716b08a8f6674ee2b6789e74fd23ad5e","","","","","","PUF Based Authentication Protocol for IoT","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28971f54716b08a8f6674ee2b6789e74fd23ad5e","","2018"

Both signcryption schemes (providing digital signatures and encryption simultaneously) and digital signatures rely on computation-intensive public-key cryptography. When the number of signatures or encrypted messages the device needs to generate after deployment is limited, a trade-off can be made between performing the entire computation on the embedded device or moving part of the computation to a precomputation phase. The latter results in the storage of the precomputed values in the memory of the processor.

As a novel cutting-edge technology, the IoT enables a plethora of smart-devices equipped with diverse computing, sensing, and actuation capabilities to be connected to the Internet. Thus, it promises to provide a revolutionary and fully connected “smart” world while greatly developing economies and enhancing the quality of life. IoT is indeed an emergent global phenomenon, where real-time remote access to data and applications opens new unprecedented opportunities for ubiquitous monitoring and managing. In such dynamic, interconnected, and heterogeneous environment where the context conditions (location, time, situation sensitivity, etc.) are continuously and frequently changing, context-aware and adaptive solutions for data access are required to respond to the applications’ needs. Nevertheless, until now, no schemes provide concrete context-aware access control mechanisms in IoT. In this article, we design a novel context-aware attribute-based access control (CAABAC) that considers the dynamic context changes. The proposed approach incorporates the contextual information with the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to guarantee adaptive contextual access to data. The extensive analysis and simulations prove both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

In CMGs-CLPSS, an encrypted message can only be decrypted by a designated receiver who is also responsible for verifying the message; moreover, if a later dispute over repudiation occurs, the designated receiver can readily announce ordinary CLPS for public verification without any extra computation effort. CMGs-CLPSS is proved to have the indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2 security) and existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen-message attacks (UF-CMA security) in the random oracle model.

"650",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a lot of sensitive information in our daily lives are now digitalized and open to remote access. The provision of security and privacy of such data would incur comprehensive cryptographic services and has raised wide concern. Hybrid signcryption schemes could achieve various kinds of cryptographic services (e.g., confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity) with much lower cost than the combination of separate traditional cryptographic schemes with each providing a single cryptographic service. Thus, hybrid signcryption schemes are very suitable for IoT environments where resources are generally very constrained (e.g., lightweight sensors and mobile phones). To ensure that the overall hybrid signcryption scheme provides adequate cryptographic service (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, and authentication), its parts of KEM (key encryption mechanism) and DEM (data encryption mechanism) must satisfy some security requirements. Chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security has been widely accepted as the golden standard requirement for general encryption schemes. However, CCA security appears too strong in some conditions. Accordingly, Canetti et al. (CRYPTO 2003) proposed the notion of replayable CCA security (RCCA) for encryption schemes, which is a strictly weaker security notion than CCA security and naturally more efficient. This new security notion has proved to be sufficient for most existing applications of CCA security, e.g., encrypted password authentication. This is particularly promising for IoT environments, where security is demanding, yet resources are constrained. In this paper, we examine the RCCA security of the well-known SKEM+DEM style hybrid signcryption scheme by Dent at ISC 2005. Meanwhile, we also examine the RCCA security of the Tag-SKEM+DEM style hybrid signcryption scheme by Bjorstad and Dent at PKC 2006. We rigorously prove that a hybrid signcryption scheme can achieve RCCA security if both its SKEM part and its DEM part satisfy some security assumptions.","","","","140f0c407f4cf474ccea5a7002b3f19d7fb87a99","","","","","","On the RCCA Security of Hybrid Signcryption for Internet of Things","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/140f0c407f4cf474ccea5a7002b3f19d7fb87a99","","2018"

Using the three parameters of total T3/T4 ratio, TSH and T-ALP activity, all of which can be obtained within one hour in our hospital, 173 untreated patients with thyrotoxicosis were evaluated for the ratio of each parameter. For GD vs. PT, total T3/T4 (ng/microg) ratio (>20), TSH (<0.005 microU/ml) and elevated T-ALP had a likelihood ratio of 2.14, 2.12 and 4.07, respectively. When a patient had all three positive parameters, the likelihood ratio increased to 5.81, which showed effective synergy. These data suggest that, in addition to total T3/T4 ratio and TSH value, T-ALP activity is a useful parameter for the rapid differentiation of GD. The lower T-ALP activity seen in PT is probably due to the fact that patients develop less severe thyrotoxicosis or visit hospital earlier than patients with GD. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy for Graves' disease might be increased by using the three parameters in combination.","","","","0b7f8ded85d0976ca727554ce8116162fc343fc2","","","","","","Rapid differential diagnosis of Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis using total T3/T4 ratio, TSH, and total alkaline phosphatase activity.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b7f8ded85d0976ca727554ce8116162fc343fc2","","2005"

Due to the insufficient energy or deep fading, some of the relays in decoding set may fail to deliver the source signal to destination. By excluding these relays from the decoding set, we further construct a forwarding set, from which one best relay is then selected to forward the information-bearing signal, while all the unselected relays keep on harvesting energy for future use.

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 August 2002); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002); MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 1980 to week July 2003). Authors of trials were contacted for further data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: a randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trial, involving the use of a fluoride-containing product compared with no use or use of a non-fluoride control and enamel demineralisation was assessed during or after orthodontic treatment.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Six reviewers independently, in duplicate, extracted data. The primary outcome was the difference in the presence or absence of white spots between experimental and control patients for parallel design studies, and between experimental and control quadrants, for split-mouth design studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken for the items assessed for quality and publication bias.


MAIN RESULTS
The primary outcome of the review was the presence or absence of white spots by patient at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included any quantitative assessment of enamel mineral loss or lesion depth. Other outcomes such as differences in size and severity of white spots, any patient based outcomes, such as perception of white spots could not be included because there were insufficient data. Fifteen trials, with 723 participants, provided data for this review. None of the studies fulfilled all of the methodological quality assessment criteria. There is some evidence that a daily sodium fluoride mouthrinse reduces the severity of enamel decay surrounding a fixed brace (weighted mean difference for lesion depth -70.0; 95% CI -118.2 to -21.8) and that use of a glass ionomer cement for bracket bonding reduces the prevalence (Peto OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84) and severity of white spots (weighted mean difference for mineral loss -645 vol%.microm; 95% CI -915 to -375) compared with composite resins.


REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS
There is some evidence that the use of topical fluoride or fluoride-containing bonding materials during orthodontic treatment reduces the occurrence and severity of white spot lesions, however there is little evidence as to which method or combination of methods to deliver the fluoride is the most effective. Based on current best practice in other areas of dentistry, for which there is evidence, we recommend that patients with fixed braces rinse daily with a 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthrinse. More high quality, clinical research is required into the different modes of delivering fluoride to the orthodontic patient.","","","","0c7c6b0f446a6d69c794528fe3482a6b5449d64f","","","","","","Fluorides for the prevention of white spots on teeth during fixed brace treatment.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c7c6b0f446a6d69c794528fe3482a6b5449d64f","","2004"

The aim of the current research was to evaluate the efficacy of different fluoride-releasing bonding products in preventing enamel demineralization around orthodontic brackets by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This research was performed using 80 healthy human premolar teeth that were extracted in course of orthodontic therapy. Until use, the sample premolars were subjected to storage in 0.1% thymol. Each premolar was thereafter cleansed with pumice for 10 seconds. Stainless steel brackets for premolars were employed. The 80 samples were allocated at random to one of the four groups (20 in each) as follows: Group I, control; group II, Transbond Plus color change adhesive; group III, GC Fuji Ortho LC; and group IV, Vitremer. An hour following bonding, all samples were subjected to pH cycling at a temperature of 37°C for a 14-day period. The premolar teeth were assessed below SEM. Analysis was performed with the one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at a p-value less than 0.05.


RESULTS
The extreme area of demineralization was abridged by the use of Transbond™ Plus color change adhesive (108.19 ± 0.68), trailed by GC Fuji Ortho LC (119.24 ± 0.37) use, Vitremer (121.56 ± 0.92) as well as the control group (141.88 ± 1.09) in that order. And there was a statistically significant difference found between the groups (p <0.001). Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) was employed in an overall comparison of mean areas of enamel demineralization, which depicted that differences were significant statistically with the exception of group III and group IV.


CONCLUSION
The current research came to a conclusion that the Transbond Plus color change adhesive group was more potent in significant inhibition of demineralization areas in comparison to GC Fuji Ortho LC group and Vitremer group.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
In course of fixed orthodontic therapy, demineralization of enamel is an inherent occurrence. Multiple approaches are being continually developed to avoid the formation of white spot lesions (WSLs) that compromise esthetics and cause deprived remineralization that enhances the menace of dental caries. Bonding agents that can release fluorides are thus considered highly efficacious.","","","","e14dd7979e381202e071d6e68b706af90baca32b","","","","","","Assessment of the Effectiveness of Different Fluoride-releasing Bonding Agents on Prevention of Enamel Demineralization around Orthodontic Bracket: An In Vitro Study.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e14dd7979e381202e071d6e68b706af90baca32b","","2021"

This literature review aims to update the evidence for prevention of white spot lesion (WSL) using orthodontic sealants among patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.


BACKGROUND
As a major issue among orthodontists, prolonged treatment duration increases the risk of plaque development around orthodontic brackets and bands. In consequence, this can lead to heightened risk for caries development and higher possibility of WSL development around fixed orthodontic brackets.


RESULTS
Increased prevalence of WSLs generally occurs during orthodontic treatment. This review explored various products of orthodontic sealants used to prevent WSL. Orthodontic sealants do not require patient compliance and thus will further lessen the burden among orthodontists as well as support enamel surface for a long period of time during treatment. Certain factors, however, are considered important in the efficacy of these sealants, such as antibacterial activity, color stability, resistance to acid and brush abrasion, and their effect on shear bond strength (SBS).


CONCLUSION
The review showed that the use of orthodontic sealants in preventing WSLs during and after fixed orthodontic treatment is significantly effective. However, the bioactive glass is deemed more effective against WSL development due to its ability to immediately repair enamel surface, low cytotoxicity, and high biocompatibility. Moreover, clinical studies on bioactive glass are still needed to determine its acceptability among patients with fixed orthodontic appliance.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Development of WSL around the orthodontic brackets during treatment is a difficult task among orthodontists. As such, this review explored various strategies to effectively combat WSL development for good oral health and esthetics during orthodontic treatment.","","","","aa52b1ade8ed1b1a354674314a4deb650dcafef8","","","","","","Sealants and White Spot Lesions in Orthodontics: A Review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa52b1ade8ed1b1a354674314a4deb650dcafef8","","2020"

The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the antimicrobial properties of selenium-containing vs. fluoride-containing orthodontic materials. Material/Methods Antibacterial efficacy of orthodontic materials (SeLECT Defense bonding agent, Adhesive agent, Band Cement, Transbond Plus SEP bonding agent, Transbond Plus Adhesive agent, Fuji I Band cement, Fuji Ortho LC Adhesive agent, Ortho Solo Bonding agent, Transbond XT bonding agent, and Transbond XT primer) was tested with the inhibition of 2 bacterial strains: S. mutans (ATCC 10449) and L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356). The antimicrobial efficacy of the materials was measured by agar diffusion test. The diameters of inhibition zones around each disk were measured in millimeters (mm). Results Materials containing selenium and fluoride showed significant differences from the negative control (both p<0.001). Orthodontic materials containing fluoride as a potential antimicrobial agent showed larger zones of inhibition in total (9.1±2.6 mm), the selenium group was the second-most effective (4.7±4.9 mm), and the group without any potential antimicrobial agent showed the least antimicrobial effect (0.9±1.0 mm). Materials from the group with no antibacterial agent were not significantly different from the negative control group (p>0.05). Conclusions Materials containing selenium carried the most significance when comparing microorganisms with the agent, since they were the only ones showing difference between the 2 microorganisms. They showed statistically significant difference in efficacy against S. mutans, and poor antimicrobial effect against L. acidophilus. These data suggest that orthodontic materials containing selenium might have the potential to prevent WSLs due to their antimicrobial properties.","","","","bdfac336ed3cf604042bd6958960c1a6bd09a785","","","","","","Antimicrobial Effect of Orthodontic Materials on Cariogenic Bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdfac336ed3cf604042bd6958960c1a6bd09a785","","2020"
"680",":Paper","CC-BY","BACKGROUND
Early dental decay or demineralised lesions (DLs, also known as white spot lesions) can appear on teeth during fixed orthodontic (brace) treatment. Fluoride reduces decay in susceptible individuals, including orthodontic patients. This review compared various forms of topical fluoride to prevent the development of DLs during orthodontic treatment. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2013.


OBJECTIVES
The primary objective was to evaluate whether topical fluoride reduces the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs after fixed appliances. The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of topical fluoride delivery in reducing the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs, as well as the severity of lesions, in terms of number, size and colour. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DLs, and oral health-related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects.


SEARCH METHODS
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 1 February 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 1 February 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 1 February 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 1 February 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus a placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. Cochrane's statistical guidelines were followed.


MAIN RESULTS
This update includes 10 studies and contains data from nine studies, comparing eight interventions, involving 1798 randomised participants (1580 analysed). One report contained insufficient information and the authors have been contacted. We assessed two studies as at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk of bias, and two at high risk of bias. Two placebo (non-fluoride) controlled studies, at low risk of bias, investigated the professional application of varnish (7700 or 10,000 parts per million (ppm) fluoride (F)), every six weeks and found insufficient evidence of a difference regarding its effectiveness in preventing new DLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.93; 405 participants; low-certainty evidence). One placebo (non-fluoride) controlled study, at unclear risk of bias, provides a low level of certainty that fluoride foam (12,300 ppm F), professionally applied every two months, may reduce the incidence of new DLs (12% versus 49%) after fixed orthodontic treatment (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; 95 participants). One study, at unclear risk of bias, also provides a low level of certainty that use of a high-concentration fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) by patients may reduce the incidence of new DLs (18% versus 27%) compared with a conventional fluoride toothpaste (1450 ppm F) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00; 380 participants). There was no evidence for a difference in the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs on the teeth after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances for the following comparisons: - an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination versus a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse, - an amine fluoride gel versus a non-fluoride placebo applied by participants at home once a week and by professional application every three months, - resin-modified glass ionomer cement versus light-cured composite resin for bonding orthodontic brackets, - a 250 ppm F mouthrinse versus 0 ppm F placebo mouthrinse, - the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The last two comparisons involved studies that were assessed at high risk of bias, because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, although the internal validity and hence the quality of the studies has improved since the first version of the review, they have compared different interventions; therefore, the findings are only considered to provide low level of certainty, because none has been replicated by follow-up studies, in different settings, to confirm external validity. A patient-reported outcome, such as concern about the aesthetics of any DLs, was still not included as an outcome in any study. Reports of adverse effects from topical fluoride applications were rare and unlikely to be significant. One study involving fluoride-containing glass beads reported numerous breakages.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
This review found a low level of certainty that 12,300 ppm F foam applied by a professional every 6 to 8 weeks throughout fixed orthodontic treatment, might be effective in reducing the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs. In addition, there is a low level of certainty that the patient use of a high fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) throughout orthodontic treatment, might be more effective than a conventional fluoride toothpaste. These two comparisons were based on single studies. There was insufficient evidence of a difference regarding the professional application of fluoride varnish (7700 or 10,000 ppm F). Further adequately powered, randomised controlled trials are required to increase the certainty of these findings and to determine the best means of preventing DLs in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. The most accurate means of assessing adherence with the use of fluoride products by patients and any possible adverse effects also need to be considered. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DLs on patient satisfaction with treatment.","","","","7eff9fc8b2afedc5ca44543582610827996d1066","","","","","","Fluorides for preventing early tooth decay (demineralised lesions) during fixed brace treatment.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7eff9fc8b2afedc5ca44543582610827996d1066","","2019"

One of the conservative interventions for regression of these lesions is using chemical solutions. The current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of fluoride and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) on microhardness improvement of affected enamel. Material and Methods Forty-five intact human incisor teeth were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups of 15. Fluoride group, ACP group and artificial saliva group (control group). Inducing of white spot lesion was done by PH-cycling model. Samples of the first and second group were submerged into 0.05% fluoride and 0.05% ACP solutions respectively for one minute a day. The rest of the time, all specimens were put in artificial saliva, which was incubated in 37 °c temperature. Microhardness of specimens was assessed by Vickers microhardness test in three stages: 1: Baseline microhardness assessment that was done before induction of white spot lesion, 2: Secondary microhardness assessment that was done after induction, 3: Final microhardness assessment that was done after chemical treatment. The SPSS 11.5 software was used for statistical analysis and p< 0.05 was considered as significant. Results Microhardness of specimens in the fluoride and ACP groups had significantly improved after the treatment (between secondary assessment and final assessment). In the control group, no significant improvements were observed. In final assessment, there were significant differences between the ACP and control groups, but no significant differences were found neither between the fluoride and ACP, nor the Fluoride and control groups. Conclusions According to the current study, both 0.05% ACP and 0.05% fluoride solutions enhanced enamel micro-hardness in treatment of white spot lesion.

Methods In total, 125 bracket-bonded bovine incisor enamel blocks with artificial WSLs were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups (home bleaching, home bleaching + fluoridation, in-office bleaching, and in-office bleaching + fluoridation). A spectroradiometer (SR) and digital images (DIs) were used to evaluate colorimetric parameters (Commission Internationale l'Eclairage L*a*b*) for all specimens. Color measurements were obtained before WSL formation (T1), after WSL formation (T2), and after completion of the external tooth bleaching treatment (T3). Results The SR-based color change after bleaching was significantly greater in the treatment groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). SR-based lightness (L*) and red-green (a*) values were significantly higher at T2 than at T1 (p < 0.001), with no significant changes in yellow-blue (b*) values. At T3, SR-based L* values had increased while a* and b* values had decreased in the treatment groups (p < 0.001). The DI-based color difference between the sound enamel and WSL areas (ΔE*DI) increased significantly from T1 to T2 in all groups (p < 0.001) and significantly decreased from T2 to T3 in the treatment groups (p < 0.001). No significant differences in ΔE*DI at T3 were shown between the four treatment groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions The findings of this study suggested that external tooth bleaching with fluoridation can alleviate the conspicuity of WSLs.","","","","708c5c51393aaa4aca176aec8b1ff3640472d2f1","","","","","","Colorimetric evaluation of white spot lesions following external bleaching with fluoridation: An in-vitro study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/708c5c51393aaa4aca176aec8b1ff3640472d2f1","","2018"

To investigate the integrity of a fluorescing resin-based sealant placed around orthodontic brackets using the Fluorescence-aided Identification Technique (FIT).


MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Standard brackets were bonded to the buccal surfaces of 17 extracted sound permanent premolar crowns sealed with ProSeal®. Specimens were thermocycled (20,000 cycles, 5-55°C), and toothbrushing was simulated using an electric toothbrush and artificial aqueous toothpaste slurry. Changes in the sealed area were measured after one, two, three, and four alternating thermocycling-brushing cycles simulating 2 years of wear. Digital images were captured applying FIT (405 nm) using a digital camera-equipped stereomicroscope. ImageJ was used to measure sealant integrity and loss.


RESULTS:
There was a time-dependent decrease in sealed areas by between 21% and 100% (mean 54%). The sealant lost its integrity immediately after the first cycle, and unfilled areas were observed in all samples.


CONCLUSIONS:
The analyzed sealant lost its integrity over time. Using the proposed FIT, sealed surfaces were easily verified and quantified.","","","","554b46c96a8ef19c5a24484465ed107686a91afb","","","","","","Integrity testing of a smooth surface resin sealant around orthodontic brackets using a new Fluorescence-aided Identification Technique (FIT).","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/554b46c96a8ef19c5a24484465ed107686a91afb","","2018"

In this in vitro study, 50 human premolar teeth were randomly classified into five groups. At baseline, all the samples were assessed by using a colorimeter (E0). Then, white spot lesions were induced on the surface of the teeth by means of a pH-cycling model, and the colorimeter was used again (E1). Afterwards, samples of the 1st and 2nd groups were kept in 0.05% ACP and 0.5% ACP solutions for 1 min/day, respectively. The 3rd group specimens were placed in 0.05% fluoride solution for 1 min/day. The other two groups were kept in artificial saliva and distilled in water separately. All the samples were assessed by the colorimeter for a third time (E2).

The questionnaire included eight general questions and eight questions about practice with regard to the prevention and treatment of WSL. Data were analyzed by descriptive tests, ANOVA test, and t-test in SPSS 20 software. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean score of orthodontists’ practice was 7.62 (range: 0–8), and 94.4% of the participants were rated as good, while 3.7% and 1.9% were rated as moderate and weak, respectively. Women's score was significantly higher than that of men (P = 0.001). With increasing participants’ age, their practice has been improved (P = 0.001), but there was no significant relation between years of experience and their practice (P = 0.230). Nearly 94.4% of the orthodontists prescribed fluoride products. Toothpastes and fluoride mouth rinses were the most common prescribed products (34%). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to Iranian orthodontists’ practice, it was fortunate to note that majority of the respondents were taking care of their patients with regarding to the prevention and treatment of WSLs. For enhancing their competencies, it is recommended to plan educational courses which are useful for promoting their knowledge and practice about new products and procedures used for the prevention and treatment of WSLs.","","","","894c31fe7aab306afe9a075c177c0ea3074beb06","","","","","","Assessment of Iranian orthodontists’ practice with regard to the prevention and treatment of white spot lesions","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/894c31fe7aab306afe9a075c177c0ea3074beb06","","2017"

"687",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Decalcification of enamel, appearing as white spot lesions (WSLs), around fixed orthodontic appliances is a major challenge during and after fixed orthodontic treatment by considering the fact that the goal of orthodontic treatment is to enhance facial and dental esthetic appearance. Banded or bonded teeth exhibit a significantly higher rate of WSLs compared to the controls with no braces as fixed appliances and the bonding materials promote retention of biofilms. These lesions are managed in the first step by establishing good oral hygiene habits and prophylaxis with topical fluorides, including high-fluoride toothpastes, fluoride mouthwashes, gels, varnishes, fluoride-containing bonding materials, and elastic ligatures. Recently, other materials and methods have been recommended, including the application of casein phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphate, antiseptics, probiotics, polyols, sealants, laser, tooth bleaching agents, resin infiltration, and microabrasion.

To evaluate the correlation between clinical and salivary microbial parameters during treatment with removable orthodontic appliances with or without use of fluoride mouth rinse.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A group of 48 patients completed this randomized, controlled, parallel-group, clinical pilot study. 24 patients of the test group (TG) rinsed after tooth brushing with a fluoride mouth rinse (100 ppm AmF/150 ppm NaF) while 21 patients of the control group (CG) did not. Clinical parameters [Approximal Plaque Index (API), Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI)] as well as levels of salivary mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli (LB) were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Compliance was documented by participants. Appliance wear-times were estimated retrospectively by the patients. All participants received the same brushing instructions and were supplied with the same toothbrush/toothpaste.


RESULTS
A significant correlation of API values with MS levels (p=0.0003) or with LB levels (p=0.001) was observed. Furthermore, appliance wear-times were significantly associated with API values (p=0.02). The changes of MS or LB levels between beginning and end of the study did not differ significantly between study groups. The changes of the API scores showed slightly different median values (-3.5 in the TG vs. 0 in the CG), the difference, however, was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The results emphasise the need for a careful monitoring of the oral hygiene status in patients with removable orthodontic appliances. Larger controlled clinical trials are necessary to investigate treatment options such as use of supplementary fluoride mouth rinse.","","","","60cb4a59ddcdb616da5e56ca0a883adb32eb42c0","","","","","","Association between clinical and salivary microbial parameters during orthodontic treatment with removable appliances with or without use of fluoride mouth rinse.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60cb4a59ddcdb616da5e56ca0a883adb32eb42c0","","2016"

Material and Methods Information search for controlled studies on humans published between January 2008 and February 2016 was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, The Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were: the English language, study on humans, patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, randomized or quasi-randomized controlled clinical studies fluoride-containing product or casein derivates used throughout the appliance therapy or straightaway after debonding. Results 326 articles were reviewed (Embase 141, PubMed 129, ScienceDirect 41, Cochrane 15). Twelve clinical studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Use of fluoridated toothpaste had a remineralizing effect on white spot lesions (WSLs) (P < 0.05); fluoride varnish and casein supplements were effective in prevention and early treatment of WSLs (P < 0.05). Conclusions Early detection of white spot lesions during orthodontic treatment would allow implementing preventive measures to control the demineralization process before lesions progress. The systemic review has showed that the usage of fluoride and casein supplements in ameliorating white spot lesions during and after fixed orthodontic treatment is significantly effective. However the use of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate can be more beneficial than fluoride rinse in the reduction of demineralization spots.","","","","a39095379a5bd156cbd0b10a590e34a80971af96","","","","","","Prevention and Treatment of White Spot Lesions During and After Treatment with Fixed Orthodontic Appliances: a Systematic Literature Review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a39095379a5bd156cbd0b10a590e34a80971af96","","2016"

White spot lesions (WSLs) are a side effect of orthodontic treatment, causing esthetic problems and a risk of deeper enamel and dentine lesions. Many strategies have been developed for preventing WSLs, but great variability exists in preventive measures between orthodontists. This study developed statements on which a clinical practice guideline (CPG) can be developed in order to help orthodontists select preventive measures based on the best available evidence.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A nominal group technique (RAND-e modified Delphi procedure) was used. A multidisciplinary expert panel rated 264 practice- and evidence-based statements related to the management of WSLs. To provide panel members with the same knowledge, a total of six articles obtained from a systematic review of the literature were read by the panel in preparation of three consensus rounds. According to the technique, a threshold of 75% of all ratings within any 3-point section of the 9-point scale regarding a specific statement was accepted as consensus.


RESULTS
After the first and second consensus rounds, consensus was reached on 37.5 and 31.1% of statements, respectively. For the remaining 31.4% of statements, consensus was reached during a 4-h consensus meeting.


CONCLUSIONS
Statements on the management of WSLs derived from a systematic literature review combined with expert opinion were formally integrated toward consensus through a nominal group technique. These statements formed the basis for developing a CPG on the management of WSLs before and during orthodontic treatment.","","","","89b83cb34ac13a61d9f614f99ea179f32fc6d556","","","","","","Caries preventive measures in orthodontic practice: the development of a clinical practice guideline.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89b83cb34ac13a61d9f614f99ea179f32fc6d556","","2016"
"692",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","PURPOSE
The oral cavity is a rich ecosystem with a plethora of microorganisms, and different components of fixed orthodontic appliances may contribute to a shift in the balance of oral ecology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of hexane and ethanol extracts of Salvadora persica on a monospecies biofilm model established on orthodontic brackets in vitro.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Streptococcus mutans biofilm was formed on mini diamond orthodontic brackets following three days of anaerobic incubation at 37˚C. The bacterial cell viability of this biofilm was measured after their exposure to saline, hexane extract of S. persica, ethanol extract of S. persica and 0.2% chlorhexidine using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. On half of the brackets, the colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Both experiments were performed in triplicate.


RESULTS
The absorbance values obtained from the MTS reduction assay after exposure to the different test agents showed a decline in the bacterial cell viability of the S. mutans biofilm as follows: chlorhexidine (+)<hexane extract (S. persica, 5 mg/ml)<ethanol extract (S. persica, 5 mg/ml)<saline+2% DMSO (-). There was significant difference between saline+2% DMSO and the other test solutions (p<0.05). The mean absorbance values showed that the antimicrobial activity of hexane extract was slightly more effective than that of the ethanol extract and was nearly as effective as chlorhexidine (+). However, the differences in the absorbance values between the extracts of S. persica and chlorhexidine (+) were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The CFU counts of S. mutans obtained from chlorhexidine exposure were lower than from hexane and ethanol extracts.


CONCLUSION
S. persica extracts were found to have antimicrobial effects on S. mutans biofilm established in vitro on orthodontic brackets suggestive of its potential use as an oral antimicrobial agent for orthodontic patients.","","","","36211c17dcd7971d9df65776867ce67646b4eab7","","","","","","Antimicrobial Efficacy of Salvadora persica Extracts on a Monospecies Biofilm on Orthodontic Brackets In Vitro.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36211c17dcd7971d9df65776867ce67646b4eab7","","2016"

To analyse meta-analyses included in systematic reviews (SRs) published in leading orthodontic journals and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) focusing on orthodontic literature and to assess the quality of the existing evidence.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Electronic searching was undertaken to identify SRs published in five major orthodontic journals and the CDSR between January 2000 and June 2014. Quality assessment of the overall body of evidence from meta-analyses was conducted using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group (GRADE) tool.


RESULTS
One hundred and fifty-seven SRs were identified; meta-analysis was present in 43 of these (27.4 per cent). The highest proportion of SRs that included a meta-analysis was found in Orthodontics and Craniofacial Research (6/13; 46.1 per cent), followed by the CDSR (12/33; 36.4 per cent) and the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics (15/44; 34.1 per cent). Class II treatment was the most commonly addressed topic within SRs in orthodontics (n = 18/157; 11.5 per cent). The number of trials combined to produce a summary estimate was small for most meta-analyses with a median of 4 (range: 2-52). Only 21 per cent (n = 9) of included meta-analyses were considered to have a high/moderate quality of evidence according to GRADE, while the majority were of low or very low quality (n = 34; 79.0 per cent).


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, approximately one quarter of orthodontic SRs included quantitative synthesis, with a median of four trials per meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence from the selected orthodontic SRs was predominantly low to very low indicating the relative lack of high quality of evidence from SRs to inform clinical practice guidelines.","","","","e02a9adbc16caa15fd22d3e60f8c116d69aebcd1","","","","","","The evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in orthodontic literature.

"695",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","INTRODUCTION
There is a paucity of information with regard to the susceptibility of iatrogenic white spot lesion formation after inattentive, surplus orthodontic etching with 30% phosphoric acid and the subsequent provision or absence of adequate oral hygiene.


METHODS
Ninety sound enamel specimens were randomly allocated to 6 trial groups (N = 15 each) for etching with 30% phosphoric acid for either 15 seconds and standardized daily enamel brushing or no brushing, etching for 30 seconds with daily brushing or no brushing, or nonetched controls with brushing or no brushing. Nutritive acidic assaults were simulated by demineralization cycles 3 times per day for 1 hour with interim storage in artificial saliva. Lesion depths in terms of percentage of fluorescence loss (delta F, delta Q) and lesion extension compared with the baseline were assessed by using quantitative light-induced fluorescence after 2, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days. Etching duration, trial time elapse, and oral hygiene, as well as the significance of factor interactions, were analyzed with 3-way analysis of variance (α=5%).


RESULTS
The impact of the factors of enamel brushing, trial time elapse, and etching each had a comparably significant effect on lesion progression. The effect of surplus etching on white spot lesion formation was significantly enhanced by the simultaneous absence of enamel brushing and also the progression of trial time. The combination of 30 seconds of surplus etching with inadequate oral hygiene was especially detrimental.


CONCLUSIONS
Excessive surplus orthodontic etching of the complete labial enamel surface, instead of the bracket bases only, must be avoided to prevent iatrogenic white spot lesions. Etching times not exceeding 15 seconds are favorable.","","","","cf4229485d9abc0e732aef277561344126bf611e","","","","","","[Increased susceptibility for white spot lesions by surplus orthodontic etching exceeding bracket base area].","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf4229485d9abc0e732aef277561344126bf611e","","2015"
"696",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","BACKGROUND
Dental caries is a highly prevalent chronic disease which affects the majority of people. It has been postulated that the consumption of xylitol could help to prevent caries. The evidence on the effects of xylitol products is not clear and therefore it is important to summarise the available evidence to determine its effectiveness and safety.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effects of different xylitol-containing products for the prevention of dental caries in children and adults.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 14 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 14 August 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 14 August 2014), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 14 August 2014), Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 14 August 2014), Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 14 August 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of xylitol products on dental caries in children and adults.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where feasible. For continuous outcomes, we used means and standard deviations to obtain the mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the continuous data to calculate prevented fractions (PF) and 95% CIs to summarise the percentage reduction in caries. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. As there were less than four studies included in the meta-analysis, we used a fixed-effect model. We planned to use a random-effects model in the event that there were four or more studies in a meta-analysis.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 10 studies that analysed a total of 5903 participants. One study was assessed as being at low risk of bias, two were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining seven being at high risk of bias.The main finding of the review was that, over 2.5 to 3 years of use, a fluoride toothpaste containing 10% xylitol may reduce caries by 13% when compared to a fluoride-only toothpaste (PF -0.13, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.08, 4216 children analysed, low-quality evidence).The remaining evidence on children, from small single studies with risk of bias issues and great uncertainty associated with the effect estimates, was insufficient to determine a benefit from xylitol products. One study reported that xylitol syrup (8 g per day) reduced caries by 58% (95% CI 33% to 83%, 94 infants analysed, low quality evidence) when compared to a low-dose xylitol syrup (2.67 g per day) consumed for 1 year.The following results had 95% CIs that were compatible with both a reduction and an increase in caries associated with xylitol: xylitol lozenges versus no treatment in children (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol sucking tablets versus no treatment in infants (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol tablets versus control (sorbitol) tablets in infants (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol wipes versus control wipes in infants (low quality body of evidence).There was only one study investigating the effects of xylitol lozenges, when compared to control lozenges, in adults (low quality body of evidence). The effect estimate had a 95% CI that was compatible with both a reduction and an increase in caries associated with xylitol.Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects from any of the interventions. Two studies reported similar rates of adverse effects between study arms. The remaining studies either mentioned adverse effects but did not report any usable data, or did not mention them at all. Adverse effects include sores in the mouth, cramps, bloating, constipation, flatulence, and loose stool or diarrhoea.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
We found some low quality evidence to suggest that fluoride toothpaste containing xylitol may be more effective than fluoride-only toothpaste for preventing caries in the permanent teeth of children, and that there are no associated adverse-effects from such toothpastes. The effect estimate should be interpreted with caution due to high risk of bias and the fact that it results from two studies that were carried out by the same authors in the same population. The remaining evidence we found is of low to very low quality and is insufficient to determine whether any other xylitol-containing products can prevent caries in infants, older children, or adults.","","","","15aa44b6ecfeea25fe65e688d81920666c138abb","","","","","","Xylitol-containing products for preventing dental caries in children and adults.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15aa44b6ecfeea25fe65e688d81920666c138abb","","2015"

To clinically evaluate the prevalence of buccal caries and white spot lesions (WSLs) at debonding in governmental and private orthodontic patients, using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II) and the DIAGNOdent Pen, and to study the correlation between the two methods.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A cross-sectional study was carried out on the nonextracted premolars and anterior teeth of 89 orthodontic patients. They were recruited into two groups based on the treatment center they attended: governmental group (G; n=45) and private group (P; n=44). Immediately after debonding, the examination of buccal caries and WSLs on premolars and anterior teeth was carried out using the ICDAS-II and the DIAGNOdent Pen. Cross-tabulation was applied to study the correlation between the ICDAS-II index and the DIAGNOdent Pen by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient.


RESULTS
The G group showed a significantly higher (P<.0001) prevalence of WSLs and/or buccal caries compared to that of the P group based on evaluation by the two methods. Based on ICDAS-II, 43% of the patients in the P group and 9% in the G group were free from any WSLs. In the G group, 22% of the patients had ≥16 LESIONS, whereas there were none for the P group. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the two methods was .71.


CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of caries and/or WSLs at debonding was significantly higher in the G group compared to the P group.

To compare the esthetic improvements of white-spot lesions (WSLs) treated by fluoride, casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), or resin infiltration.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
WSLs were created on human enamel and randomly assigned to four groups: NaF (500 ppm), CPP-ACP, resin infiltration (Icon), or distilled deionized water (DDW; control group). The color change (ΔE) of each specimen was measured with a Crystaleye spectrophotometer, and fluorescence loss (ΔQ) was measured by quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF), at different time points after treatment: baseline (0 weeks), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks.


RESULTS
The ΔE and ΔQ baseline values for the four groups before the treatments did not differ significantly. Icon treatment improved the WSL color significantly and gave the lowest ΔE (2.9 ± 1.2 on average) compared with other treatments (P < .01). The Icon treatment also resulted in a significant change in the ΔQ of WSLs compared with baseline (P < .01). In the NaF and CPP-ACP treatment groups, ΔQ showed significant recovery compared with the baseline values only after 4 weeks after treatment (P < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
Resin infiltration is more effective than NaF or CPP-ACP in providing esthetic improvement of WSLs.","","","","028a0e39fe57e1b740c5e62a9a8b88c6863ad687","","","","","","Esthetic comparison of white-spot lesion treatment modalities using spectrometry and fluorescence.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/028a0e39fe57e1b740c5e62a9a8b88c6863ad687","","2014"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the statistical methods, the methodology, and the quality characteristics of orthodontic MAs and to assess their reporting quality during the last years. Electronic databases were searched for MAs (with or without a proper systematic review) in the field of orthodontics, indexed up to 2011. The AMSTAR tool was used for quality assessment of the included articles. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, and generalized linear modelling. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to represent changes during the years in reporting of key items associated with quality. A total of 80 MAs with 1086 primary studies were included in this evaluation. Using the AMSTAR tool, 25 (27.3%) of the MAs were found to be of low quality, 37 (46.3%) of medium quality, and 18 (22.5%) of high quality. Specific characteristics like explicit protocol definition, extensive searches, and quality assessment of included trials were associated with a higher AMSTAR score. Model selection and dealing with heterogeneity or publication bias were often problematic in the identified reviews. The number of published orthodontic MAs is constantly increasing, while their overall quality is considered to range from low to medium. Although the number of MAs of medium and high level seems lately to rise, several other aspects need improvement to increase their overall quality.","","","","be850f1c92a81a0b272f96a5433c5df978d660e5","","","","","","Reporting characteristics of meta-analyses in orthodontics: methodological assessment and statistical recommendations.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be850f1c92a81a0b272f96a5433c5df978d660e5","","2014"

"704",":Paper","CC-BY","BACKGROUND
Demineralised white lesions (DWLs) can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brackets that attach the braces to the teeth. Fluoride is effective in reducing decay in susceptible individuals in the general population. Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment. This review compares the effects of various forms of fluoride used during orthodontic treatment on the development of DWLs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.


OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of DWLs on the teeth during orthodontic treatment.The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of fluoride delivery in reducing the incidence of DWLs, as well as the size of lesions. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DWLs, and oral health-related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects.

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 31 January 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 31 January 2013); and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 31 January 2013).


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included trials if they met the following criteria: (1) parallel-group randomised clinical trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which (2) the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed.


MAIN RESULTS
For the 2013 update of this review, three changes were made to the protocol regarding inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies included in the previous version of the review were excluded from this update for the following reasons: five previously included studies were quasi-randomised, a further five were split-mouth studies, three measured outcomes on extracted teeth only and in one, the same fluoride intervention was used in each intervention group of the study.Three studies and 458 participants were included in this updated review. One study was assessed at low risk of bias for all domains, in one study the risk of bias was unclear and in the remaining study, the risk of bias was high.One placebo-controlled study of fluoride varnish applied every six weeks (253 participants, low risk of bias), provided moderate-quality evidence of an almost 70% reduction in DWLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44, P value < 0.001). This finding is considered to provide moderate-quality evidence for this intervention because it has not yet been replicated by further studies in orthodontic participants.One study compared two different formulations of fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse prescribed for participants undergoing orthodontic treatment (97 participants, unclear risk of bias) and found no difference between an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination and a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination for the outcomes of white spot index, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index.One small study (37 participants) compared the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The study was assessed at high risk of bias because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up, and compliance with use of the mouthrinse was not measured.Neither secondary outcomes of this review nor adverse effects of interventions were reported in any of the included studies.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
This review found some moderate evidence that fluoride varnish applied every six weeks at the time of orthodontic review during treatment is effective, but this finding is based on a single study. Further adequately powered, double-blind, randomised controlled trials are required to determine the best means of preventing DWLs in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment and the most accurate means of assessing compliance with treatment and possible adverse effects. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DWLs on participant satisfaction with treatment.","","","","245eef0958cb5cbebd7ce53691fa0544521cd9b2","","","","","","Fluorides for the prevention of early tooth decay (demineralised white lesions) during fixed brace treatment.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/245eef0958cb5cbebd7ce53691fa0544521cd9b2","","2013"
"705",":Paper","CC-BY","Objective: This study compares the effects of three different mouth rinses with respect to reducing Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) colony counts on the teeth and tongue surfaces. Materials and Methods: In this study, comparison tests using the alcohol-free 0.1% chlorhexidine mouth rinse, alcohol-containing essential oil mouth rinse, and alcohol-free essential oil-containing mouth rinse were conducted. Patients were instructed to avoid mechanical cleaning with either a toothbrush or toothpick for 4 days. The first samples were collected from teeth surfaces and the dorsum of the tongue after a professional cleaning, and the second samples were collected after a 4-day plaque re-growth period. The supragingival plaque from the buccal surfaces of teeth #11, 14, 31, 34 as well as samples from the dorsum of the tongue, were assessed using the Dentocult® strips. Results: The Listerine® and Ondrohexidine® groups did not show any statistically significant differences between the values of the two samples (P = 0.734, P = 0.307). The MC® group and the control group showed significantly higher results than the first sample values. The effectiveness of the mouth rinses on S. mutans colony counts from the teeth surfaces were higher in the Listerine® , Ondrohexidine® , and Mouthwash Concentrate® groups. The difference between the first and second samples of the S. mutans colony counts from the tongue surface was found to be statistically significant, and S. mutans colony counts were higher than the first sample (P = 0.015). Conclusion: Alcohol and essential oil-containing Listerine® mouth rinse, alcohol-free Ondrohexidine® , alcohol-free essential oil-containing MC® mouth rinse had the same effect on S. mutans counts, higher than the 1% alcohol solution on teeth surface. They had the ability to maintain the S. mutans counts at the same level for 4 days in patients who did not perform any mechanical oral hygiene regimen.","","","","ef8bc452429b5b2e4a06cdd66e8fb60a305610c6","","","","","","The effects of three different mouth rinses in a 4-day supragingival plaque regrowth study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef8bc452429b5b2e4a06cdd66e8fb60a305610c6","","2013"

White spot lesions (WSL) associated with fixed orthodontic appliances are a common adverse effect of orthodontic treatment and represent a significant challenge to achieving esthetic excellence. The purpose of this article is to review the current evidence regarding diagnosis, risk assessment, prevention, intratreatment management, and postorthodontic treatment of WSL, and to provide clinical recommendations useful for both the orthodontist and the general dentist. Caries risk assessment should be incorporated into initial evaluations of orthodontic patients, and risk-specific prevention and management protocols can help to eliminate or minimize this clinical problem. There are multiple options for treatment of WSL, ranging from conservative to invasive techniques; the severity of lesions is a determinant of which option is most appropriate.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
White spot lesions associated with orthodontic treatment are a common problem that can be minimized with appropriate prevention, management, and treatment approaches.","","","","2588976bce92101e74da40a30e385dec6497f53c","","","","","","A contemporary review of white spot lesions in orthodontics.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2588976bce92101e74da40a30e385dec6497f53c","","2013"
"709",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","OBJECTIVE
To investigate the influence of caries infiltrant preconditioning on the shear bond strength of orthodontic resin cements on sound and demineralized enamel.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
 Stainless-steel brackets were bonded to sound or artificially demineralized (14 d, acidic buffer, pH 5.0) bovine enamel specimens using a resin cement or a combination of caries infiltrant preconditioning (Icon, DMG) and the respective resin cement (light-curing composite: Heliosit Orthodontic, Transbond XT, using either Transbond XT Primer or Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer; light-curing resin-modified glass ionomer cement: Fuji Ortho; or self-curing composite: Concise Orthodontic Bonding System). Each group consisted of 15 specimens. Shear bond strength was evaluated after thermo-cycling (10,000×, 5°C to 55°C) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, and data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney test, and Weibull statistics. Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scores and enamel fractures were determined at 25× magnification and were statistically analyzed by regression analyses (P < .05).


RESULTS
The caries infiltrant system significantly increased the shear bond strength of Transbond XT Primer, Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer, and Fuji Ortho in sound specimens, and of all resin cements except for the Concise Orthodontic Bonding System in demineralized enamel. Overall, caries infiltrant preconditioning decreased significantly the number of enamel fractures, but it did not affect ARI scores.


CONCLUSION
Preconditioning of sound and demineralized enamel with the caries infiltrant system did not impair but rather increased the shear bond strength of most orthodontic resin cements while decreasing the risk of enamel fracture at debonding.","","","","11f9043cf45150a441a4c9b1967d9bc3b13d47f0","","","","","","Shear bond strength of orthodontic resins after caries infiltrant preconditioning.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11f9043cf45150a441a4c9b1967d9bc3b13d47f0","","2013"
"710",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Abstract Objective. To investigate the effect of daily intake of fluoridated milk on enamel demineralization adjacent to fixed orthodontic brackets assessed with quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF). Materials and methods. Sixty-four healthy adolescents (13–18 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances were enrolled and randomly allocated to a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. The intervention group was instructed to drink one glass of milk (∼ 200 ml) supplemented with fluoride (5 ppm) once daily and the subjects of the control group to drink the same amount of milk without fluoride. The intervention period was 12 weeks and the end-point was mineral gain or loss in enamel, assessed by QLF on two selected sites from each individual. The attrition rate was 12.5% and 112 sites were included in the final evaluation. Results. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups concerning fluorescence (ΔF) values and lesion area (A mm2) at baseline. After 12 weeks, a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in ΔF was registered in the fluoridated milk group and a significant increase in the non-fluoride control group (p < 0.05). The mean reduction in the test group was somewhat lower (14%) than the increase in the control group (18%), but individual variations were evident. Only minor alterations of lesion area were recorded over the 12-week period and no statistically significant differences compared with baseline were found in any of the groups. Conclusion. Daily intake of fluoridated milk may aid remineralization of white spot lesions adjacent to fixed orthodontic appliances.","","","","be9c9327d88cfde672d8c868c85770cbcb210dff","","","","","","Effect of fluoridated milk on enamel demineralization adjacent to fixed orthodontic appliances","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be9c9327d88cfde672d8c868c85770cbcb210dff","","2013"
"711",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background: Several studies have shown that laser-etching of enamel for bonding orthodontic brackets could be an appropriate alternative for acid conditioning, since a potential advantage of laser could or might be caries prevention. This study compared enamel resistance to demineralization following etching with acid phosphoric or Er:YAG laser for bonding orthodontic brackets. Materials and Methods: Fifty sound human premolars were divided into two equal groups. In the first group, enamel was etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds. In the second group, Er:YAG laser (wavelength, 2 940 nm; 300 mJ/pulse, 10 pulses per second, 10 seconds) was used for tooth conditioning. The teeth were subjected to 4-day PH-cycling process to induce caries-like lesions. The teeth were then sectioned and the surface area of the lesion was calculated in each microphotographs and expressed in pixel. The total surface of each specimen was 196 608 pixels. Results: Mean lesion areas were 7 171 and 7532 pixels for Laser-etched and Acid-etched groups, respectively. The two sample t-test showed that there was no significant difference in lesion area between the two groups (P = 0.914). Conclusion: Although Er:YAG laser seems promising for etching enamel before bonding orthodontic brackets, it does not reduce enamel demineralization when exposed to acid challenge.","","","","3bdb702bb288fed9ad3d9514f22e0c6ae87a8d72","","","","","","Enamel resistance to demineralization following Er:YAG laser etching for bonding orthodontic brackets","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bdb702bb288fed9ad3d9514f22e0c6ae87a8d72","","2012"

"715",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","OBJECTIVE
To evaluate in vitro the influence of topical fluoride application on the mechanical properties of orthodontic cements containing fluoride under pH cycling conditions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Edgewise brackets for maxillary central incisors were bonded to 192 bovine incisors using Transbond XT (G1), Transbond Plus Color Change (G2), and Fuji Ortho LC (G3) (n  =  64 for each group). The specimens of each group were subdivided (n  =  16) into different subgroups. Subgroup A received no topical fluoride application during pH cycling, while the experimental subgroups received topical fluoride treatments as follows: B, application three times per day of fluoride dentifrice (1450 ppm F); C, application one time per day of fluoride mouth rinse (250 ppm F); and D, combination of fluoride dentifrice and fluoride mouth rinse. After 14 days of pH cycling, the shear bond strength and Adhesive Remnant Index were evaluated statistically.


RESULTS
Polarized light microscopy showed that pH cycling induced mineral loss in all specimens. The topical application of fluoride did not have an influence on shear bond strength, although the association of fluoride dentifrice and mouth rinse increased the shear bond strength of the resinous cement without fluoride (P < .01). Regarding the Adhesive Remnant Index, no statistical differences were found within the groups G1 (P  =  .23), G2 (P  =  .47), and G3 (P  =  .74).


CONCLUSION
Topical fluoride treatments improved the shear bond strength of resinous cement, regardless of the material's fluoride-releasing capacity, and reached the adhesive fractures.","","","","76ae27569e4680089d99b840e565df134f11ca7f","","","","","","Influence of topical fluoride application on mechanical properties of orthodontic bonding materials under pH cycling.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76ae27569e4680089d99b840e565df134f11ca7f","","2012"

Long-lasting antibacterial properties of orthodontic cements can reduce this phenomenon. The aim of this research was to compare antimicrobial activity of three commercial glass ionomer cements with three commercial zinc phosphate cements, over time, against streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. Direct contact test (DCT) was used to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal activity of products after 48 h and 7 days of incubation. The results demonstrated that all the cements presented antibacterial activity but the antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements was more than that of zinc phosphate cements. Counts of C. albicans after 48 h were lower and statistically different in the GIC group in relation to the control groups. But no differences were observed between GIC and control groups at 7 days. Based on the results of this study, the antimicrobial and mainly antifungal effects of all the cements were so short.","","","","5cbfa38b65226ef079a4858b9c80a323b8176a15","","","","","","In-vitro Comparison of the Antimicrobial Properties of Glass Ionomer Cements with Zinc Phosphate Cements","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cbfa38b65226ef079a4858b9c80a323b8176a15","","2012"

"718",":Paper","CC-BY","The objective of this study was to appraise the clinical evidence and its bias risk regarding the anticariogenic effect of xylitol in comparison with that of fluoride. Databases were searched for clinical trials up to 18 March 2011. Article inclusion criteria were as follows: caries-related primary outcomes were tested; xylitol was compared with topical fluoride in some form; two-arm (or more) clinical trial including test/control group(s); prospective study design. Article exclusion criteria were as follows: no computable data were reported; test and control groups were not followed up in the same way; chewing gum was the main form of clinical application in either group. Individual continuous datasets were extracted from accepted articles. Selection and performance/detection bias were assessed. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate attrition bias risk. Egger's regression and funnel plot was used to investigate publication bias risk. Twelve articles were included. Of these, six were accepted and six excluded, and 21 continuous datasets were extracted. Owing to the high clinical heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was performed. The addition of xylitol to existing fluoride regimes may be beneficial in the prevention of caries. However, all identified trials were limited by potential risk of selection, performance/detection and attrition bias. The funnel plot and Egger's regression results (-2.80; 95% confidence interval -4.01, -1.58; P = 0.0001) indicated possible publication bias risk. External fluoride access may have confounded the measured anticariogenic effect of xylitol. The evidence found contains a high risk of bias and may be limited by confounder effects. Future high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed in order to provide conclusive evidence on this topic.","","","","35a2c68bf360528f1f894f1e75a1b7498c783d4d","","","","","","Anticariogenic effect of xylitol versus fluoride - a quantitative systematic review of clinical trials.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35a2c68bf360528f1f894f1e75a1b7498c783d4d","","2012"

The mean prevented fraction based on 6 trials was 42.5% with a range from -4% to 73%. The recent papers provided the strongest support for regular professional applications of fluoride varnish around the bracket base during the course of orthodontic treatment. For the treatment of post-orthodontic WSL, home-care applications of a remineralizing cream, based on casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate, as adjunct to fluoride toothpaste could be beneficial but the findings were equivocal. For emerging technologies such as sugar alcohols and probiotics, still only studies with surrogate endpoints are available. Thus, further well-designed studies with standardized regimes and endpoints are needed before guidelines on the non-fluoride technologies can be recommended.","","","","9ca6d7029cf304e915992045503f59e3a30cc29a","","","","","","A Review on Prevention and Treatment of Post-Orthodontic White Spot Lesions – Evidence-Based Methods and Emerging Technologies","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ca6d7029cf304e915992045503f59e3a30cc29a","","2011"

"726",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","This paper aims to assess systematic reviews on the caries-preventive effect of topical fluorides, identifying key content and reporting quality issues to be considered by researchers planning a review in this area. Published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of any topical fluoride intervention for caries control were included. Relevant databases were searched (December 2009), along with reference lists of included publications. Thirty-eight reports were identified and assessed. A majority of these focused on the child/adolescent population, fluoride toothpastes, no treatment/placebo comparisons, and had caries increment as the main outcome. Complete reporting of eligibility criteria (PICOS) was uncommon, except in Cochrane reviews. Less than half reported searching multiple sources and only one third reported a search strategy. Duplicate study selection and data extraction was reported in 27 (71%) and 16 (42%) reviews, respectively; quality assessment of included studies was not reported in one third of the reviews. Meta-analysis was reported in 20 (52%) reviews, with six not reporting the methods of synthesis used, 17 formally assessing heterogeneity, and 12 reporting analyses for its exploration. This study shows that some content features have been covered more often than others in existing fluoride reviews, while some relevant features are yet to be addressed. Also, reporting of several methodological aspects are below an acceptable level, except for Cochrane reviews. Current reporting guidelines for systematic reviews of interventions (e.g. PRISMA) and sources of high-quality existing reviews (e.g. The Cochrane Library) should be closely followed to enhance the validity and relevance of future topical fluoride reviews.","","","","e9ea461d69409106125383fc99532ca26ddf0b1f","","","","","","Systematic Reviews of Topical Fluorides for Dental Caries: A Review of Reporting Practice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9ea461d69409106125383fc99532ca26ddf0b1f","","2010"

"730",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Introduction: Aim of this systematic review was to assess the orthodontic related issues which currently provide the best evidence as documented by meta-analyses, by critically evaluating and discussing the methodology used in these studies. Material and Methods: Several electronic databases were searched and handsearching was also performed in order to identify the corresponding meta-analyses investigating orthodontic related subjects. In total, 197 studies were retrieved initially. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 27 articles were identified as meta-analyses treating orthodontic-related subjects. Results: Many of these 27 papers presented sufficient quality and followed appropriate meta-analytic approaches to quantitatively synthesize data and presented adequately supported evidence. However, the methodology used in some of them presented weaknesses, limitations or deficiencies. Consequently, the topics in orthodontics which currently provide the best evidence, include some issues related to Class II or Class III treatment, treatment of transverse problems, external apical root resorption, dental anomalies, such as congenital missing teeth and tooth transposition, frequency of severe occlusal problems, nickel hypersensitivity, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and computer-assisted learning in orthodontic education. Conclusions: Only a few orthodontic related issues have been so far investigated by means of MAs. In addition, for some of these issues investigated in the corresponding MAs no definite conclusions could be drawn, due to significant methodological deficiencies of these studies. According to this investigation, it can be concluded that at the begin of the 21st century there is evidence for only a few orthodontic related issues as documented by meta-analyses, and more well-conducted high quality research studies are needed to produce strong evidence in order to support evidence-based clinical practice in orthodontics.","","","","69dac543e6136cff0303517636eb1b9ffed0e13b","","","","","","Meta-Analyses and Orthodontic Evidence-Based Clinical Practice in the 21st Century","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69dac543e6136cff0303517636eb1b9ffed0e13b","","2010"

To evaluate oral fluoride (F) retention after using fluoridated toothpastes, rinsing solutions and chewing sticks (Miswaks) in orthodontic patients with and without orthodontic appliances. Material and methods. Nine orthodontic patients, with a mean age of 16 years, were included in a randomized, cross-over, experimental study. Six different home-care F products, two NaF toothpastes (0.32% and 1.1%), two NaF mouthwash solutions (0.05% and 0.2%) and two NaF-impregnated Miswaks chewing sticks (0.05% and 0.5%), were used both during the orthodontic treatment and 1 week after debonding. Unstimulated whole saliva and approximal saliva were collected from two interdental sites, before and up to 60 min after using each product for 2 min. The retention of F was calculated as the area under the 60-min F-clearance curve (AUC). Results. In general, the F concentrations at the various sites were higher before than after debonding. Moreover, the products with a high F content (toothpaste, mouthwash and Miswaks) resulted in higher F retention than the corresponding products with a lower F content. In whole saliva, the highest AUC values were found in patients using 0.2% NaF mouthwash, followed by 1.1% NaF toothpaste (p < 0.05). In approximal saliva, the retention values were highest after using 0.5% NaF-impregnated Miswaks in patients wearing orthodontic appliances (p < 0.001). Conclusions. The insertion of fixed orthodontic appliances appears to favor oral F retention for all the tested home-care F products. In addition, products with a high F content increase oral F retention.","","","","c6a7acd3d7e17a178073132be976933e6f1c1be7","","","","","","Oral fluoride retention in orthodontic patients with and without fixed appliances after using different fluoridated home-care products","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6a7acd3d7e17a178073132be976933e6f1c1be7","","2010"
"732",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Several fluoride-releasing bonding materials are available for orthodontic bracket placement. These are supposed to prevent white spot lesions during therapy. The objectives of this in vitro study were to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) and failure mode of a recently introduced fluoride-releasing adhesive, as well as the comparison with established orthodontic adhesives. Sixty bovine mandibular incisors were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 20): stainless steel brackets were bonded with Transbond Plus Color Change Adhesive, Transbond XT, or Light Bond. A universal testing machine was used to determine the SBS at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. After debonding, the adhesive remnant index (ARI) was used to assess the adhesive remaining on the brackets. One-way analysis of variance comparing the three experimental groups showed no differences between the bonding systems for mean SBS (P = 0.27). ARI scores showed more residual adhesive on the teeth bonded with the Transbond systems (P < 0.01). As the fluoride-releasing bonding system provided sufficient mean bond strength in vitro (19.9 MPa), it may be used as an additional prophylactic measure in orthodontic therapy. However, the clinical effectiveness of its fluoride release may be questionable, as the amount of fluoride required from a bonding material to be caries preventive is still unknown.","","","","b3e2d638e74caa33b75a29405e5c5a8886801ea0","","","","","","Shear bond strength of fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding and composite materials.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3e2d638e74caa33b75a29405e5c5a8886801ea0","","2010"

After 14 days of pH cycling, the caries preventive effect on the development of white spot lesion was evaluated considering the presence of inhibition zones to white spot lesions using two scores: 0= absence and 1= presence. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (a=0.05) were used. Formation of white spot lesions was observed only under pH cycling using acid saliva with pH 4.5; with Transbond Plus Color Change being significantly more effective (p<0.05) in preventing the appearance of white spot lesions effect than Orthodontic Fill Magic. The acidity of the demineralizing solution influenced the formation of white spot lesions around orthodontic brackets under highly cariogenic conditions.

"737",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","INTRODUCTION
Sagittal mandible deficiency is the most common cause of skeletal Class II malocclusion. Treatment objective is to stimulate sagittal mandible growth. Fixed functional Herbst appliance use is beneficial for shortening the time required for treatment and does not depend on patient compliance.


CASE OUTLINE
A 13-year-old girl was referred to the Clinic of Orthodontics, School of Dentistry in Belgrade following previous unsuccessful treatment of her skeletal Class II malocclusion using an activator. The patient's poor cooperation had led to failure of the treatment. Patient was subjected to the Herbst treatment for 6 months followed by fixed appliance for another 8 months. Lateral cephalograms before and after the treatment was performed. The remodelation of condylar and fossal articulation was assessed by superimposition of pre- and post-treatment temporomandibular joint tomograms. The promotion of oral hygiene and fluoride use was performed because orthodontic treatment carries a high caries risk and risk for periodontal disease. Skeletal and dental changes were observed after treatment (correction [Max+Mand]: molar relation 7 mm, overjet 8 mm, skeletal relation 5 mm, molars 2 mm, incisors 3 mm). Combination of Herbst and fixed appliances was effective in the treatment of dental and skeletal irregularities for a short period of time.


CONCLUSION
In the retention period, 14 months after treatment, occlusal stability exists. Follow-up care in oral prevention is based on regular recalls at the dental office and supervision at home by the parents.","","","","2d71bb443895a2d5eaee5408678b835359b8ecb5","","","","","","Clinical effects of fixed functional herbst appliance in the treatment of Class II/1 malocclusion.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d71bb443895a2d5eaee5408678b835359b8ecb5","","2009"

"740",":Paper","CC-BY","Dental caries on (proximal) tooth surfaces is still a problem in many industrialized countries. The objectives of this review were to present the scientific basis and the principles of the resin infiltration concept, to discuss the inherent clinical applications, and to describe how these backgrounds can be integrated into the concept of minimal intervention dentistry. Data were identified by searches of the Cochrane Registers, Medline, and Scopus. Articles published in English and German through December 2008 were selected, and most up-to-date or relevant references were chosen. Cross-referencing of significant articles identified additionally relevant articles written in other languages and those of historical value. A total of 23 in vitro studies (focusing on penetration depths or demineralization prevention) were found, and 3 clinical studies (involving 122 subjects) could be retrieved; these studies were not comparable. With an increased understanding of the caries process, it is now recognized that demineralized but noncavitated enamel lesions can be arrested or remineralized in many situations. The clinical research evidence on the resin infiltration technique currently is of moderate extent to reach any decisive conclusions; however, based on available laboratory and clinical studies, it seems convincing that resin infiltration of enamel lesions should reduce (or even stop) the progress of white spot lesions. Combining this ultraconservative restorative approach (which is considered microinvasive) with a substantial caries remineralization program may provide therapeutic benefits and significantly reduce both long-term restorative needs and costs, thus complementing the concept of minimal intervention dentistry.","","","","dd021c981f35f260d9aeee38192ece5524903511","","","","","","Closing the gap between oral hygiene and minimally invasive dentistry: a review on the resin infiltration technique of incipient (proximal) enamel lesions.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd021c981f35f260d9aeee38192ece5524903511","","2009"

A double-blind, randomized crossover study was performed and 24 healthy adolescents (12-16 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment were followed over four periods. During periods 2 and 4 (2 weeks each), the subjects ingested 200 g fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 (2 x 10(8) colony forming units/g) once daily or a control yogurt without viable bacteria. Periods 1 and 3 were run-in and wash-out periods of 1 and 6 weeks, respectively. Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits before and after the yogurt consumption periods. Pre- and post-treatment values within each regimen were compared with a two-tailed marginal homogeneity test for categorical data. A statistically significant reduction of salivary mutans streptococci was recorded after probiotic yogurt consumption (P < 0.05), which was in contrast to the control yogurt. No significant alterations of the salivary lactobacilli counts were observed. Short-term daily consumption of fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 may reduce the levels of mutans streptococci in saliva during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.","","","","31f79b312e7a6b82d76ea6dd3a3d57077bfab75c","","","","","","Reduction of salivary mutans streptococci in orthodontic patients during daily consumption of yoghurt containing probiotic bacteria.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31f79b312e7a6b82d76ea6dd3a3d57077bfab75c","","2009"
"742",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","OBJECTIVE
To test the null hypotheses: (1) there is no difference in the caries protective effect of ozone and Cervitec/Fluor Protector during multibracket (MB) appliance therapy, and (2) DIAGNOdent and quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) are not superior to a visual evaluation of initial caries lesions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty right-handed patients with a very poor oral hygiene who required full MB appliance therapy were analyzed during 26 months. In a split-mouth-design, the four quadrants of each patient were either treated with ozone, a combination of Cervitec and Fluor Protector, or served as untreated controls. The visible plaque index (VPI) and white spot formation were analyzed clinically. DIAGNOdent and QLF were used for a quantitative assessment of white spot formation.


RESULTS
The average VPI in all four dental arch quadrants amounted to 55.6% and was independent of the preventive measure undertaken. In the quadrants treated with Cervitec/Fluor Protector, only 0.7% of the areas developed new, clinically visible white spots. This was significantly (P < .05) less than in the quadrants treated with ozone (3.2%). The lesions detected with QLF only partially corresponded to the clinically detected white spots, while DIAGNOdent proved to be unable to detect any changes at all.


CONCLUSIONS
The caries protective effect of Cervitec/Fluor Protector during MB therapy was superior to ozone, and a visual evaluation of initial caries lesions was superior to both DIAGNOdent and QLF.","","","","118f1f4e71ba8726c5247fac1ae381e46c811d5f","","","","","","Preventive effect of ozone on the development of white spot lesions during multibracket appliance therapy.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/118f1f4e71ba8726c5247fac1ae381e46c811d5f","","2009"

"747",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Preventive treatment options can be divided into primary, secondary and tertiary prevention techniques, which can involve patient- or professionally applied methods. These include: oral hygiene (instruction), pit and fissure sealants ('temporary' or 'permanent'), fluoride applications (patient- or professionally applied), dietary assessment and advice (modification), other measures to help remineralize demineralized tissue and other measures to help modify the biofilm to reduce the cariogenic challenge. There is a considerable body of strong evidence supporting the use of specific techniques for primary prevention of caries in children, e.g. pit and fissure sealants and topically applied fluorides (including patient-applied fluoride toothpastes and professionally applied fluoride varnishes), but limited strong evidence for these techniques for secondary prevention--i.e. where early to established lesions with ICDAS codes 1-4 (and also the severer lesions coded 5 or 6) are involved--and in relation to adults. This lack of evidence reflects a shortage of high-quality trials in the area, as opposed to a series of good studies showing no effect. Since there is also limited longitudinal evidence supporting conventional operative care, and since controlling the caries process prior to first restoration is the key to breaking the repair cycle and improving care for patients, future research should address the shortcomings in the current level of supporting evidence for the various traditional preventive treatment options.","","","","1671fb74650683f1823a5ec500d6e51a2890bae0","","","","","","Traditional preventive treatment options.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1671fb74650683f1823a5ec500d6e51a2890bae0","","2009"

To test the hypothesis that fluoride prophylactic agents do not affect the fracture strength and fracture morphology of the tie-wing complex of ceramic brackets.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The fracture strength of the distal incisal tie-wing of two polycrystalline brackets, Clarity and Mystique, and a monocrystalline bracket, Inspire, was measured after the brackets were exposed to either Prevident, Phos-flur gel, or distilled water (control). Scanning electron microscopy was used to qualitatively evaluate the tie-wing intact and fractured surfaces.


RESULTS
A two-way analysis of variance and Fisher-Hayter post hoc test, alpha = .05, indicated a significant decrease in tie-wing fracture strength following both fluoride treatments when compared with the distilled water control only with the monocrystalline bracket. None of the bracket brands exhibited any qualitative differences in the tie-wing intact or fracture surfaces as a function of fluoride treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
The hypothesis is rejected. Based on the results, using topical fluoride agents with monocrystalline brackets might be contraindicated because of increased tie-wing fracture susceptibility.","","","","063b33987a3a1ed5d752039e5f0c743385ef3d17","","","","","","Fluoride prophylactic agents effect on ceramic bracket tie-wing fracture strength.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/063b33987a3a1ed5d752039e5f0c743385ef3d17","","2008"

To evaluate the effect of external bleaching on the color and luminosity of inactive white-spot lesions (WSLs) present after fixed orthodontic appliance treatment as means for achieving color matching of the WSLs with adjacent tooth surfaces.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ten patients with inactive WSLs after therapy with fixed orthodontic appliances were selected. At baseline, the lightness of maxillary incisors and canines was assessed with a colorimeter. Color determinations were performed in the area of the initial lesions (F1) and at adjacent, sound enamel areas (F2). Then, anterior teeth were bleached once with a bleaching gel for 60 minutes. After a break of 14 days, in-office bleaching was followed by a 2-week home bleaching period with daily home bleaching for 1 hour. After this, color determinations were repeated. Additionally, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire to provide information about their degree of contentment with the treatment.


RESULTS
The lightness values of both the F1 and F2 regions were significantly higher after bleaching as compared with baseline. F2 L-values increased significantly more as compared with F1, indicating a better color matching of these two areas in comparison with baseline. All patients were satisfied with the outcome of the bleaching therapy.

The buccal tooth surfaces of 51 subjects (>or=12 years), 24 males and 27 females, were examined with QLF for the presence of caries immediately after debonding (T0), and 6 weeks (T1), 6 months (T2), and 2 years (T3) thereafter. The fluorescence loss [Delta F (per cent)] and area [A (mm(2))] of any lesions were determined using dedicated software. The lesion development and influence of gender were determined by a general linear model (Friedman repeated-measures analysis and two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance). Using QLF, 370 carious surfaces were recorded at T0. During the study, 19 lesions were lost from QLF analysis of which 16 lesions (Delta F(0)=7.6-39.2 per cent) in two subjects were restored and three teeth with lesions were extracted or crowned. This resulted in 351 lesions that were included in this study with a median Delta F at T0 of 8.5 per cent (quartiles 6.6 per cent; 11.9 per cent). The lesions varied from incipient (Delta F<10 per cent, n=227) to advanced (Delta F>25 per cent, n=6). Overall, the lesions showed improvement between T0 and T2 (P<0.01) but no further significant improvement at T3. Thirty-five lesions became significantly worse after 2 years. The majority of lesions (n=171) were considered to be stable, and 145 lesions improved significantly of which only 10 lesions improved to such an extent that they disappeared. White spot lesions developed during orthodontic treatment have very limited ability to improve after appliance removal.

A new antimicrobial and fluoride-releasing self-etching bonding system (Clearfil Protect Bond) has been introduced in restorative dentistry and clinical studies have already shown the potential for this primer to be used clinically with effective antiplaque properties. Therefore, this in vitro study was conducted in order to evaluate the new primer in comparison with a conventional bonding preparation. One hundred and twenty extracted human teeth were randomly divided into three groups of 40 specimens each (20 incisors, 20 premolars). In group 1 a conventional bonding procedure was used (etching, Transbond XT), in group 2 the new primer was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations when bonding to intact enamel, while in group 3 the new primer was used without prior etching. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured with a universal testing machine and the adhesive remaining after debonding was determined using an optical microscope at x10 magnification. The adhesive remnant index was used in order to assess the mode of failure. No enamel fractures were detected in any of the specimens. In all groups acceptable bond strengths were observed. The only statistically significant difference (P = 0.004) was found for the incisors in group 2, which showed the highest mean SBS (17.46 MPa). Considering the acceptable bond strength and the mode of failure, use of the new primer without prior etching is recommended in patients with fixed appliances.

Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (dental braces) to correct the positions of teeth. It has been shown that the quality of treatment result obtained with fixed appliances is much better than with removable appliances. Fixed appliances are, therefore, favoured by most orthodontists for treatment. The success of a fixed orthodontic appliance depends on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being attached securely to the teeth so that they do not become loose during treatment. Brackets are usually attached to the front and side teeth, whereas bands (metal rings that go round the teeth) are more commonly used on the back teeth (molars). A number of adhesives are available to attach bands to teeth and it is important to understand which group of adhesives bond most reliably, as well as reducing or preventing dental decay during the treatment period.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bands to teeth during fixed appliance treatment, in terms of:(1) how often the bands come off during treatment; and(2) whether they protect the banded teeth against decay during fixed appliance treatment.


SEARCH METHODS
The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (searched 2 June 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library (searched 2 June 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 2 June 2016) and EMBASE Ovid (1980 to 2 June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) (including split-mouth studies) of adhesives used to attach orthodontic bands to molar teeth were selected. Patients with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) who had bands attached to molars were included.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
All review authors were involved in study selection, validity assessment and data extraction without blinding to the authors, adhesives used or results obtained. All disagreements were resolved by discussion.


MAIN RESULTS
Five RCTs and three CCTs were identified as meeting the review's inclusion criteria. All the included trials were of split-mouth design. Four trials compared chemically cured zinc phosphate and chemically cured glass ionomer; three trials compared chemically cured glass ionomer cement with light cured compomer; one trial compared chemically cured glass ionomer with a chemically cured glass phosphonate. Data analysis was often inappropriate within the studies meeting the inclusion criteria.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
There is insufficient high quality evidence with regard to the most effective adhesive for attaching orthodontic bands to molar teeth. Further RCTs are required.","","","","a4e064a70d0e759c7339cefed321f74462da0d3c","","","","","","Adhesives for fixed orthodontic bands.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4e064a70d0e759c7339cefed321f74462da0d3c","","2016"

"767",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","OBJECTIVE
Objectives of this study were to (1) compare the mean shear-peel bond strength of orthodontic bands luted to porcelain molar denture teeth with glass ionomer cement (GIC), resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC), or compomer cement; (2) assess the amount of cement remaining on the teeth after debanding; and (3) compare the survival times of the cemented bands subject to mechanical fatigue.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixty banded denture teeth (20 per cement group) were used to determine shear-peel bond strength, and 30 banded denture teeth (10 per cement group) were used to determine fatigue survival time. Shear-peel bond strength was determined with a universal testing machine, and groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance. The amount of cement remaining on the teeth after band removal was scored, and a chi-square test was used to compare groups. Fatigue testing was conducted in a ball mill, and a log-rank test was used to compare differences in survival times.


RESULTS
No differences were found in mean shear-peel bond strength among the three groups. The amount of cement remaining on the teeth varied between the compomer and GIC groups (P = .01), with more compomer cement remaining relative to GIC. The mean survival times of bands cemented with compomer or RMGIC were longer than for bands cemented with GIC (P < .001).


CONCLUSION
The findings show that on porcelain teeth the band cements have comparable mean shear-peel bond strengths, but that band retention with RMGIC and compomer cement are superior to GIC when subjected to simulated mechanical fatigue.","","","","a8cc62f01390e45ab4fba3f45e26ead42e0cd20a","","","","","","Three cements used for orthodontic banding of porcelain molars.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8cc62f01390e45ab4fba3f45e26ead42e0cd20a","","2007"
"768",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The shear bond strength (SBS) of a light-cured, resin-reinforced glass ionomer and a composite adhesive in combination with a self-etching primer was compared after different setting times to evaluate when orthodontic wires could be placed. Additionally, the fracture site after debonding was assessed using the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI). Eighty freshly extracted human premolars were used. Twenty teeth were randomly assigned to each of four groups: (1) brackets bonded with Transbond XT with a Transbond Plus etching primer and debonded within 5 minutes; (2) brackets bonded with Fuji Ortho LC and debonded within 5 minutes; (3) brackets bonded as for group 1 and debonded within 15 minutes; (4) brackets bonded as for group 2 and debonded within 15 minutes. The SBS of each sample was determined with an Instron machine. The mean SBS were, respectively: (1) 8.8 +/- 2 MPa; (2) 6.6 +/- 2.5 MPa; (3) 11 +/- 1.6 MPa and (4) 9.6 +/- 1.6 MPa. Interpolating the cumulative fracture probability by means of a Weibull analysis, the 10 per cent probabilities of fracture for the groups were found to be attained for shear stresses of 6.1, 3.1, 8.3 and 7.1 MPa, respectively. Chi-square testing of the ARI scores revealed that the nature of the remnant did not vary significantly with time, but the type of bonding material could generally be distinguished in leaving more or less than 10 per cent of bonding material on the tooth. After debonding, the Transbond system was likely to leave adhesive on at least 10 per cent of the bonded area of the tooth. The present findings indicate that brackets bonded with either Transbond XT in combination with Transbond Plus etching primer and Fuji Ortho LC had adequate bond strength at 5 minutes and were even stronger 15 minutes after initial bonding.","","","","87ed2fc9e646fe04b01a3a5f4722e97264d2ef79","","","","","","An in vitro comparison of the shear bond strength of a resin-reinforced glass ionomer cement and a composite adhesive for bonding orthodontic brackets.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87ed2fc9e646fe04b01a3a5f4722e97264d2ef79","","2005"

Materials and method Plain stainless steel bands were cemented to 350 human extracted third molar teeth using 1 of 7 different cements. Following complete cement cure, half of each sample group was exposed to mechanical stress in a ball mill. Stressed and unstressed samples were tested in tension and the stress at which initial cement failure recorded. The mode of failure was recorded using an adhesive remnant evaluation. Results The mean band retention stresses offered by the cements studied ranged from 0.96 to 1.56 MPa. Fuji OrthoTM provided the highest mean band retention stress in ‘stressed’ (1.56 MPa) and ‘unstressed’ (1.45 MPa) states. Exposure to mechanical stress did not appear to significantly influence band retention or mode of cement failure for most cements. Fuji OrthoTM cement recorded the highest Weibull modulus for all cements tested. Virtually all samples failed at either the cement/enamel or cement band interface. Conclusions Significant differences in band displacement stress values and mode of failure were demonstrated between the cements studied. However, generic comparisons were difficult to make.","","","","5966df387c8f88160d8d95a075f47a4579c0e376","","","","","","An Ex Vivo Evaluation of Resin-Modified Glass Polyalkenoates and Polyacid-Modified Composite Resins as Orthodontic Band Cements","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5966df387c8f88160d8d95a075f47a4579c0e376","","2004"

The survival time of bands was also assessed following simulated mechanical stress in a ball mill. One hundred and twenty molar bands were cemented to extracted human third molars. Eighty bands (20 cemented with each cement) were used to assess the debonding force and 40 bands (10 cemented with each cement) were used to determine survival time. The specimens were prepared in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions for each cement. After storage in a humidor at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, the shear debonding force was assessed for each specimen using a Nene M3000 testing machine with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. The predominant site of band failure was recorded visually for all specimens as either at the band/cement or cement/enamel interface. Survival time was assessed following application of mechanical stress in a ball mill. There was no significant difference in mean shear-peel bond strength between the cement groups (P = 0.816). The proportion of specimens failing at each interface differed significantly between cement groups (P < 0.001). The predominant site of bond failure for bands cemented with the RMGIC (Fuji Ortho LC) or the modified composite was at the enamel/cement interface, whereas bands cemented with 3M Multi-Cure failed predominantly at the cement/band interface. Conventional GIC specimens failed mostly at the enamel/cement interface. The mean survival time of bands cemented with either of the RMGICs or with the modified composite was significantly longer than for those cemented with the conventional GIC. The findings indicate that although there appears to be equivalence in the mean shear-peel bond strength of the band cements assessed, the fatigue properties of the conventional GIC when subjected to simulated mechanical stress seem inferior to those of the other cements for band cementation.","","","","2d489942748b9ee9a63a2289f3132fdbcbacaaa9","","","","","","Resin-modified glass ionomer, modified composite or conventional glass ionomer for band cementation?--an in vitro evaluation.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d489942748b9ee9a63a2289f3132fdbcbacaaa9","","2003"

"774",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Despite the advent of bonded attachments, preformed stainless steel bands are still routinely utilized in fixed appliance therapy. Banding offers superior reliability due to better resistance to occlusal interferences (Fricker, 1997). Band cements are necessary for band retention, either by assisting mechanical retention or by true adhesion. They also serve to seal a band to a tooth, filling the irregular gaps to prevent stagnation areas. Zinc phosphate cement was widely used for band cementation for much of the last century. It has high compressive strength, but suffers from low tensile strength and high solubility, resulting in micro-leakage and demineralisation. Zinc polycarboxylate cements were introduced to orthodontics in the early 1970s and offered the advantage of chemical adherence to enamel. However, physical and handling properties were flawed, due to poor tensile bond strength, solubility, viscosity, and short working time. Both zinc phosphate and polycarboxylate cements have been superceded by new generations of adhesive cements, and are now largely obsolete as banding cements.","","","","c4602fca6dca77d5b88fc26904785289a3f6f23d","","","","","","Orthodontic Banding Cements","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4602fca6dca77d5b88fc26904785289a3f6f23d","","2000"

Of the 114 known failures: 68 (60%) were from cement loss; 12 (10%) were from solder breakage; 11 (10%) were from split bands; and 13 (11%) were from reasons not specified. No statistical differences were noted between types of failures or between genders. Mean pooled survival times were 20 months for lingual arches and 23 months for Nance appliances, with no statistical differences between arches, except in successful appliances where Nance was superior (P = .011). Of the 114 failed appliances: 44 (39%) were not recemented or remade, which was considered clinically successful; 51 (45%) were recemented; and 19 (17%) were remade. Eight appliances were lost to follow-up or transferred.


CONCLUSION
The majority of bilateral space maintainers (72%) lasted their anticipated lifetimes.","","","","39678d022c533979d0621d565d721b8a8a07ffe0","","","","","","Bilateral space maintainers: a 7-year retrospective study from private practice.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39678d022c533979d0621d565d721b8a8a07ffe0","","2006"
"782",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a new glass polyphosphonate cement (Diamond) for orthodontic banding. Thirty-one subjects underwent in vivo testing to compare the failure rate of bands cemented using the test cement and bands cemented using a conventional glass polyalkenoate cement (Ketac-Cem) over a 6-month period at the beginning of active appliance therapy. In an ex vivo experiment 60 extracted teeth were banded using either the test cement or a glass polyalkenoate cement, and subjected to a debanding force using a Lloyd universal testing machine until failure. In the in vivo study the overall proportion of failure of the bands cemented with each cement was identical at 0.048. However, in the ex vivo study the probability of failure for the glass polyphosphonate cement was significantly higher than for the glass polyalkenoate cement, and the force to deband the glass polyalkenoate cement was greater than that of the glass polyphosphonate cement. In the clinical setting the new glass polyphosphonate cement performed as well as a conventional glass polyalkenoate cement, and these results suggest that it could be used as an alternative cement for orthodontic banding. The results of the ex vivo test bring into question the usefulness of this laboratory test as an indicator of clinical performance.","","","","faebe223cfea8ab82ef890dccc633bb5b0044801","","","","","","An in vivo and ex vivo study to evaluate the use of a glass polyphosphonate cement in orthodontic banding.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faebe223cfea8ab82ef890dccc633bb5b0044801","","2003"

The 3 orthodontic cement groups and the nonbanded control group were evaluated for cariopreventive potential. One hundred twenty extracted human molars were selected for banding, embedded in resin blocks, and randomly assigned to the following 4 groups: zinc phosphate cement, zinc polycarboxylate cement, resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), and nonbanded control. Orthodontic bands were placed and cemented; specimens were stored in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 30 days, thermocycled for 24 hours, and then debanded with a customized band-removal device attached to a universal testing machine. The cement was hand removed, and 2 coats of nail varnish were applied to the teeth, leaving a 2 x 2-mm window exposed on the buccal surface of the mesiobuccal cusp. The teeth were stored in lactic acid-gelatin solution for 4 weeks at 37 degrees C to develop simulated white spot decalcification in the window. The teeth were subjected to dye (10% methylene blue) for 24 hours and then sectioned through the window. The depth of dye penetration was determined and used as a measure of the cariopreventive effect of the banding cement. Data were analyzed with a 1-way ANOVA and a Tukey test for the multiple comparisons. Dye penetration occurred as follows: the zinc phosphate and control groups were about the same; there was less dye penetration with the zinc polycarboxylate, and the least with the resin-modified glass ionomer. The 2 fluoride-releasing cements (zinc polycarboxylate and RMGI) demonstrated less demineralization than the zinc phosphate in vitro and might provide greater protection from demineralization around a band periphery in clinical settings.","","","","73fcb6076eff279a326cc56796bd876c18e44617","","","","","","A comparison of in vitro enamel demineralization potential of 3 orthodontic cements.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73fcb6076eff279a326cc56796bd876c18e44617","","2002"

The effect of patient sex, patient age at the start of treatment, the presenting malocclusion, treatment mechanics, and the operator proficiency on band survival was also assessed. Data for 219 bands cemented with Band-Lok in 108 patients and for 395 bands cemented with AquaCem in 183 patients were analyzed. For each case, a single molar band, either the band that was first to fail or the band that had the shortest follow-up time, was chosen for analysis. For each cement, whether headgear was used or not, there was no significant difference in time to first band failure (P = .398). Twenty-six percent of patients had at least one band failure with Band-Lok, and 30% of patients had at least one band failure with AquaCem, representing an 18% band failure rate for each cement. There was no significant difference in time to first band failure for either cement with respect to sex of the patient (P = .842), patient age at the start of treatment (P = .257), presenting malocclusion (P = .319), or operator proficiency (P = .062). The use of headgear, however, reduced significantly the time to first band failure irrespective of cement type (P = .0069). Headgear use was identified as a predictor of first permanent molar band survival. Clinical performance of bands cemented with either cement appears to be similar and was influenced significantly by the use of headgear.","","","","883ce118b0a6d263f0161beeec91818915b1e8e7","","","","","","A clinical retrospective evaluation of 2 orthodontic band cements.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/883ce118b0a6d263f0161beeec91818915b1e8e7","","2009"

The 5 orthodontic cements evaluated were a zinc phosphate (Fleck's Cement), 2 resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGI)(3M Multicure glass ionomer and Optiband), and 2 polyacid-modified composite resin cements (PMCR)(Transbond Plus and Ultra Band Lok). Salivary contamination was examined with a polyacid-modified composite resin (Transbond Plus). Two hundred and eighty extracted human molar teeth were embedded in resin blocks and each was randomly assigned to the following 7 groups: 6 groups with factory etched bands, 5 cement groups and salivary contaminated group, and 1 in-office micro-etched group. The cemented teeth were put in deionized water at 37 degrees C for 30 days and thermocycled for 24 hours. The force required to break the cement bond was used as a measure of shear-peel band retention. With the use of an Instron testing machine, a shear-peel load was applied to each cemented band. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey test for the multiple comparisons. The RMGIs and PMCRs demonstrated significantly greater shear-peel band strengths compared to the zinc phosphate cement. No statistically significant differences were noted between the RMGI cement and PMCR cements and within the RMGI groups, however, there was a statistically significant difference within the PMCR groups. Significantly lower band strengths were noted with the saliva contaminated PMCR cement group (Transbond Plus) and the inpractice sandblasted PMCR group. Both RMGIs and PMCRs were found to demonstrate favorable banding qualities. The lower band strength with saliva-contaminated bands suggests that moisture control is critical when using a PMCR. The variability noted in the in-office micro-etched bands might be technique related.","","","","eb7f20d7f75b6abf7ac7c8fc0b789e0e76a3d6c5","","","","","","A comparison of shear-peel band strengths of 5 orthodontic cements.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb7f20d7f75b6abf7ac7c8fc0b789e0e76a3d6c5","","2009"

Materials and Methods Ten patients, between the ages of 19 and 33 years, in the initial stage of orthodontic treatment, were randomly designated to two groups using the split-mouth design ( n = 10). One group (GICEX) had bands cemented with GIC modified by CLX and a Control group (GIC), evaluated at time intervals before (T0), 3 months (T3), and 6 months (T6) after cementation. Total microbiological counts were performed, and color stability of tooth enamel, salivary pH, and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) were evaluated. Statistical Analysis The Friedman and Dunn’s tests, Mann–Whitney, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey, and paired and non-paired t -tests ( p < 0.05) were used. Results In T3, there was evidence of significant reduction in the quantity of colony forming unit (CFU) in GICEX group in comparison with the Control ( p = 0.041). In T6, the quantity of CFU was similar to the quantity in T3 and significantly different to control ( p = 0.045); Control group demonstrated a similar quantity of CFU between the experimental time intervals ( p = 0.066). Salivary pH demonstrated significant difference only between the time intervals T0 and T6 ( p = 0.022). The tooth enamel color ( p = 0.366) and ARI ( p = 0.343) values demonstrated no significant changes. Conclusion The incorporation of CLX into GIC demonstrated effective antibacterial action, allowed a good bond of the cement to the enamel, a high rate of survival of the bands, did not change the color of the tooth enamel, and maintained the salivary pH at physiological levels.","","","","ab5af53194510e502025584fe3cf9a4ba4e50358","","","","","","Analysis of Chlorhexidine Modified Cement in Orthodontic Patients: A Double-Blinded, Randomized, Controlled Trial","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab5af53194510e502025584fe3cf9a4ba4e50358","","2021"
"791",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","BACKGROUND
Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (dental braces) to correct the positions of teeth. The success of a fixed appliance depends partly on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being glued to the teeth so that they do not become detached during treatment. Brackets (metal squares) are usually attached to teeth other than molars, where bands (metal rings that go round each tooth) are more commonly used. Orthodontic tubes (stainless steel tubes that allow wires to pass through them), are typically welded to bands but they may also be glued directly (bonded) to molars. Failure of brackets, bands and bonded molar tubes slows down the progress of treatment with a fixed appliance. It can also be costly in terms of clinical time, materials and time lost from education/work for the patient. This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2011. A new full search was conducted on 15 February 2017 but no new studies were identified. We have only updated the search methods section in this new version. The conclusions of this Cochrane review remain the same.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bonded molar tubes, and the relative effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bonded molar tubes versus adhesives used to attach bands, during fixed appliance treatment, in terms of: (1) how often the tubes (or bands) come off during treatment; and (2) whether they protect the bonded (or banded) teeth against decay.


SEARCH METHODS
The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 15 February 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 15 February 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 15 February 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 15 February 2017). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials of participants with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) with molar tubes, bonded to first or second permanent molars. Trials which compared any type of adhesive used to bond molar tubes (stainless steel or titanium) with any other adhesive, were included.Trials were also included where:(1) a tube was bonded to a molar tooth on one side of an arch and a band cemented to the same tooth type on the opposite side of the same arch;(2) molar tubes had been allocated to one tooth type in one patient group and molar bands to the same tooth type in another patient group.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
The selection of papers, decision about eligibility and data extraction were carried out independently and in duplicate without blinding to the authors, adhesives used or results obtained. All disagreements were resolved by discussion.


MAIN RESULTS
Two trials (n = 190), at low risk of bias, were included in the review and both presented data on first time failure at the tooth level. Pooling of the data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands, with a hazard ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.80 to 4.72). No statistically significant heterogeneity was shown between the two studies. Data on first time failure at the patient level were also available and showed statistically different difference in favour of molar bands (risk ratio 2.30; 95% CI 1.56 to 3.41) (risk of event for molar tubes = 57%; risk of event for molar bands 25%).One trial presented data on decalcification again showing a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands. No other adverse events identified.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
From the two well-designed and low risk of bias trials included in this review it was shown that the failure of molar tubes bonded with either a chemically-cured or light-cured adhesive was considerably higher than that of molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement. One trial indicated that there was less decalcification with molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement than with bonded molar tubes cemented with a light-cured adhesive. However, given there are limited data for this outcome, further evidence is required to draw more robust conclusions.","","","","414e7e819c30bdd5a848b075dfb936112fbce6d9","","","","","","Adhesives for bonded molar tubes during fixed brace treatment.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/414e7e819c30bdd5a848b075dfb936112fbce6d9","","2017"

To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of three different resin-modified orthodontic band adhesives.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three resin-modified orthodontic band adhesives (Bisco Ortho Band Paste LC, Multi-Cure Glass Ionomer Band Cement, and Transbond Plus Light Cure Band Adhesive) were prepared and the samples were extracted in 3 mL of Basal Medium Eagle with 10% newborn calf serum for 24 hours. The L929 cells were plated (25,000 cells/mL) in wells of 96-well dishes and maintained in a humidified incubator for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO(2), and 95% air. After 24-hour incubation of the cells, the incubation medium was replaced by the immersed medium in which the samples were stored. Then L929 cells were incubated in contact with eluates for 24 hours. The cell mitochondrial activity was evaluated by the methyltetrazolium test. Twelve wells were used for each specimen, and methyltetrazolium tests were applied two times. The data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey Honestly Significantly Different tests.


RESULTS
Results with L929 fibroblasts demonstrated that all freshly prepared resin-modified orthodontic band adhesive materials reduced vital cell numbers (P > .05), in comparison to the control group. Our data demonstrate that all materials showed significant cytotoxicity compared to the control group.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that all materials showed significant cytotoxicity compared to the control group, and further studies using different test methods are needed for all resin-modified orthodontic band adhesives.","","","","5bc91ec62615a65709f3fc9bb0d34ffb78e34064","","","","","","Cytotoxic effects of resin-modified orthodontic band adhesives.

"799",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Dental cements and resins are used intraorally to secure fixed orthodontic devices. Although cements are still used, the popularity of resin and resin-cement hybrid materials is increasing because of their improved physical properties and low solubility in oral fluids. Some cements bond chemically to enamel, but bond strengths are low because cements are brittle and fracture cohesively. Resin adhesives penetrate micropores in etched enamel and mechanical retentions in orthodontic devices, resulting in higher bond strengths because resins are more fracture resistant than cements. Resins, however, do not bond well in the presence of moisture, and their attachment to surfaces is primarily mechanical. Hybridized materials combine the advantages of cements and resins but also have certain disadvantages. Optimal material selection and application require an understanding of the chemical differences and physical limitations of today's orthodontic cements, resins, and hybrid materials.","","","","68b8eed67149622f32d4d365de58712c2b79f618","","","","","","A review of orthodontic cements and adhesives.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68b8eed67149622f32d4d365de58712c2b79f618","","2001"

The review indicates that there is little support in the literature to suggest that the currently available conventional glass ionomer cements are suitable for routine clinical use in orthodontics. Dual- or tri-cured hybrid materials, however, comprising both glass ionomer and resin components, appear to have greater potential with regard to clinical performance.","","","","8f370d552ca0579cef312f65d2f0695a7a49677f","","","","","","Orthodontic bonding with glass ionomer cement--a review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f370d552ca0579cef312f65d2f0695a7a49677f","","1996"

To introduce a cariogenic challenge on Sound buccal enamel surface in vivo, specially designed orthodontic bands were attached to premolars scheduled for extraction for orthodontic reasons. The bands were modified by having two metal wires (0·8 mm in diameter) welded to the inner surface of the band to produce a space for plaque accumulation similar to that occurring under loose orthodontic bands. The bands were cemented with a zinc phosphate cement (Tenet®) an left in situ for 4 weeks. Of 22 premolar teeth banded in eight different patients, eight showed definite white spot lesions, eight showed definite faint enamel opacities, and six showed no discernable lesions. Examination of definite white spot lesions by scanning electron microscopy revealed characteristic patterns of initial tissue destruction. Focal holes and an accentuation of the perikymata were observed affecting the enamel surface zone, an area previously considered to remain relatively intact during the development of a caries lesion. The superficial nature of the caries lesions observed and the rapidly of their formation is significant in the clinical management of decalcified areas forming beneath orthodontics bands.","","","","807a040a3d2cd3616e1ca425081da74ef7fd011a","","","","","","A Scanning Electron Microscopic Study of Early Enamel Caries Formed in Vivo beneath Orthodontic Bands","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/807a040a3d2cd3616e1ca425081da74ef7fd011a","","1996"

The teeth were randomly divided into four groups containing 30 teeth each. Groups 1 and 3 were cemented using conventional GIC and groups 2 and 4 were cemented using ACP-containing orthodontic cement.

To investigate the causes of bonding failures of orthodontic brackets and tubes and the effect of premedicating for saliva reduction.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Premedication with atropine sulfate was administered randomly. Failure rate of brackets and tubes placed in a group of 158 consecutive patients was evaluated after a mean period of 67 weeks after bonding.


RESULTS
The failure rate in the group without atropine sulfate premedication was 2.4%. In the group with premedication, the failure rate was 2.7%. The Cox regression analysis of these groups showed that atropine application did not lead to a reduction in bond failures. Statistically significant differences in the hazard ratio were found for the bracket regions and for the dental assistants who prepared for the bonding procedure.


CONCLUSIONS
Premedication did not lead to fewer bracket failures. The roles of the dental assistant and patient in preventing failures was relevant. A significantly higher failure rate for orthodontic appliances was found in the posterior regions.","","","","ecc7729f31579a08fe7a954c7aebdc7c391c6bf8","","","","","","A retrospective survey of the causes of bracket- and tube-bonding failures.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ecc7729f31579a08fe7a954c7aebdc7c391c6bf8","","2017"

The amount of residual adhesive remaining on each tooth was evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analyses were done using two-way ANOVA. Results: RMGI bonded brackets had significantly lower SBS value compared to composite resin bonded groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between metal and ceramic brackets bonded with either the RMGI or composite resin. The comparison of the adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores between the groups indicated that the bracket failure mode was significantly different among groups (P<0.001) with more adhesive remaining on the teeth bonded with composite resin.

To compare the clinical performance of brackets bonded to anterior and posterior teeth, including second molars.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
One operator, using the straight-wire technique, bonded metallic brackets to the teeth of 127 consecutive patients. All patients were observed for 12 months during their regular orthodontic appointments. Bracket failures were recorded and summarized for statistical analysis. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to evaluate bracket failure rates.


RESULTS
Statistically significant differences in survival rates were observed between molar tubes and anterior brackets (P < .05). Twelve-month failure rates of incisor, canine, premolar, and molar brackets were 3.6, 1.6, 4.8, and 11.6%, respectively. The first and second molar did not show significant difference in bond failure. Young patients (age <18 years) showed a higher failure rate than old patients (≥18 years).


CONCLUSIONS
Brackets directly bonded to the buccal surfaces of molars failed significantly more often than those directly bonded to anterior teeth or premolars, but showed acceptable failure rate especially in adult patients. Bonding on second molars seems to be as reliable as bonding on the first molars.","","","","0e31a5a29958295a9e2f0f7122de06345e47c8f6","","","","","","Survival analysis of brackets and tubes: A twelve-month assessment.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e31a5a29958295a9e2f0f7122de06345e47c8f6","","2014"

Materials and Methods: The tested cements were exposed in vitro to mouse fibroblast cells for 1 h at 37°C. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were evaluated by means of the single cell gel (Comet Assay) and the trypan blue exclusion test, respectively. All data were assessed by the Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test, followed by Dunn's test. P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Results: Significant statistically differences (P < 0.05) in cytotoxicity were observed for both Vidrion C powder and liquid at the tested concentrations, with exception to the group presenting the lowest powder concentration. OptiBand similarly presented induced cellular death at the highest tested concentration for paste A (P < 0.05). Band-Lok paste B was also able to induce cytotoxicity at the highest tested concentration. Regarding the comet assay, Band-Lok paste B and OptiBand paste A resulted in increased DNA injury (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The obtained results support the thought that some glass ionomer cement components present both genotoxic and cytotoxic effects when in high concentrations. Since DNA damage and cellular death are important events during oncogenesis, this study represents relevant contribution to estimate the real risks induced by these materials upon cellular systems.","","","","ad18bf25bbdeb05df80729b9416fc5bc9cd1fbe6","","","","","","Orthodontic cements induce genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in mammalian cells in vitro","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad18bf25bbdeb05df80729b9416fc5bc9cd1fbe6","","2012"

"829",":Paper","CC-BY","The manifold uses of dental cements-as (a) luting agents, (b) cavity linings and bases, and (c) restorations for teeth—make them perhaps the most important materials in clinical dentistry. The research of the last 10 years has resulted in four main types, classified by matrix-forming species: (1) phosphate, (2) phenolate, (3) polycarboxylate, and (4) polymethacrylate. The zinc phosphate cements continue to be widely used for luting in an essentially unchanged form. Acidity and oral dissolution remain as problems. The zinc-oxide eugenol cements and their modifications are useful as linings and temporary materials but are susceptible to hydrolytic breakdown. Vanillate cements may be an improvement. Calcium hydroxide-salicylate cements are widely used as cavity linings, especially on exposures, and show improved resistance to acid dissolution. Polycarboxylate cements as both zinc polycarboxylate and glass-ionomer cements show adhesion potential, good physical properties, fluoride release, and, generally, good biological properties. Glass-ionomer cements when correctly manipulated show minimal oral dissolution. Polymethacrylate cements have been used principally for bonding etched cast metal restorations to etched enamel. Recently, adhesive crown-and-bridge cements have been developed. There are no well-established correlations between laboratory measurements of apparently relevant properties and clinical performance. More clinically-based research is needed to facilitate the development of new cements.","","","","c74aaf0943cbfef24a6866e1cd9d62048bfd1166","","","","","","Dental Cements","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c74aaf0943cbfef24a6866e1cd9d62048bfd1166","","1988"

Human molars were randomly divided into four groups (N = 40) according to the type of prophylactic pastes: control (no active ingredients), paste containing fluoride, paste containing ACP, and paste containing both fluoride and ACP. After prophylaxis, 20 brackets per group were bonded using an etch-and-rinse bonding technique (37% phosphoric acid and Ortho solo), and the other remaining 20 brackets were bonded using a self-etch bonding technique (Clearfil S(3)Bond). Samples were tested for tensile strength 24 hours after bonding using a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test with significance level at .05.


RESULTS
The mean tensile bond strength varied between 3.043 (ACP) and 9.232 (control) MPa. The etch-and-rinse bonding technique was significantly affected by pastes containing active ingredients (P < .001). The self-etching system was not significantly affected by different pastes (P > .05).


CONCLUSIONS
Cleaning enamel surfaces with prophylactic pastes that contain ACP and/or fluoride, prior to orthodontic bonding, resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the tensile bond strength of etch-and-rinse bonding technique.","","","","e316e7605c1d8f05865f5ea1c9aa90b91bfa9ba4","","","","","","Effect of prophylactic pastes containing active ingredients on the enamel-bracket bond strength of etch-and-rinse and self-etching systems.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e316e7605c1d8f05865f5ea1c9aa90b91bfa9ba4","","2011"

To evaluate bonding efficacy of activated Transbond Plus Self-Etching Primer (TPSEP) used at different time points with Transbond XT to bond metallic orthodontic brackets to bovine incisors.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The inferior incisors of 210 bovines were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 30). TPSEPs were mixed, activated, and kept activated for 30 (group 30), 21 (group 21), 15 (group 15), 7 (group 7), 3 (group 3), or 1 (group 1) days before bonding, and in one group (group 0) TPSEP was used immediately after mixed. At day zero, incisors in each group were bonded in exactly the same way. After applying TPSEP, brackets were bonded with Transbond XT, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 hours, shear bond strength (SBS) tests were performed for all samples at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min, and the Adhesive Remnant Index was scored.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the SBS of groups 0, 1, 3, 7, and 15 (P > .05) However, those groups had higher SBS (P < .05) compared with groups 21 and 30. No significant difference (P > .05) was observed between groups 21 and 30. Despite the decrease in SBS for groups 21 and 30, bond strength values were still satisfactory.


CONCLUSION
After activation, the TPSEP mix can be stored for a period of 15 days without losing its adhesive properties.","","","","0759fd035a743eea9b0a58054c2b569d26c24d84","","","","","","Shear bond strength of brackets bonded to enamel with a self-etching primer.

High-resolution silicone impressions were taken of the buccal tooth surfaces after etching for 30 seconds with 37% phosphoric acid. The impressions were replicated in epoxy resin and examined under high magnification in a scanning electron microscope. A 4-point classification system and histometric techniques were used to evaluate etch patterns on the enamel surfaces where orthodontic brackets were to be bonded. After impressions were made, all teeth (including first molars) were bonded with 0.022-in Andrews' prescription brackets (""A"" Company, San Diego, Calif) and Right-On composite (TP Orthodontics, Leeds, England). The first date of bond failure for each tooth was recorded; it varied from 1 to 806 days. An ideal etch pattern was found on less than 5% of the orthodontic bonding area; type C pattern (pitted enamel surface) occupied the greatest area. Overall, the failure rate was 55.8% over 26 months; the greatest failure rate occurred in first molars.

Two orthodontists using the edgewise technique participated in this study; 6113 brackets, including 20 molar tubes, were bonded with Fuji Ortho LC (GC, Europe, N.V. Leuven, Belgium) in 135 patients. Ceramic, metal, and resin brackets were tested, and both operators used the same bonding method for the brackets. The survival rate and the failure rate of the brackets were evaluated. The rates were determined by operator, bracket type, tooth position in the dental arch, and age and sex of the patients. Bracket survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier test. The Cox-Mantel statistical test with a level of significance set at 0.05 was used to compare survival curves. The chi-square test was used at a level of P < .05 to compare failure rates. The overall failure rate for the sample was 7%, and the overall survival rate was equal to 0.918. Age had no significant influence on the failure rate (P = .07); however, it had a significant influence on the survival rate (P < .01). The best survival rates were obtained in the groups aged 16 to 20 years (S[t] = 0.943) and older than 20 years (S[t] = 0.929). The difference between males and females was not statistically significant in terms of failure rate (P = .17). However, the Cox-Mantel test showed a higher bracket survival rate for the males (S[t] = 0.924) than for the females (S[t] = 0.839) (P < .00001). The influence of the operator was not statistically significant on the failure rate (P = .08); however, it was significant on the survival rate (P < .0002). Location in the arch had a significant influence on the failure and survival rates. The worst results were obtained in the upper incisors and the canines, and the best results in the lower premolars. Fifteen percent of the molar tubes failed; their survival rate was equal to 0.833. The failure rate was significantly greater for resin brackets than for metal or ceramic brackets (P = .007). The highest survival rate was obtained with ceramic brackets (P = .0001).

The effect of the patients' sex, age at the start of treatment and presenting malocclusion on bracket survival time was assessed also. Forty-five consecutive patients who attended for fixed appliance therapy were randomly selected. Four hundred twenty-six brackets were bonded (213 with compomer and 213 with resin adhesive) with a split mouth design; the right or left side allocation of compomer in either arch was alternated. Color transparencies of the maxillary incisors, mandibular incisors, or both, and transparencies of the canines, were taken before treatment. At the debond stage, the transparencies were projected (20x) and assessed by an experienced examiner, who used a caries index. The survival time distributions for brackets bonded with each bonding agent were not significantly different (P = .74, paired Prentice-Wilcoxon test; P = .75, Akritas test), with bracket failure rates of 17% and 20% recorded for compomer and resin adhesive, respectively. Neither the patients' sex (P = .85) nor malocclusion (P = .26) appear to affect significantly bracket survival, but patient age was identified as a useful prognostic indicator of bracket survival (P < .001). On average, there was more decalcification related to brackets bonded with resin adhesive than with compomer (P = .0075).

"843",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","In an experimental study the bond strength of stainless steel, ceramic and plastic brackets to bovine enamel was investigated by tensile testing. The brackets were cemented to the enamel using a conventional two-paste orthodontic bonding resin, a light-cured, fluoride-releasing adhesive, a no-mix-orthodontic bonding resin and a light-curing glass ionomer cement. For evaluation of the experimental data the Weibull analysis was applied. The highest values for the Weibull modulus (m) and the 10 per cent probability of failure (sigma.10) were found in the tested plastic brackets (Dentaurum Edgewise plastic bracket and Spirit bracket) using a no-mix orthodontic bonding resin (System 1). However, the tensile stresses for the 90 per cent probability of failure (sigma.90) were over 10 MPa and carried the danger of enamel fracture. Bracket bonding with glass ionomer cement cannot be recommended because of the low bond strength values for the 10 per cent probability of failure (sigma.10). The most favourable bracket-bonding system concerning the Weibull modulus (m), the 10 and 90 per cent probabilities of failure (sigma.10 and sigma.90) and aesthetics was the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured, fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding resin (Sequence). Bond fracture occurred predominantly between bracket and orthodontic bonding resin, with two exceptions. Concerning the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured glass ionomer cement (Photac Fil), there was no preferential site of failure. Regarding the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured, fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding resin (Sequence), bracket fracture was seen more often than bond separation between bracket and enamel. When the bond failure was located at the enamel-orthodontic bonding resin interface enamel prisms could be identified on the adhesive site by scanning electron microscopy.","","","","a826bae3cb881bef76a90b034d170b56d72a4237","","","","","","Evaluation of the bond strength of different bracket-bonding systems to bovine enamel.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a826bae3cb881bef76a90b034d170b56d72a4237","","1997"

Based on our previous pilot study, the objective of this extended study was to compare (a) casts to their corresponding digital ClinCheck® models at baseline and (b) the tooth movement achieved at the end of aligner therapy (Invisalign®) to the predicted movement in the anterior region.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pre- and post-treatment casts as well as initial and final ClinChecks® models of 50 patients (15-63 years of age) were analyzed. All patients were treated with Invisalign® (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Evaluated parameters were: upper/lower anterior arch length and intercanine distance, overjet, overbite, dental midline shift, and the irregularity index according to Little. The comparison achieved/predicted tooth movement was tested for equivalence [adjusted 98.57% confidence interval (- 1.00; + 1.00)].


RESULTS
Before treatment the anterior crowding, according to Little, was on average 5.39 mm (minimum 1.50 mm, maximum 14.50 mm) in the upper dentition and 5.96 mm (minimum 2.00 mm, maximum 11.50 mm) in the lower dentition. After treatment the values were reduced to 1.57 mm (minimum 0 mm, maximum 4.5 mm) in the maxilla and 0.82 mm (minimum 0 mm, maximum 2.50 mm) in the mandible. We found slight deviations between pretreatment casts and initialClinCheck® ranging on average from -0.08 mm (SD ± 0.29) for the overjet and up to -0.28 mm (SD ± 0.46) for the upper anterior arch length. The difference between achieved/predicted tooth movements ranged on average from 0.01 mm (SD ± 0.48) for the lower anterior arch length, up to 0.7 mm (SD ± 0.87) for the overbite. All parameters were significantly equivalent except for the overbite (-1.02; -0.39).


CONCLUSION
Performed with aligners (Invisalign®), the resolvement of the partly severe anterior crowding was successfully accomplished. Resolving lower anterior crowding by protrusion of the anterior teeth (i.e., enlargement of the anterior arch length) seems well predictable. The initial ClinCheck® models provided high accuracy compared to the initial casts. The achieved tooth movement was in concordance with the predicted movement for all parameters, except for the overbite.","","","","68ae2ce6c5f89baeae78dcfff5e512629abce36d","","","","","","Invisalign® treatment in the anterior region: were the predicted tooth movements achieved?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68ae2ce6c5f89baeae78dcfff5e512629abce36d","","2012"

The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature to determine the treatment effects of the Invisalign orthodontic system (Align Technology), Santa Clara, Calif.).


TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED
The authors reviewed clinical trials that assessed Invisalign's treatment effects in nongrowing patients. They did not consider trials involving surgical or other simultaneous fixed or removable orthodontic treatment interventions.


RESULTS
The authors searched electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, EMBASE Excerpta Medica, Thomsen's ISI Web of Science and LILACS) with the help of a senior health sciences librarian. They used ""Invisalign"" as the sole search term, and 22 documents appeared in the combined search. Thereafter, they used ""clinical trials,"" ""humans"" and ""Invisalign treatment effects"" as abstract selection criteria. Only two published articles met these inclusion criteria, though after reading the actual articles, the authors determined that they did not adequately evaluate Invisalign treatment effects. Both articles identified methodological issues.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
The inadequately designed studies the authors found represented only a lower level of evidence (level II). Therefore, the authors found that no strong conclusions could be made regarding the treatment effects of Invisalign appliances. Future prospective randomized clinical trials are required to support, with sound scientific evidence, the claims about Invisalign's treatment effects. Clinicians will have to rely on their Invisalign clinical experience, the opinions of experts and the limited published evidence when using Invisalign appliances.","","","","0b91cc971d48da6c0af03d33437a93a203a291e3","","","","","","The treatment effects of Invisalign orthodontic aligners: a systematic review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b91cc971d48da6c0af03d33437a93a203a291e3","","2005"
"858",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","OBJECTIVES
To investigate in a numerical study the effect of the geometry and the extension of orthodontic aligner edges and the aligner thickness on force transmission to upper right central incisor tooth (Tooth 11).


METHODS
A three-dimensional (3D) digital model, obtained from a 3D data set of a complete dentulous maxilla, was imported into 3-matic software. Aligners with four different trimming line designs (scalloped, straight, scalloped extended, straight extended) were designed, each with four different thicknesses (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mm). The models were exported to a finite element (FE) software (Marc/Mentat). A facial 0.2 mm bodily malposition of tooth 11 was simulated.


RESULTS
The maximum resultant force was in the range of (7.5 - 55.2) N. The straight trimming designs had higher resultant force than the scalloped designs. The resultant force increases with increasing the edge extension of the aligner. The normal contact forces were unevenly distributed over the entire surface and were concentrated in six areas: Incisal, Mesio-Incisal, Disto-Incisal, Middle, Mesio-Cervical, and Disto-Cervical. The resultant force increases super linearly with increasing thickness.


CONCLUSIONS
The design of the trimming line, the edge extension, and the thickness of the aligner affect significantly the magnitude of the resultant force and the distribution of normal contact force. The straight extended trimming design exhibited better force distribution that may favor a bodily tooth movement.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
A straight extended trimming design of an orthodontic aligner may improve the clinical outcomes. In addition, the manufacturing procedures of the straight design are much simpler compared to the scalloped design.","","","","eacc04c1f0d8b4e95b3d100abc41d2fbd50e76b8","","","","","","Effect of trimming line design and edge extension of orthodontic aligners on force transmission: A 3D finite element study.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eacc04c1f0d8b4e95b3d100abc41d2fbd50e76b8","","2023"

Maxillary molar distalization is a clinical orthodontics procedure used to move the first maxillary molar distally. The procedure is useful in patients with some Class II malocclusion allowing the first molar to move into a Class I relationship and the correction of associated malocclusion features. Three finite element models were designed to simulate the alveolar bone, molar tooth, periodontal ligament, aligner, and composite attachments. The first model had no composite attachment, the second model had a vertical rectangular attachment, and the third model had a newly designed attachment. A loading method was developed that mimicked the aligner's molar distal movement. PDL was set as a viscoelastic material with a nonlinear mechanical response. von Mises and maximum principal stresses and tooth displacement patterns were analyzed using dedicated software. All the configurations showed some form of clockwise rotation in addition to the distal movement. The crown portion of the tooth showed maximum displacement in all three models; however, in the absence of attachment, the root apex moved in the opposite direction which was compatible with uncontrolled tipping movement. Simulations with attachments exhibited the best performance regarding the movement patterns. The third group, with the newly designed attachment, exhibited the best performance concerning stress distribution (principal stress and von Mises stresses) and higher stresses in the periodontal ligament and tooth. Incorporating a vertical rectangular attachment in a clear aligner resulted in the reduction of mesiodistal tipping tendency during molar distalization. The third model was the most efficient considering both displacement pattern and stress distribution. The level of stress generated by the third model needs to be further investigated in future studies.","","","","5dfbdb95d2f3aea290eac61a63cb855946b8cb09","","","","","","Effects of Variable Composite Attachment Shapes in Controlling Upper Molar Distalization with Aligners: A Nonlinear Finite Element Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dfbdb95d2f3aea290eac61a63cb855946b8cb09","","2021"

Materials and Methods: Three finite element models of maxilla and maxillary dentition were developed. In the first model, thermoplastic aligner without any auxiliaries was used. In the second and third models, thermoplastic aligner with horizontal ellipsoid composite attachment and power ridge were used, respectively. The software used for the study was ANSYS 14.5 FE. A force of 100 g was applied to torque the upper right central incisor. The resultant force transfer, stress distribution, and tooth displacement were evaluated. Results: The overall tooth displacement and stress distribution appeared high in the model with power ridge, whereas the root movement was more in the horizontal ellipsoid composite attachment model. The model without any auxillaries produced least root movement and stress distribution. Conclusion: Horizontal ellipsoid composite attachment achieved better torque of central incisor than the model with power ridge and model without any auxillaries.","","","","72cf14664415745f2b4acfe2a8e227daa2388b67","","","","","","Biomechanical Effects of Torquing on Upper Central Incisor with Thermoplastic Aligner: A Comparative Three-Dimensional Finite Element Study with and Without Auxillaries","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72cf14664415745f2b4acfe2a8e227daa2388b67","","2021"

Materials and Methods A full maxillary arch (14 teeth) was modelled by combining two different imaging techniques: cone beam computed tomography and surface-structured light scan. The appliance and auxiliary element geometries were created by exploiting computer-aided design (CAD) procedures. The reconstructed digital models were imported within the finite element solver (Ansys® 17). For the extrusion movement, the authors compared the aligner without an attachment with three auxiliary-aligner designs: a rectangular palatal attachment, a rectangular buccal attachment, and an ellipsoid buccal attachment. The resulting force-moment (MF) system delivered by the aligner to the target tooth and the tooth displacement were calculated for each scenario. Results The maximum tooth displacement along the z-axis (0.07 mm) was obtained with the rectangular palatal attachment, while the minimum (0.02 mm) was obtained without any attachments. With the ellipsoid attachment, the highest undesired moments Mx and My were found. The rectangular palatal attachment showed the highest Fz (2.0 N) with the lowest undesired forces (Fx = 0.4 N; Fy = −0.2 N). Conclusions FEA demonstrated that the rectangular palatal attachment can improve the effectiveness of the appliance for the extrusion of an upper central incisor.","","","","1f97896f3d198b154c175041272ea149e32ee450","","","","","","Biomechanical Effects of Different Auxiliary-Aligner Designs for the Extrusion of an Upper Central Incisor: A Finite Element Analysis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f97896f3d198b154c175041272ea149e32ee450","","2019"

Methods A three-dimensional model of the maxillary bone, maxillary right central incisor, lateral incisor and canine was designed based on the average dimensions of the anatomy and morphology given by Wheeler’s and standard edgewise bracket with Slot of 0.022″ X 0.028″ inch was designed using the finite element method. Brackets were placed on each tooth, on the mentioned labial surface at variable distances from the cusp tip, and a full size archwire was virtually engaged into the bracket, then optimum orthodontic load of 2N is applied and PDL stress were calculated. Results The lowest stress values were measured as bracket position changes from crest of teeth to the apical direction. By displacing the bracket gingivally from 1.5 to 6 mm, a 16.2% decrease in stress level for central incisor, for lateral incisor the stress level decrease by 25.8% and for canine the stress level decrease by 21.6% thus our study confirms that variation in vertical bracket position results in change in resultant stress in PDL. Conclusion It can be concluded that the variation in the vertical position of the bracket osn different tooth can have an important effect on the stresses developed in the PDL.","","","","118b3c10196d7519e4fa82b66d9d2146129a9731","","","","","","The effect of tooth morphology and vertical bracket positioning on resultant stress in periodontal ligament - a three dimensional finite element study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/118b3c10196d7519e4fa82b66d9d2146129a9731","","2019"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the various archwire characteristics like the friction coebetween bracket and archwire, the cross-section shape, and the cross-section dimension, on the displacement and the periodontal ligament (PDL) stresses of canine’s movement in a self-ligating treatment using the finite element (FE) analysis method. METHODS: Models of teeth and their supporting tissues, brackets and archwires were constructed. Ten kinds of archwires were used for the simulation. RESULTS: Considering the translation movement, the maximum displacement, highest stress, and Rc⁢r increased with an increase in the cross-section area. The maximum displacement and highest stress increased with an increase in the friction coefficient. The Rc⁢r values increased with an increase in the friction coefficient in the round archwires, while decreased with an increase in the rectangular archwires. However, these change tends were different in rotation and inclination movement. CONCLUSION: The archwire characteristics (round archwire, rectangular archwire, cross-section area, and friction coefficient) exhibited different effects on the tooth translation, rotation, and inclination. Our results can assist in the improvement of the self-ligating orthodontic treatment.","","","","af223afde3be16266072c58e5afff040319e20a6","","","","","","A three-dimensional finite element analysis of the effect of archwire characteristics on the self-ligating orthodontic tooth movement of the canine","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af223afde3be16266072c58e5afff040319e20a6","","2019"

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate a methodology for quantitatively evaluating OTP, using theoretical analyses, orthodontic forces measurement (OFM) and finite element method (FEM). METHODS: An OTP was theoretically designed based on a clinical case and forces on incisors in OTP were measured on a specialized platform. Further, FEM simulations were performed on the designed OTP and control group. At last, an 18-month tracking was carried out to observe treatment effects of the designed OTP. RESULTS: The moving tendencies of incisors were in keeping with ideal treatment from the designed OTP through FEM; the maximal hydrostatic stress and logarithmic strain in periodontal ligament (PDL) decreased by 26.81% and 32.60% compared to the control group. Clinical feedback indicated that a controllable correction of incisors was realized after 18 months, which was in accord with the FEM result and root/bone resorption by reason of stress/strain reduction on PDL did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanical responses of periodontium can be quantitatively estimated using OTM and FEM. This study provided an alternative technological mean for the predictability and optimization of clinical OTP.","","","","30879b5c811f47d76ac24b6294b67d8e30a91700","","","","","","Biomechanical investigation of orthodontic treatment planning based on orthodontic force measurement and finite element method before implementation: A case study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30879b5c811f47d76ac24b6294b67d8e30a91700","","2018"

Maxillary models with the upper teeth, clear aligners, and composite attachments placed on the labial surface of the upper right central incisor were constructed. Four models were created to simulate upper central incisor extrusion: (1) without any composite attachment; (2) rectangular beveled attachment; (3) ellipsoid attachment; and (4) horizontal rectangular attachment. Clear aligners were designed to perform upper central incisor extrusion. The constructed models were analyzed using the finite element method. Initial displacement and stress distribution were analyzed. Output analysis found that the upper right central incisor in the model with a horizontal rectangular attachment had the greatest extrusive movement, followed by the model with ellipsoid attachment and the model with beveled attachment. Maximum compressive stress was seen at the cervical region of the composite attachment. Composite attachments including horizontal rectangular attachment, ellipsoid attachment, and rectangular beveled attachment can be used to perform upper central incisor extrusion.","","","","e15af01d735e9e2ed4f3e4768e58803574662de9","","","","","","Initial Displacement and Stress Distribution of Upper Central Incisor Extrusion with Clear Aligners and Various Shapes of Composite Attachments Using the Finite Element Method","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e15af01d735e9e2ed4f3e4768e58803574662de9","","2022"

Although aligners have undergone considerable improvements over time, to date they have limitations in resolving the most serious malocclusions related to transverse maxillary deficiency. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate an orthodontic protocol (the Nuvola® OP System) which associates a morpho-functional corrector (to be used for 30 min/day) with the aligner, allowing for the treatment of cases that would be difficult or unpredictable with aligners alone. Methods: Linear measurements were taken on STL files of 100 patients. In 77 patients between 18 and 55 years (mean 28.6 ± 16.2 (standard deviation) years), 3D superimpositions of the maxilla obtained from intraoral scans before and after treatment were performed in order to evaluate the degree of maxillary expansion. The normality of the data distribution was tested. The pre- and post-treatment data were compared using a paired t-test with a 5% significance level. After treatment, a questionnaire was proposed to assess patients’ degree of satisfaction and compliance. Results: A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) for each distance evaluated was found. The maximum expansion was obtained at the first molar level (2.35 ± 1.64 mm). Of the subjects who completed the questionnaire, 96% were satisfied and 90% were able to perform the protocol without difficulty for the required duration. Conclusions: A significant expansion of the maxillary arch as well as a high degree of patient satisfaction and compliance were observed with the Nuvola® OP System. Further studies are needed in order to clinically evaluate the relative contribution of the aligners and morpho-functional device to the obtained expansion.","","","","7330a0a8e1f05a95456a7d9fcd5615d6b6db87df","","","","","","Clinical Use of Aligners Associated with Nuvola® OP System for Transverse Maxillary Deficiency: A Retrospective Study on 100 Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7330a0a8e1f05a95456a7d9fcd5615d6b6db87df","","2022"

(2) Methods: Fifteen patients who underwent orthodontic treatment using directly printed clear aligners were recruited. The study sample included 12 maxillary and 10 mandibular arches, whose pre-treatment, predicted and post-treatment digital models were superimposed on the untreated posterior teeth by means of a best-fit surface-based registration, which was also used to transfer three anatomical landmarks, digitally labeled on the crown of each anterior moving tooth, from the pre-treatment to the predicted and post-treatment models. The Teeth Alignment Performance (TAP) index, quantifying how close the final landmarks were to their expected final position, was proposed as an accuracy index of both individual tooth and group of teeth movement, and its inter-examiner repeatability was tested. (3) Results: No systematic inter-rater discrepancy associated with TAP was observed (p > 0.05), not even when a slight systematic inter-rater difference in landmark labelling was detected (for the upper central incisors, p < 0.001). In addition, all Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values showed excellent inter-rater agreement (>0.95), and the small Random Error of Measurement (REM), ranging from 1% for the arch TAP to 3% for the lower canine TAP, indicated that this accuracy index is highly repeatable.

Data sources: Seven databases of published and unpublished literature were searched up to 4 August 2020 for eligible studies. Data selection: Studies were deemed eligible if they included evaluation of rotational tooth movement with any type of aligner, through the comparison of software-based and actually achieved data after patient treatment. Data extraction and data synthesis: Data extraction was done independently and in duplicate and risk of bias assessment was performed with the use of the QUADAS-2 tool. Random effects meta-analyses with effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed and the quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE. Results: Seven articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, of which three contributed to meta-analyses. Overall results revealed a non-accurate prediction of the outcome for the software-based data, irrespective of the use of attachments or interproximal enamel reduction (IPR). Maxillary canines demonstrated the lowest percentage accuracy for rotational tooth movement (three studies: effect size = 47.9%; 95% CI = 27.2–69.5; P < 0.001), although high levels of heterogeneity were identified (I2: 86.9%; P < 0.001).

To evaluate the accuracy of Invisalign technology in achieving predicted tooth positions with respect to tooth type and direction of tooth movement.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The posttreatment models of 30 patients who had nonextraction Invisalign treatment were digitally superimposed on their corresponding virtual treatment plan models using best-fit surface-based registration. The differences between actual treatment outcome and predicted outcome were computed and tested for statistical significance for each tooth type in mesial-distal, facial-lingual, and occlusal-gingival directions, as well as for tip, torque, and rotation. Differences larger than 0.5 mm for linear measurements and 2° for angular measurements were considered clinically relevant.


RESULTS
Statistically significant differences (P < .05) between predicted and achieved tooth positions were found for all teeth except maxillary lateral incisors, canines, and first premolars. In general, anterior teeth were positioned more occlusally than predicted, rotation of rounded teeth was incomplete, and movement of posterior teeth in all dimensions was not fully achieved. However, except for excess posttreatment facial crown torque of maxillary second molars, these differences were not large enough to be clinically relevant.


CONCLUSIONS
Although Invisalign is generally able to achieve predicted tooth positions with high accuracy in nonextraction cases, some of the actual outcomes may differ from the predicted outcomes.

To investigate differences in case selection, treatment management, and aligner treatment expertise between orthodontists and general practitioners.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A parallel pair of original surveys with three sections (case selection, treatment management, and demographics) was sent to orthodontists (N = 1000) and general dentists (N = 1000) who were providers of aligner treatment.


RESULTS
Orthodontists had treated significantly more patients with aligners, had treated more patients with aligners in the previous 12 months, and had received more aligner training than general dentists (P < .0001). In general, case confidence increased with increasing experience for both orthodontists and general dentists. After adjusting for experience, there was a significant difference in aligner case confidence between orthodontists and general dentists for several malocclusions. General dentists were more confident than orthodontists in treating deep bite, severe crowding, and Class II malocclusions with aligners (P ≤ .0001). Significant differences were also found for all treatment management techniques except interproximal reduction.


CONCLUSION
There was a significant difference in case selection, treatment management, and aligner expertise between orthodontists and general dentists, although the differences in case selection were small. Overall, it was shown that orthodontists and general dentists elected to treat a variety of moderate to severe malocclusions with aligners but with different utilization of recommended auxiliaries, perhaps demonstrating a difference in treatment goals.","","","","57870942bd36a018c9f44c1fc0b281d7a70bafde","","","","","","Treatment management between orthodontists and general practitioners performing clear aligner therapy.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57870942bd36a018c9f44c1fc0b281d7a70bafde","","2017"

To investigate the predictability of arch expansion using Invisalign.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixty-four adult white patients were selected to be part of this retrospective study. Pre- and posttreatment digital models created from an iTero scan were obtained from a single orthodontist practitioner. Digital models from Clincheck were also obtained from Align Technology. Linear values of upper and lower arch widths were measured for canines, premolars, and first molars at two different points: lingual gingival margins and cusp tips. A paired t-test was used to compare expansion planned on Clincheck with the posttreatment measurements. Variance ratio tests were used to determine if a larger change planned was associated with larger error.


RESULTS
For every maxillary measurement, there was a statistically significant difference between Clincheck and final outcome (P < .05), with prediction worsening toward the posterior region of the arch. For the lower arch measurements at the gingival margin, there was a statistically significant difference between the Clincheck planned expansion and the final outcome (P < .05). Points measured at the cusp tips of the lower arch teeth showed nonstatistically significant differences between Clincheck prediction and the final outcome (P > .05). Variance ratios for upper and lower arches were significant (P < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
The mean accuracy of expansion planned with Invisalign for the maxilla was 72.8%. The lower arch presented an overall accuracy of 87.7%. Clincheck overestimates expansion by body movement; more tipping is observed. Overcorrection of expansion in the posterior region of the maxillary arch seems appropriate.","","","","02fbd21a2a07c3ac0236b8193edd0c75633f541d","","","","","","The predictability of transverse changes with Invisalign.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02fbd21a2a07c3ac0236b8193edd0c75633f541d","","2017"

To investigate changes in mandibular incisor position resulting from Invisalign correction of the crowded dentition without extraction.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective chart review was completed on 61 adult White patients. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the value of pretreatment crowding of the lower dentition: 20 mild (2.0-3.9 mm), 22 moderate (4.0-5.9 mm), and 19 severe (>6.0 mm). Cephalometric radiographs were measured to determine lower incisor changes. Interproximal reduction and changes in arch width were also measured. Statistical evaluation of T0 and T1 values using paired t-tests and analysis of covariance were applied to evaluate mean value changes.


RESULTS
Lower incisor position and angulation changes were statistically significant in the severe crowding group. There were no statistically significant differences in lower incisor position between the mild and moderate crowding groups. There was a statistically significant increase in buccal expansion in each of the three groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Invisalign(®) treatment can successfully resolve mandibular arch crowding using a combination of buccal arch expansion, interproximal reduction, and lower incisor proclination. When there is <6 mm of crowding, lower incisor position remained relatively stable. The lower incisors proclined and protruded in the more severely crowded dentitions (>6 mm).","","","","3d53f6ead58635689181cc6db963886da341dd14","","","","","","Changes in mandibular incisor position and arch form resulting from Invisalign correction of the crowded dentition treated nonextraction.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d53f6ead58635689181cc6db963886da341dd14","","2016"

To compare the mandibular incisor proclination produced by fixed labial appliances and third generation clear aligners.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients underwent a course of orthodontic treatment using either fixed labial appliances or clear aligners (Invisalign). Mandibular incisor proclination was measured by comparing pretreatment and near-end treatment lateral cephalograms. Eligibility criteria included adult patients with mild mandibular incisor crowding (<4 mm) and Class I skeletal bases (ANB, 1-4°). The main outcome was the cephalometric change in mandibular incisor inclination to the mandibular plane at the end of treatment. Eligible patients picking a sealed opaque envelope, which indicated their group allocation, was used to achieve randomization. Data was analyzed using a Welch two-sample t-test.


RESULTS
Forty-four patients (mean age, 26.4 ± 7.7 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the fixed labial appliance or the clear aligner group. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups: Fixed appliance mean crowding was 2.1 ± 1.3 mm vs clear aligner mean crowding, 2.5 ± 1.3 mm; pretreatment mean mandibular incisor inclination for the fixed appliance group was 90.8 ± 5.4° vs 91.6 ± 6.4° for the clear aligner group. Fixed appliances produced 5.3 ± 4.3° of mandibular incisor proclination. Clear aligners proclined the mandibular incisors by 3.4 ± 3.2°. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P > .05).


CONCLUSION
There was no difference in the amount of mandibular incisor proclination produced by clear aligners and fixed labial appliances in mild crowding cases.","","","","7583c1bfce81d438eed092dcafd7b6159eefa860","","","","","","A randomized clinical trial comparing mandibular incisor proclination produced by fixed labial appliances and clear aligners.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7583c1bfce81d438eed092dcafd7b6159eefa860","","2016"

"895",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","BACKGROUND
Clear aligner treatment (CAT) has been cited as a safe and comfortable orthodontic procedure for adult patients. However, the available evidence is scarce.


OBJECTIVE
To perform a systematic review of the existing literature in order to assess periodontal health during CAT.


SEARCH METHODS AND SELECTION CRITERIA
Pubmed, Pubmed Central, National Library of Medicine's Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical trials, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Google Scholar, and LILACS were searched from January 1945 to September 2014 to identify all peer-reviewed papers potentially relevant to the review.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
After duplicate selection and extraction procedures, the risk of bias was assessed according to the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination criteria, and a 3-point grading system, as described by the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU), was used to rate the methodological quality of the selected papers. A PICOS table was used for data extraction.


RESULTS
Five relevant articles were selected from the 1247 identified articles. The level of evidence was moderate for all the studies. A significant improvement of the periodontal health indexes was revealed, in particular when CAT was compared to fixed appliances. No periodontal CAT adverse effects were observed in the selected studies.


CONCLUSIONS
Periodontal health indexes were significantly improved during CAT. The results of this review should be interpreted with some caution because of the number, quality, and heterogeneity of the included studies.","","","","460ef977f972f8fda549a226f65e93399d95113a","","","","","","Periodontal health during clear aligners treatment: a systematic review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/460ef977f972f8fda549a226f65e93399d95113a","","2015"

To assess the scientific evidence related to the efficacy of clear aligner treatment (CAT) in controlling orthodontic tooth movement.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
PubMed, PMC, NLM, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Google Scholar, and LILACs were searched from January 2000 to June 2014 to identify all peer-reviewed articles potentially relevant to the review. Methodological shortcomings were highlighted and the quality of the studies was ranked using the Cochrane Tool for Risk of Bias Assessment.


RESULTS
Eleven relevant articles were selected (two Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT), five prospective non-randomized, four retrospective non-randomized), and the risk of bias was moderate for six studies and unclear for the others. The amount of mean intrusion reported was 0.72 mm. Extrusion was the most difficult movement to control (30% of accuracy), followed by rotation. Upper molar distalization revealed the highest predictability (88%) when a bodily movement of at least 1.5 mm was prescribed. A decrease of the Little's Index (mandibular arch: 5 mm; maxillary arch: 4 mm) was observed in aligning arches.


CONCLUSIONS
CAT aligns and levels the arches; it is effective in controlling anterior intrusion but not anterior extrusion; it is effective in controlling posterior buccolingual inclination but not anterior buccolingual inclination; it is effective in controlling upper molar bodily movements of about 1.5 mm; and it is not effective in controlling rotation of rounded teeth in particular.

To compare three-dimensional (3D) ClinCheck™ models with the subjects' actual 3D posttreatment models using the American Board of Orthodontics Objective Grading System (OGS).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective, within-subject study included 27 consecutive cases treated with aligner therapy. The posttreatment plaster models taken immediately after treatment were scanned and converted to stereolithography (STL) files; the ClinCheck models were also converted to STL format. MeshLab software was used to measure the seven components of the OGS, including alignment, marginal ridges, buccolingual inclinations, occlusal contacts, occlusal relationships, overjet and interproximal contacts. An overall OGS deduction score was also calculated.


RESULTS
Compared with the posttreatment models, the ClinCheck models showed significantly (P  =  .016) fewer overall OGS point deductions (24 vs 15). These overall differences were due to significantly (P < .05) more deductions among the posttreatment models than the ClinCheck models for alignment (4.0 vs 1.0 deductions), buccolingual inclinations (4.0 vs 3.0 deductions), occlusal contacts (3.0 vs 2.0 deductions), and occlusal relations (4.0 vs 2.0 deductions).


CONCLUSION
The ClinCheck models do not accurately reflect the patients' final occlusion, as measured by the OGS, at the end of active treatment.","","","","34a44c3ee6cbb51ee1b679e9d8e4c3129685f388","","","","","","Predicted and actual end-of-treatment occlusion produced with aligner therapy.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34a44c3ee6cbb51ee1b679e9d8e4c3129685f388","","2015"

To analyze adaptational changes in clear aligner fit after intraoral usage at different sets of time.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eight Invisalign appliances (Align Technology, San Jose, California, USA) were collected after intraoral usage. Acrylic imprints of the lower incisor region were constructed for each appliance at T0 (unused appliance). Two appliances were then used intra-orally for each of the following defined periods of time: 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, or 15 days. Used aligners were adapted on its T0 imprint and both were sectioned buccolingually from the distal surfaces of each incisor at the attachment area. Eight surfaces were collected for each set of time (n = 32 surfaces). Microphotographs of obtained sections and micrometric measurements of aligner fit were recorded at five different levels using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mean values of the fit changes (gap width) and group comparisons were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests. Significance level was set at P < .05.


RESULTS
Highly significant differences in aligner fit were found at the different time points assessed (P < .001) with the least mean gap width at 15 days (176 ± 98 μm) and the highest at 7 days (269 ± 145 μm). Significant differences in aligner fit at different attachment levels were also found (P < .01) with the least mean gap width at the middle of the labial surface of the attachment (187 ± 118 μm).


CONCLUSIONS
The 15-day period of intraoral aligner wear might still be recommended as it showed the best adaptation and least gap width between the aligner and the attachment.","","","","f500a85a178a5f9ac3274c75eb86db71591290d0","","","","","","Adaptational changes in clear aligner fit with time.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f500a85a178a5f9ac3274c75eb86db71591290d0","","2021"

Methods Six sets of clear aligners were designed for differential en-masse retraction and/or intrusion procedures in a first premolar extraction model. Group A0 was a control group with no activation. Groups A1–5 underwent different degrees of retractions and/or intrusions. Each group consisted of 10 aligners. Aligner forces were measured on a multi-axis force/torque transducer measurement system in real-time. Results In the en-masse retraction groups (A1 and A2), lingual and extrusive forces were observed on the incisors; the canines mainly received distal forces; intrusive forces were seen on the second premolars; and the molars received mesial forces. In the en-masse retraction and intrusion groups (A3, A4, and A5), incisors also received lingual and extrusive forces; canines received distal and intrusive forces; mesial and extrusive forces were seen on the second premolars; and the second molars received distal and intrusive forces. The vertical forces on the incisors did not differ significantly among groups A1, A3, and A5. However, the vertical forces on the second premolars reversed from intrusion in group A1 to extrusion in groups A3 and A5. Conclusions With clear aligners, the “bowing effect” is seen during en-masse anterior teeth retraction and can be partially relieved by performing en-masse retraction accompanied by anterior teeth intrusion. Vertical control of incisors remained unsolved during en-masse retraction, even when intrusive activation was added to the anterior teeth.","","","","62c8f851b00c6dcbec025a69c5d0454168541f39","","","","","","Force changes associated with differential activation of en-masse retraction and/or intrusion with clear aligners","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62c8f851b00c6dcbec025a69c5d0454168541f39","","2020"

To investigate the relationships among different intrusion patterns of clear overlay aligners and the corresponding orthodontic forces and to provide guidance for clinical treatment.


MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Five sets of removable thermoplastic-formed aligners with the same thickness, designed for different intrusion procedures (G0 aligners as a control group, with no activation; G1 aligners for intruding canines; G2 aligners for intruding incisors; G3 aligners for intruding canines and incisors with the same activations; G4 aligners for intruding canines and incisors with different activation), were manufactured, and the corresponding intrusion forces were measured with a multiaxis force/torque transducer measurement system in real time.


RESULTS:
With the same activation (0.2-mm intrusion) and rectangular attachments placed on the premolars and first molars, the canines experienced the largest intrusive force when intruded alone using G1 aligners. The canines received a larger intrusive force than incisors in G3. The incisors received similar forces in G2 and G3. First premolars endured the largest extrusive forces when all anterior teeth were intruded with G3 aligners. Extrusion forces were exerted on canines and lateral incisors when using G4 aligners.


CONCLUSIONS:
Aligners with different intrusion patterns exert different forces on incisors, canines, and premolars, and the forces were closely related to the designed activation, shape and position of the attachment and relative movement of the adjacent teeth.","","","","cc9f15f806ca6a85c2f7bcf3c0c6e7655ae2d0ae","","","","","","Force changes associated with different intrusion strategies for deep-bite correction by clear aligners.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc9f15f806ca6a85c2f7bcf3c0c6e7655ae2d0ae","","2018"

Transverse correction and controlled upper and lower incisors proclination completed the treatment plan. Results: Full deep bite correction with normal overbite was obtained in nine months of treatment by a combination of anterior intrusion and posterior torque correction, distal tipping and relative extrusion.

The orthodontic force on the upper right incisor was measured every 24 h for two weeks using a custom-made measuring device. The force of the Eucommia elastomer (4.25 ± 0.274 N) and multi bracket system (5.32 ± 0.338 N) did not change from the beginning to the end (p > 0.01). The orthodontic force exerted by the Eucommia elastomer was lower than that of the multi-bracket orthodontic appliance from the beginning to the end. The force of Erkodur significantly decreased from the beginning to 24 h (6.47 ± 1.40 N) and 48 h (3.30 ± 0.536 N) (p < 0.01). The force of Essix C+® significantly decreased from the beginning (13.2 ± 0.845 N) to 24 h (8.77 ± 0.231 N) (p < 0.01). The thermoplastic orthodontic appliance made of Eucommia elastomer continuously exerted a constant orthodontic force for two weeks under water immersion conditions. The orthodontic force of Eucommia elastomer was found to be similar to the orthodontic force exerted by the multi-bracket orthodontic appliance with 0.019 × 0.025 in nickel–titanium wire.

Simultaneously, aesthetic orthodontic treatment with removable clear aligners has become commonly requested. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the management of facilitated aesthetic orthodontic treatment, a combined approach including piezocision corticotomy and clear aligners for orthodontic treatment. Orthodontic planning for traditional clear aligners should be modified to take advantage of the corticotomy technique in order to facilitate the most difficult orthodontic movements needed to achieve treatment completion, where each aligner will be used for four days rather than 15 days for a total time of four months. A corticotomy with a modified minimally invasive flapless piezocision technique should be performed in both jaws at the same time, before the time window of the orthodontic treatment, where the most difficult orthodontic movements are planned. Treatment planning where difficult orthodontic movements, such as anterior open-bite closure and extraction space closure, are easily managed with clear aligners and are presented as examples of facilitated aesthetic orthodontic treatment application. The combination between aesthetic treatment with clear aligners and modified piezocision corticotomy, if carefully planned, seems to represent a synergy that achieves the current goals of orthodontic treatment.

This “bite-block effect” is primarily anecdotal due to the frequent occurrence of posterior open bites in patients after clear aligner therapy. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare changes promoted by clear aligners and traditional fixed appliances in cephalometric measurements of the vertical dimension and molar position in adult patients with Class I malocclusion treated with non-extraction. Methods: Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of adult patients treated with either clear aligners (n=44) or traditional fixed appliances (n=22) were selected for retrospective analysis. Eight interval measurements and one nominal measurement were evaluated: anterior overbite (OB), mandibular plane angle related to cranial base (SN_MP) and related to Frankfort (FMA), lower molar height (L6H) and upper molar height (U6H), palatal plane to mandibular plane angle (PP_MP), lower facial height (LFH), total facial height (TFH), and posterior open bite (Posterior_OB). A single evaluator traced all cephalographs, and changes in select measures of the vertical dimension were compared within and between groups. Results: OB decreased (1.15 mm) and L6H increased (0.63 mm) in the traditional fixed appliance group. Mandibular plane angles (related to cranial base and to Frankfort) increased (0.43° and 0.53°, respectively) in the clear aligner group, but just FMA showed significant difference between groups (difference of 0.53°). LFH and TFH increased (ranging from 0.52 mm to 0.80 mm) in both groups, with no differences between treatment modality. Presence of visible posterior open bite significantly increased over the course of treatment. OB, FMA and L6H exhibited an interaction between treatment stage (pre- and post-treatment) and modality (clear aligner therapy and traditional fixed appliances), but no interaction among these three variables was found. Conclusions: The evidence does not support the theory that clear aligner therapy produces better vertical dimension control than traditional fixed appliances. Traditional fixed appliance therapy slightly extruded the lower molar, and clear aligner therapy produced a slightly mandibular backward rotation.","","","","f088e6a74ac9e32d172ce6bfa993bbbb73a1e555","","","","","","Cephalometric evaluation of changes in vertical dimension and molar position in adult non-extraction treatment with clear aligners and traditional fixed appliances","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f088e6a74ac9e32d172ce6bfa993bbbb73a1e555","","2021"

To assess the efficacy and efficiency of treatment in adolescents presenting with mild malocclusions, comparing outcomes using clear aligners to fixed appliances.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients identified retrospectively and consecutively from one private practice had been treated with either clear aligners (Invisalign, Align Technology, Santa Clara, Calif) or fixed appliances (0.022 Damon, Ormco, Orange, Calif; n = 26/group). Assessments of occlusion were made using the American Board of Orthodontics Discrepancy Index (DI) for initial records and Cast-Radiograph Evaluation (CRE) for final records. Number of appointments, number of emergency visits, and overall treatment time were determined from chart reviews. Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation, Wilcoxon rank tests, unpaired t-tests, and Chi-square tests, with significance set to P ≤ .05.


RESULTS
Pretreatment, the aligner and fixed groups showed no significant difference in overall severity (DI: 11.9 ± 5.3 vs 11.6 ± 4.8) or in any individual DI category. Posttreatment scores showed finishes for the aligner group had fewer discrepancies from ideal relative to the fixed appliance group (CRE: 30.1 ± 8.3 vs 37.0 ± 9.3; P < .01). Patients treated with aligners had fewer appointments (13.7 ± 4.4 vs 19.3 ± 3.6; P < .0001), fewer emergency visits (0.8 ± 1.0 vs 3.6 ± 2.5; P < .0001), and shorter overall treatment time (16.9 ± 5.7 vs 23.4 ± 4.4 months; P < .0001).


CONCLUSIONS
Outcomes for treatment of mild malocclusions in adolescents showed equivalent effectiveness of clear aligners compared to fixed appliances, with significantly improved results for clear aligner treatment in terms of tooth alignment, occlusal relations, and overjet. Assessment of the number of appointments, number of emergency visits, and overall treatment time showed better outcomes for treatment with clear aligners.","","","","11eaa16fe5d73ec63bdb2d3bb132dfe622c88cd3","","","","","","Outcome assessment of orthodontic clear aligner vs fixed appliance treatment in a teenage population with mild malocclusions.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11eaa16fe5d73ec63bdb2d3bb132dfe622c88cd3","","2020"

"944",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Objective
The objective of this clinical study was to assess the predicted software models and clinical models and to compare the stage models of both the groups so as to evaluate the efficacy of tooth movement with clear aligner.


Methods
The sample size included 10 cases with mild anterior crowding treated with aligner therapy. The predicted software models were superimposed on the clinical stereolithography (STL) models at various stages by using the MeshLab software. The predicted software models showing orthodontic tooth movement were compared with the actual movement achieved clinically.


Results
The results of the present study have shown that when a comparison was made on the basis of irregularity scores in both the groups, it was seen that the irregularity score was higher at 2.55 at T4, 1.65 at T6, and 1.0 at T8 in the clinical STL group at each stage, whereas it was 2.0 at T4, 0.90 at T6, and 0.25 at T8 in the software model group. In addition, in comparing the mean accuracy of these three stages, the analysis of data showed that the mean accuracy is 62.5% at T4, 68.8% at T6, and 78.1% at T8.


Conclusion
The predicted software models do not accurately reflect the patient's tooth position. There is an overestimation by predicted software as compared with actual clinically achieved tooth position. There is a need of overcorrection to be built in the treatment planning stage itself and execution of the anticipated end result.","","","","a707c7981c1f090684d65c1a0037594c7a61c29d","","","","","","Comparative Assessment of Clinical and Predicted Treatment Outcomes of Clear Aligner Treatment: An in Vivo Study.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a707c7981c1f090684d65c1a0037594c7a61c29d","","2019"

"946",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of a copper–calcium–hydroxide-based compound to remove microbial plaque naturally produced onto orthodontic clear aligners. A commercially available dental paste, named Cupral, based on copper–calcium–hydroxide, was used. A healthy volunteer (female, 32 years old), undergoing orthodontic treatment with thermoplastic clear aligners was enrolled. By conventional/confocal microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, 2-week used aligners were examined for microbial plaque, prior and following exposure to Cupral. Confocal microscopy revealed abundant plaque irregularly distributed onto the aligner surface. Following Cupral treatment, a drastic decrease occurred in plaque thickness and matrix presence. As assessed by the CFU assay, total microbial load approached 109 CFUs/aligner, with slight differences in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis culture conditions; six macroscopically different types of colonies were detected and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Following Cupral treatment, microbial load dropped to undetectable levels, irrespectively of the conditions considered. Exposure of clear aligners to Cupral results in the elimination of contaminating microorganisms; the antimicrobial activity is retained up to 1.25% concentration. Overall, our data describe a novel use of Cupral, a copper–calcium–hydroxide-based compound, in daily hygiene practices with promising results.","","","","4e596bc1c8f542ce7736bff4cdaadc1bd19a926f","","","","","","Efficacy of a Copper–Calcium–Hydroxide Solution in Reducing Microbial Plaque on Orthodontic Clear Aligners: A Case Report","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e596bc1c8f542ce7736bff4cdaadc1bd19a926f","","2019"

"949",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Objective The upper incisors torque expression is essential for the orthodontic treatment accuracy. Various orthodontic devices are claimed to have different inclination control capacity. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the radiographic buccolingual inclination of upper incisors in patients treated with three different orthodontic techniques. Material and Methods Conventional brackets (Victory, 3M), self-ligating appliances (Damon Q, Ormco), and aligners (Invisalign, Align Technology) were tested. Cephalometric data of 25 patients with similar skeletal and dental pretreatment parameters were collected for each technique. Position changes of upper central incisors were assessed with radiographic evaluation before and after therapy. Three different parameters were considered: 11∧SnaSnp, 11∧Ocl and I+ TVL. All variables were measured before (T0) and after (T1) treatment and their variation over treatment was assessed. Results When evaluating angular measurements, 11∧SnaSnp and 11∧Ocl angles showed the highest numeric variation with conventional brackets. Lowest values were reported with aligners. However, the differences among various techniques were not significant for both angles (P>0.05). Also I+ TVL linear value variation did not show significant differences among the different groups tested (P>0.05). Conclusion Conventional multibrackets appliance showed the highest incisal position variations over treatment, but the differences among various groups were not significantly different.","","","","42e6328a5fd5691ad94484e732c9db995fbd14d5","","","","","","Buccolingual Inclination Control of Upper Central Incisors of Aligners: A Comparison with Conventional and Self-Ligating Brackets","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42e6328a5fd5691ad94484e732c9db995fbd14d5","","2018"

Forty patterns of aligners were randomly selected: 20 LD30 and 20 EX30, worn intra-orally for 14±3 days, 22 h/day. From each aligner, 10 specimens were prepared from buccal surfaces of the incisor region by the cutting of samples 5×5 mm under a stereomicroscope. All samples were subjected to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, tensile and indentation strength test. LD30 appeared more homogeneous, with a crystalline fraction lower than EX30 and exhibited a higher elastic behavior and a lower tendency to warp after use than EX30. LD30 demonstrated better adaptability to the dental arch and greater consistency of application of orthodontic forces than produced with EX30.

"951",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Objective The aim of this systematic multiscale analysis was to evaluate the effects of thermoforming on the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used to fabricate transparent orthodontic aligners (TOAs). Methods Specimens were fabricated using four types of thermoplastic materials with different thicknesses under a thermal vacuum. Transparency, water absorption and solubility, surface hardness, and the results of three-point bending and tensile tests were evaluated before and after thermoforming. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test. Results After thermoforming, the transparency of Duran and Essix A+ decreased, while the water absorption ability of all materials; the water solubility of Duran, Essix A+, and Essix ACE; and the surface hardness of Duran and Essix A+ increased. The flexure modulus for the 0.5-mm-thick Duran, Essix A+, and eCligner specimens increased, whereas that for the 0.75-/1.0-mm-thick Duran and eClginer specimens decreased. In addition, the elastic modulus increased for the 0.5-mm-thick Essix A+ specimens and decreased for the 0.75-mm-thick Duran and Essix ACE and the 1.0-mm-thick Essix ACE specimens. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used for the fabrication of TOAs should be evaluated after thermoforming in order to characterize their properties for clinical application.","","","","41bb431139cb8ece8ed3ad71195222d1dae7a2bf","","","","","","Effects of thermoforming on the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials for transparent orthodontic aligners","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41bb431139cb8ece8ed3ad71195222d1dae7a2bf","","2018"

"953",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the orthodontic literature with regard to efficiency, effectiveness and stability of treatment outcome with clear aligners compared with treatment with conventional brackets.


METHODS
An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in October 2014 in the following electronic databases: Google Scholar, the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, Scopus, CENTRAL, MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID and Web of Science. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Quality assessment of the included articles was performed. Two authors were responsible for study selection, validity assessment and data extraction.


RESULTS
Four controlled clinical trials including a total of 252 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. We grouped the trials into four main comparisons. One randomized controlled trial was classified as level 1B evidence, and three cohort studies were classified as level 2B evidence. Clear aligners appear to have a significant advantage with regard to chair time and treatment duration in mild-to-moderate cases based on several cross-sectional studies. No other differences in stability and occlusal characteristics after treatment were found between the two systems.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite claims about the effectiveness of clear aligners, evidence is generally lacking. Shortened treatment duration and chair time in mild-to-moderate cases appear to be the only significant effectiveness of clear aligners over conventional systems that are supported by the current evidence.","","","","49c7c4a91e7b7db97b73e51720e702c214a18d51","","","","","","Efficiency, effectiveness and treatment stability of clear aligners: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49c7c4a91e7b7db97b73e51720e702c214a18d51","","2017"

By combining the methods of computer vision, 3D imaging, and new modeling techniques, new, increased health prevention, aesthetic, and comfortability expectations can be fulfilled together with the requirements of sustainable health promotion and restoration of functional integrity with a decreased burden of harmful radiation load and invasive interventions. In this paper, a new 3D model based designing technique is introduced by which the 3D movements of the teeth (including the roots) can be designed, followed, and kept under control during the whole rehabilitation process. The follow-up of the implementation of the orthodontic treatment planning is important not only when determining the location of the tooth crown but because it enables to carry out the radiation-free monitoring of the planned treatments precisely mapped based on the anatomic aptitudes. This results in the continuous determination of the positions of roots and of their correlation with each other which is an essential condition in regards to the stability of the treatment outcome.","","","","3ea9d7788bb22df3e4b0e2f7f415404b53f7b388","","","","","","Fuzzy logic supported 3D modeling based orthodontics","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ea9d7788bb22df3e4b0e2f7f415404b53f7b388","","2017"

"957",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","OBJECTIVE
To describe an orthodontic treatment that combines an esthetic approach (clear aligners) with surgery (alveolar corticotomy).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A patient with moderate dental crowding and Class I skeletal and molar relationships was selected. Orthodontic records of the patient were taken. Periodontal indexes, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), and treatment time were evaluated. After we reflected a full-thickness flap beyond the teeth apices, the cortical bone was exposed on the buccal aspect and a modified corticotomy procedure was performed. Interproximal corticotomy cuts were extended through the entire thickness of the cortical layer, just barely penetrating into medullary bone. Orthodontic force was applied on the teeth immediately after surgery.


RESULTS
Total treatment time was 2 months. Periodontal indexes were improved after correction of crowding. A deterioration of OHRQoL was limited to 3 days following surgery.


CONCLUSION
This case report may encourage the use, limited to selected cases, of corticotomy associated with clear aligners to treat moderate crowding.","","","","d3f7d7899686bfe4e86181ab1ac3b94f37a49779","","","","","","The combined use of corticotomy and clear aligners: A case report.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3f7d7899686bfe4e86181ab1ac3b94f37a49779","","2016"
"958",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The approach to skeletal dysmorphisms in the maxillofacial area usually requires an orthodontic treatment by means of fixed appliances, both before and after the surgical phase. Since its introduction, Invisalign system has become a popular treatment choice for the clinicians because of the aesthetics and comfort of the removable clear aligners compared with the traditional appliances. Therefore, the aim of the present report was to illustrate the management of a malocclusion by means of Invisalign system associated with the traditional surgical technique. The present paper shows a case of a 23-year-old male patient characterized by a Class III malocclusion with lateral deviation of the mandible to the left side and cross-bite on teeth 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. Invisalign system was used during the pre- and postsurgical phases rather than fixed appliances. The posttreatment cephalometric analysis emphasized the stability of the dental and skeletal symmetry corrections, occlusion and functional balance, over a 6-year follow-up. The results achieved at the end of the treatment showed how Invisalign can be effective in the management of the orthodontic phases in orthognathic surgery. The follow-up after 6 years emphasizes the stability of the treatment over time.","","","","e06bee6928ffd29a1974d1c236d92366ef91ae6d","","","","","","The Use of Invisalign® System in the Management of the Orthodontic Treatment before and after Class III Surgical Approach","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e06bee6928ffd29a1974d1c236d92366ef91ae6d","","2016"

The aim of this study was to assess treatment outcomes of the Invisalign and compare results with braces.


METHODS
One hundred and fifty-two adult orthodontic patients, referred to two Orthodontic Specialist Clinics, were randomized to receive either invisalign or brace treatment. All patients were evaluated by using methods from the American Board of Orthodontics Phase III examination. The discrepancy index was used to analyze pretreatment records to control for initial severity of malocclusion. The objective grading system was used to systematically grade posttreatment records. The Wilcoxon 2-sample tests were used to evaluate treatment outcome of Invisalign and braces.


RESULTS
The total mean scores of the objective grading system categories were improved after treatment in both groups. The improvements were not statistically significant in scores for alignment, marginal ridges, occlusal relations, over jet, inter-proximal contacts, and root angulation. Invisalign scores were consistently lower than braces scores for buccolingual inclination and occlusal contacts.


CONCLUSIONS
The overall improvement in OGS scores indicate that both Invisalign and fixed appliances were successful in treating Class I adult extraction cases in this sample.","","","","1f11e3f987715f4a65a172e55a6f2fc72d1b13c7","","","","","","The effectiveness of the Invisalign appliance in extraction cases using the the ABO model grading system: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f11e3f987715f4a65a172e55a6f2fc72d1b13c7","","2015"

"967",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Three aspects have had a significant impact on orthodontics during the last few decades: the appliances being used, the anchorage being used and finally the distribution of patients being treated. Firstly, the marketing of appliances is increasingly leading the orthodontist to outsource important aspects of treatment such as wirebending and bracket positioning. Brackets and wires are being presented as the solution to all problems and metaphysical terms such as ‘intelligent design,’ ‘working brackets’ and ‘intelligent wires’ are dominating advertising and reducing the impact of evidence-based treatment approaches. Secondly, the introduction of skeletal anchorage has potentially widened the spectrum of orthodontics, allowing for treatments that could not be done with conventional appliances. Biomechanical knowledge is, however, mandatory if we agree that the system should not be abused. Thirdly, the orthodontic population comprises an increasing number of adult patients, many of whom are characterized by a degenerated dentition. The treatment of these patients requires a thorough knowledge not only of biomechanics but also of the reaction of the periodontal tissues to various types of loading. They can be treated only with custom-made appliances adapting the force systems and magnitude to the patient-specific treatment goal. In summary, the orthodontic world is being split between ‘appliance-driven fast-food orthodontics’ where the results to a large extent are dependent on both growth and function and ‘orthodontist-driven’ ‘slow-food’ treatments attempting to push the limits of the possible in relation to complicated problems and reversal of degeneration in adult patients. The latter treatments are performed with individualized appliances adapting the force system to the patient. This paper will attempt to summarize the bearing of these factors on present orthodontics.","","","","704020e85faa89d84a78a41c03884bd4e0f785f9","","","","","","Northcroft Lecture: How has the Spectrum of Orthodontics Changed over the past Decades?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/704020e85faa89d84a78a41c03884bd4e0f785f9","","2011"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the transverse dimension and the perimeter of the maxillary arch produced by low friction self-ligating brackets TIME 3 compared to the Invisalign technique.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Both the self-ligating sample and the Invisalign group were composed of 20 subjects, evaluated at the beginning (T0) and at the completion of therapy (T1). All subjects presented a Class I malocclusion with mild crowding in a permanent dentition, without craniofacial anomalies, missing teeth or a history of orthodontic treatment. Dento-alveolar measurements were made on the maxillary dental casts at T0 and T1. Significant differences between the treated groups were assessed with Independent Samples t test (p<0.05).


RESULTS
Statistically significant differences between self-ligating sample and Invisalign group were recorded for CWC, FPWF, FPWL, SPWF, SPWL, and AP measurements. No significant changes were found for CWL, MWF, MWL, and AD values. There was not a statistically significant difference between the treatment durations of the groups: 1.8 years for both patients. These data suggest that Invisalign treatment cannot be somewhat faster than fixed appliances. Moreover the final occlusion might not be as ideal.

The low fiction self-ligating system produced statistically significant different outcomes in the transverse dento-alveolar width and the perimeter of the maxillary arch during treatment when compared to Invisalign tecnique.","","","","aed51ba33da974b2a36c366f8bb5566f340cdaef","","","","","","Self-ligating versus Invisalign: analysis of dento-alveolar effects.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aed51ba33da974b2a36c366f8bb5566f340cdaef","","2011"

This pilot study was performed to test the hypothesis that an orthodontic oral appliance (OA) that is designed to work against the backwardly directed forces on the upper incisors may counteract the reduction in overjet from these devices.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty patients with normal bites, good oral health, and milder sleep apnea were randomized to treatment with either OAs or orthodontic OAs. Bite changes were evaluated on plaster casts and radiographs and by questionnaires after a mean of 2.4 years in 19 frequent users.


RESULTS
Four of nine patients in the orthodontic OA group increased their overjet by > or =0.4 mm, while none of the 10 patients in the OA group experienced that effect.


CONCLUSION
Only the orthodontic OA increases the overjet; this design may therefore be beneficial to patients at risk of negative effects on their bite during OA treatment.","","","","9359216c5e6a5725596e9bd82f17f20a7a9c9b3d","","","","","","An orthodontic oral appliance.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9359216c5e6a5725596e9bd82f17f20a7a9c9b3d","","2010"

"975",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","In this report, three patients were treated with a new treatment protocol for Invisalign to demonstrate that a variety of complex malocclusions can be successfully treated using this protocol, including correction of moderate crowding, correction of moderate Class II division 1, and deep overbite. Previous studies of Invisalign showed significant limitations for more complex orthodontic treatment, although a few recent case reports have shown successfully completed moderate to difficult orthodontic malocclusions. One reason for the discrepancy is that the earlier studies were done during the first four years of the appliance development (now ten years of clinical use), when significant problems existed with accomplishing bodily movement, torquing of roots, extrusions, and rotations of premolars and canines. The new protocol included new methods for anterior/posterior corrections, showing on the computer the effect of elastics for Class II treatment simulated as a one-stage anterior/posterior movement at the end of treatment. Staging for interproximal reduction (IPR) is now automatically staged when there is better access to interproximal contacts to avoid IPR where significant overlap between teeth is present to avoid performing IPR on surfaces that may be damaged by instruments such as burs, strips, and disks when cut on a sharp angle. Staging for tooth movements is now also done to enable combination movements to occur simultaneously for each tooth with the tooth that needs to move the most (the lead tooth) determining the minimum number of stages required. All other teeth move at a slower rate than the lead tooth throughout the duration of treatment. Attachments are now placed in the middle of the crown automatically for rotation and automatically sized in proportion to the clinical crown. Use of 1 mm thick (buccal-lingual dimension) horizontal beveled rectangular attachments is standard on premolars for retention of aligners during intrusive movements, such as leveling the lower curve of Spee in deep overbite for extrusions and for control of the tooth long axis during torquing movements. Staging of tooth movements now track linear and rotational velocities of teeth separately with the number of treatment stages determined by the lead tooth based on its rotational or linear maximum velocities at no more than two degrees of rotation per stage. Simultaneous movements are done for all teeth providing visible space (approximately 0.05 mm) between teeth during movements past other teeth using expansion instead of IPR as a primary way to increase space available for correction of crowding.","","","","af58dc4055527be0437c29d28832e1b43ffcbc9b","","","","","","Esthetic orthodontic treatment using the invisalign appliance for moderate to complex malocclusions.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af58dc4055527be0437c29d28832e1b43ffcbc9b","","2008"

The literature is becoming replete with systematic reviews of orthodontic-related topics. However, their findings have not been appraised and summarised collectively.


METHODS
Systematic reviews related to orthodontics published between 1 January 2000, and 31 January 2007 were identified and reviewed.


RESULTS
Fifty-one orthodontic systematic reviews were identified in the defined period. A highly significant percentage of reviews (29%) failed to reach conclusions. Conclusions were made in the remaining reviews although many relied on secondary levels of evidence to do so. In this narrative review the findings from these studies are summarised.


CONCLUSIONS
Systematic reviews in orthodontic-related areas have produced some interesting findings. However an unacceptably high number continue to be inconclusive, reflecting methodological inadequacies of the review process and exposing inadequacies in our evidence base.","","","","fa2786b34119ae650ddfbcc698ce0a7fb4c6751f","","","","","","Systematic reviews in orthodontics: what have we learned?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa2786b34119ae650ddfbcc698ce0a7fb4c6751f","","2008"

To compare the postretention dental changes between patients treated with Invisalign and those treated with conventional fixed appliances.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a comparative cohort study using patient records of one orthodontist in New York City. Two groups of patients were identified that differed only in the method of treatment (Invisalign and Braces group). Dental casts and panoramic radiographs were collected and analyzed using the objective grading system (OGS) of the American Board of Orthodontics (ABO). The cases were evaluated immediately after appliance removal (T1) and at a postretention time (T2), three years after appliance removal. All patients had completed active orthodontic treatment and had undergone at least one year of retention. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate differences in treatment outcomes between the groups for each of the eight categories in the OGS, including four additional subcategories in the alignment category. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine the significance of changes within each group from T1 to T2.


RESULTS
The change in the total alignment score in the Invisalign group was significantly larger than that for the Braces group. There were significant changes in total alignment and mandibular anterior alignment in both groups. There were significant changes in maxillary anterior alignment in the Invisalign group only.


CONCLUSIONS
In this sample for this period of observation, patients treated with Invisalign relapsed more than those treated with conventional fixed appliances.","","","","40ff2050cdaa66359f9f6b10665a4f7727ab697f","","","","","","Invisalign and traditional orthodontic treatment postretention outcomes compared using the American Board of Orthodontics objective grading system.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40ff2050cdaa66359f9f6b10665a4f7727ab697f","","2007"
"979",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","BACKGROUND
Most current paper- and computer-based formats for patient documentation use a two-dimensional dental chart, a design that originated almost 150 years ago in the United States. No studies have investigated the inclusion of a three-dimensional (3-D) charting interface in a general dental record.


METHODS
A multidisciplinary research team with expertise in human-computer interaction, dental informatics and computer science conducted a 14-week project to develop and evaluate a proof of concept for a 3-D dental record. Through several iterations of paper- and computer-based prototypes, the project produced a high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype that was evaluated by two dentists and two dental students.


RESULTS
The project implemented a prototypical patient record built around a 3-D model of a patient's maxillofacial structures. Novel features include automatic retrieval of images and radiographs; a flexible view of teeth, soft tissue and bone; access to historical patient data through a timeline; and the ability to focus on a single tooth.


CONCLUSIONS
Users tests demonstrated acceptance for the basic design of the prototype, but also identified several challenges in developing intuitive, easy-to-use navigation methods and hi-fi representations in a 3-D record.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Test participants in this project accepted the preliminary design of a 3-D dental record. Significant further research must be conducted before the concept can be applied and evaluated in clinical practice.","","","","81d3c5541e3c9cb341955bc49cf97e9824a3370f","","","","","","The feasibility of a three-dimensional charting interface for general dentistry.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81d3c5541e3c9cb341955bc49cf97e9824a3370f","","2007"
"980",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Advances in all aspects of science and discovery continue to occur at an exponential rate, leading to a wealth of new knowledge and technologies that have the potential to transform dental practice. This ""new science"" within the areas of cell/ molecular biology, genetics, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and informatics has been available for several years; however, the assimilation of this information into the dental curriculum has been slow. For the profession and the patients it serves to benefit fully from modern science, new knowledge and technologies must be incorporated into the mainstream of dental education. The continued evolution of the dental curriculum presents a major challenge to faculty, administrators, and external constituencies because of the high cost, overcrowded schedule, unique demands of clinical training, changing nature of teaching/assessment methods, and large scope of new material impacting all areas of the educational program. Additionally, there is a lack of personnel with adequate training/experience in both foundational and clinical sciences to support the effective application and/or integration of new science information into curriculum planning, implementation, and assessment processes. Nonetheless, the speed of this evolution must be increased if dentistry is to maintain its standing as a respected health care profession. The influence of new science on dental education and the dental curriculum is already evident in some dental schools. For example, the Marquette University School of Dentistry has developed a comprehensive model of curriculum revision that integrates foundational and clinical sciences and also provides a dedicated research/scholarly track and faculty development programming to support such a curriculum. Educational reforms at other dental schools are based on addition of new curricular elements and include innovative approaches that introduce concepts regarding new advances in science, evidence-based foundations, and translational research. To illustrate these reforms, the Marquette curriculum and initiatives at the University of Connecticut and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio dental schools are described in this article, with recognition that other dental schools may also be developing strategies to infuse new science and evidence-based critical appraisal skills into their students' educational experiences. Discussion of the rationale, goals/objectives, and outcomes within the context of dissemination of these models should help other dental schools to design approaches for integrating this new material that are appropriate to their particular circumstances and mission. For the profession to advance, every dental school must play a role in establishing a culture that attaches value to research/discovery, evidence-based practice, and the application of new knowledge/technologies to patient care.","","","","6df90b0348cd5d9fbf0e8a163d6e04f12490c257","","","","","","The influence of ""new science"" on dental education: current concepts, trends, and models for the future.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6df90b0348cd5d9fbf0e8a163d6e04f12490c257","","2007"

There is a high prevalence of gastro-duodenal disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Peptic ulcer disease in dyspeptic patients, 24.5%, was comparable to prevalence of gastro-duodenal disease among symptomatic individuals in developed countries (12 - 25%). Limited data exists regarding its associated risk factors despite accumulating evidence indicating that gastroduodenal disease is common in Ghana.


OBJECTIVES
This study investigates risk factors associated with gastro-duodenal disease at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana.


METHODS
This study utilized a cross-sectional design to consecutively recruit patients referred with upper gastro-intestinal symptoms for endoscopy. The study questionnaire was administered to study participants. Helicobacter pylori infection was confirmed by rapid-urease examination at endoscopy.


RESULTS
Of 242 patients sampled; 64 had duodenal ulcer, 66 gastric ulcer, 27gastric cancer and 64 non-ulcer dyspepsia. Nineteen (19) had duodenal and gastric ulcer while 2 had gastric ulcer and cancer. A third (32.6%) of patients had history of NSAID-use. H. pyloriwas associated with gastric ulcer (p=0.033) and duodenal ulcer (p=0.001). There was an increased prevalence of duodenal ulcer in H. pylori-infected patients taking NSAIDs, P=0.003.


CONCLUSION
H. pylori was a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease. However, NSAID-related gastro-duodenal injury has been shown to be common in H. pylori infected patients. It highlights the need for awareness of the adverse gastro-intestinal effects in a H. pylori endemic area.","","","","959dc7684f7e0f4421e9caee65f41a901380f464","","","","","","Factors associated with gastro-duodenal disease in patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/959dc7684f7e0f4421e9caee65f41a901380f464","","2016"
"985",":Paper","CC-BY","Objective To present results of the Kyoto Global Consensus Meeting, which was convened to develop global consensus on (1) classification of chronic gastritis and duodenitis, (2) clinical distinction of dyspepsia caused by Helicobacter pylori from functional dyspepsia, (3) appropriate diagnostic assessment of gastritis and (4) when, whom and how to treat H. pylori gastritis. Design Twenty-three clinical questions addressing the above-mentioned four domains were drafted for which expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements. A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as ≥80%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto. Results All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions after extensive modifications and omission of one clinical question were achieved with a consensus level of >80%. To better organise classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on aetiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia together with a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimise the risk of more serious complications of the infection. Conclusions A global consensus for gastritis was developed for the first time, which will be the basis for an international classification system and for further research on the subject.","","","","40d8add5cb9fc1d48b61bf721d8a7596ce2f1498","","","","","","Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40d8add5cb9fc1d48b61bf721d8a7596ce2f1498","","2015"
"986",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a heterogeneous disorder associated with diverse pathophysiological mechanisms, including immune activation and low-grade mucosal inflammation. Genetic factors, physiological functions, and environmental factors may determine the relative importance of various pathophysiological mechanisms. This study was designed to determine the histological alterations in the duodenal mucosa of Nigerian patients with FD. Methods Consecutive patients with dyspepsia seen over a 27-month period in two gastrointestinal endoscopy facilities in Enugu, South-East Nigeria were further evaluated with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal mucosal biopsies if no lesion was found in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with heartburn and/or regurgitation who did not have any dyspeptic symptoms and did not have any lesion in the upper gastrointestinal tract on endoscopy were presumed to have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and they served as controls. The control subjects also had duodenal biopsies. The histopathological findings in the cases and controls were compared. Results There were 68 patients with FD and 52 patients with NERD. The total inflammatory score was 242 in FD and 66 in NERD (Mann-Whitney U =1168, P=0.0011). Similarly, the scores for chronic inflammation, gastric metaplasia, neutrophilic activity, eosinophilic infiltration, and Helicobacter pylori were significantly higher in FD than NERD. Conclusion Functional dyspepsia is associated with a high degree of inflammation in the duodenal mucosa. This may reflect the high prevalence of gastrointestinal infections in a tropical environment such as Nigeria. These findings may have therapeutic potential that further studies might elucidate.","","","","ca5ee83cd41747250f01c4010313423ec1c78342","","","","","","High degree of duodenal inflammation in Nigerians with functional dyspepsia","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca5ee83cd41747250f01c4010313423ec1c78342","","2013"

"989",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Objectives: The objective of the study was to ascertain the appropriateness of indications for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy in children with dyspepsia. Methods: We used the RAND/University of California at Los Angeles method to investigate the appropriateness of the opinions of a panel of experts. The panel judged 2304 theoretical patient scenarios defined by a combination of demographic and clinical variables. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: The panel rated UGI endoscopy as appropriate in 27.2% of cases, inappropriate in 14.3%, and dubious in 58.5%. Disagreement emerged for 21% of cases. UGI endoscopy was considered increasingly appropriate in cases with a positive family history of peptic ulcer and/or Helicobacter pylori infection (odds ratio [OR] 8.518, P < 0.0001), when dyspepsia interfered with activities of daily living (“sleep” OR 7.540, P < 0.0001; “normal activities” OR 5.725, P < 0.0001), and when patients were older than 10 years (“≤10 years” OR 0.310, P < 0.0001) the longer the duration (“0–2 months” OR 0.002, P < 0.0001; “3–5 months” OR 0.059, P < 0.0001; “6–11 months” OR 0.516, P = 0.0005) and the greater the severity (“mild” OR 0.002, P < 0.0001; “moderate” OR 0.013, P < 0.0001) of their dyspeptic symptoms.

"990",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and recurrent abdominal pain in children is still controversial. H. pylori-infected children with recurrent abdominal pain generally do not require treatment. However, benefit of treatment has been known to produce dramatic improvements in some patients. Furthermore, H. pylori-infected is associated with growth retardation, iron deficiency anemia and thrombocytopenia. The objective of this study was to find suggestive parameters for eradication of H. pylori gastritis. From 1992 to 2004, medical records of 42 children diagnosed as having H. pylori infection by endoscopy were retrospectively reviewed. Of those 42 patients, there were 36 patients with H. pylori gastritis without gastric or duodenal ulcer (85.7%), and 6 patients with ulcers (14.3%). Children with H. pylori gastritis were divided into 2 groups: responsive and unresponsive. Data including the duration of abdominal pain, endoscopic finding, histology, treatment, outcome and final diagnosis were collected. Additional data were obtained by telephone and letters. Of 36 patients, there were 24 and 12 patients in responsive and unresponsive groups, respectively. Three patients with anemia were all presented in the responsive group. Those experiencing abdominal pain less than 3 months more commonly belonged to the responsive group (P = 0.21). Marked erythema of gastric mucosa was only seen in the responsive group (P = 0.136). All cases of chronic moderate-active gastritis appeared in the responsive group (p = 0.03).

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of eradication therapy on the symptoms of Helicobacter pylori positive non-ulcer dyspepsia patients.


METHODS
Twenty-four patients participated in the study and the symptoms of daytime epigastric pain, night or hunger pain, nausea, vomiting, regurgitation, bloating, belching, early satiety and anorexia were scored at the beginning, the 15th day after starting eradication therapy (amoxicillin 2 gr bid, clarithromycin 2 gr bid and omeprazole 40 mg daily for two weeks) and during the third and sixth months. Gastric emptying of radiolabelled solid meal was determined at baseline and during the third month.


RESULTS
The Helicobacter pylori eradication rate was 79% and symptom scores significantly decreased during the follow-up period in both of the groups, irrespective of Helicobacter pylori status. The mean symptom scores of the 24 patients at baseline, day 15 and and months three and six were as follows: 1.275, 0.274, 0.496 and 0.238 respectively. Symptom scores for the 19 patients with Helicobacter pylori eradication were 1.084, 0.263, 0.347 and 0.215 respectively while in the five patients in whom Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy failed it was 2.0, 0.314, 1.06 and 0.32 respectively. Of the 16.6% Helicobacter pylori positive non-ulcer dyspepsia patients who had delayed gastric emptying of solids, there was no change after eradication therapy. Nine patients, including all of those in whom eradication therapy failed, required further medication (antacids/prokinetics) for continuing symptoms one month after completion of treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study suggest that Helicobacter pylori is a causal factor in symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia and that eradication therapy improves symptoms and endoscopic findings but has no effect on gastric emptying.","","","","fa59c0503eb02d5af745ecbbae937cecf13f4249","","","","","","The effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on symptoms and gastric emptying in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa59c0503eb02d5af745ecbbae937cecf13f4249","","2002"
"994",":Paper","CC-BY","Background and aims: A subset of non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) disorders can evolve into peptic ulcer disease. This prospective study attempted to determine the independent risk factors for ulcer formation in NUD patients, and compared the natural history of Helicobacter pylori positive and negative NUD subjects. Methods: From May 1997 to April 1999, consecutive NUD patients were enrolled into the study. Endoscopy was performed routinely on enrolment, at the end of the second and 12th months, and whenever there was a dyspepsia attack. Patients were prospectively followed up for two years. Results: Peptic ulcers occurred in 16 of 209 NUD patients during the two year follow up period. Multivariate analysis of 13 host and bacterial factors demonstrated that advanced age (odds ratio 2.90), H pylori infection (odds ratio 3.59), and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; odds ratio 4.46) were independently significant in predicting subsequent peptic ulcer development. NUD patients with all three risk factors had a 75% (3/4) risk of developing peptic ulcer but the ulcer incidence in patients without any of the risk parameters was only 1.2% (1/84). The resolution rate of symptoms in the H pylori positive NUD patients was similar to the H pylori negative patients (57.9% v 49.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) −5 to 22). However, rates for subsequent peptic ulcer and erosion development were significantly higher in H pylori positive patients than in H pylori negative patients (ulcer 12.6% v 3.5%, 95% CI 1–16; erosion 23.2% v 12.3%, 95% CI 1–21). Conclusion: A small but significant proportion of NUD patients develop peptic ulcer after long term follow up. H pylori infection, NSAID use, and advanced age are independent risk factors for subsequent ulcer formation. Follow up endoscopy is strongly indicated for an NUD patient with multiple risk factors for ulcer formation when symptoms recur.","","","","ac1f725f52b5d52ae62b6ec5ea443df351c9071d","","","","","","Risk factors for ulcer development in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia: a prospective two year follow up study of 209 patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac1f725f52b5d52ae62b6ec5ea443df351c9071d","","2002"
"995",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Goals To determine the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) compared with non-GERD controls. Study Two hundred subjects were identified from a list of Cedars-Sinai Medical Foundation patients and gastroenterology motility practice subjects with and without a potential diagnosis of GERD. All subjects were then evaluated independently by two blinded physicians who were asked to identify subjects with GERD based on taking a history (gold standard). A follow-up questionnaire was later mailed to patients. This questionnaire included Rome I criteria for IBS. The prevalence of IBS was compared between GERD and non-GERD subjects. Finally, to further strengthen the method, a retrospective review of all subjects' charts was conducted to identify patients who had had 24-hour pH tests, and the prevalence of IBS was determined in this subgroup. Results Of the 200 subjects, 90 (45%) patients returned the questionnaire. After excluding subjects with IBD and incomplete questionnaires, there were 84 subjects (35 with GERD) included in the analysis. Of the 35 GERD subjects, 25 (71%) were Rome I criteria positive for IBS, whereas only 17 of the 49 (35%) non-GERD subjects had IBS (odds ratio = 54.7, CI = 1.7–13.5, p < 0.01). In 11 of the GERD subjects a 24-hour pH study was available and confirmed GERD. Of these 11 subjects, 7 (64%) met Rome I criteria for IBS. Conclusion There is a higher prevalence of IBS in subjects with GERD compared with subjects without GERD.","","","","67ce91a08adc95ad9701915498300333cdb1d694","","","","","","Increased Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67ce91a08adc95ad9701915498300333cdb1d694","","2002"

"1000",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Dear Sir I read with great interest the article of Ciancarelli et al. (1) entitled ‘Helicobacter pylori infection and migraine’ and I fully agree with their conclusion that ‘in the absence of any specific link between H. pylori and migraine, the association, when present, must be considered as merely casual’. In a recent study (2, 3), a group of 31 children (median age 12 years) suffering from migraine with (n = 21) or without (n = 10) aura, who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society, underwent endoscopic oesophageal gastric and duodenal biopsy in order to determine whether the complaints were of gastrointestinal origin. Twenty-nine (93.5%) of the 31 children with migraine were found to have an underlying inflammatory lesion (e.g. duodenitis, gastritis, or oesophagitis, separately or combined), which would explain their complaints. Helicobacter pylori colonization was found in seven of the children: one had H. pylori-associated antral and corporal gastritis and six had H. pylori-associated antral gastritis only. Gastritis of the corpus without H. pylori was present in all six children. The data, which are consistent with those found in children with recurrent abdominal pain (4, 5), do not support the concept that H. pylori is a primary pathogen for the inflammatory changes seen in these children; nor do they establish an association between H. pylori antral gastritis and migraine. Our histological findings, however, which are similar to those found in children with recurrent abdominal pain (4, 5), strongly suggest that upper gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis not only of recurrent abdominal pain (5) but also of migraine. Further evidence to support this contention is provided by the data collected during our trial, which showed that ranitidine and tripotassium dicitratobismuthate, with or without antibiotics, were more effective than placebo in the management of children with migraine. How the inflammatory changes produce the attacks of migraine is unknown. The effect on mucosa nerve endings of tissue hormones (bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, substance P, leukotrienes, or prostaglandins) generated or released in the presence of inflammation, tissue necrosis, ischaemia and hypoxia is the main mechanism by which inflammation produces abdominal pain. Whether upper gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation seen in children studied could produce attacks of abdominal pain by means of this mechanism and subsequently migraine, possibly by the passage of minute amounts of the aforementioned vasoactive chemical substances into the blood stream (6), is an open question. In conclusion, our findings do not support that H. pylori is a primary pathogen of inflammatory changes seen in children studied, nor do they establish an association between H. pylori antral gastritis and migraine. However, our data strongly suggest that there is a gastrointestinal origin of these patients’ complaints.","","","","51e6b213ec1f1e72a94314281783b808f6cc4d6a","","","","","","The Role of Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Migraine","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51e6b213ec1f1e72a94314281783b808f6cc4d6a","","2003"

Xiao et al. presented RDH-EI that uses pixel value ordering (PVO) and additive homomorphism for encryption ensuring that the embedding capacity of plain and encrypted image remains relatively same. However, the size of location map required to manage over/under flow blocks increased drastically reducing the overall embedding capacity. In the paper, a new PVO-based separable RDH scheme is proposed using double encryption. The original image is encrypted using chaotic mapping in Phase 1, ensuring that the performance of PVO algorithm in an encrypted domain is similar to that in plain domain. Secret data is embedded in this encrypted image. The embedded image is re-encrypted using additive homomorphism to enhance security.

So, there is a need to have a robust mechanism to ensure the verification of any person before allowing him to access the stored data. So, for purposes of increasing the security level and privacy of users against attacks, cancelable biometrics can be utilized. The principal objective of cancelable biometrics is to generate new distorted biometric templates to be stored in biometric databases instead of the original ones. This paper presents effective methods based on different discrete transforms, such as Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), in addition to matrix rotation to generate cancelable biometric templates, in order to meet revocability and prevent the restoration of the original templates from the generated cancelable ones. Rotated versions of the images are generated in either spatial or transform domains and added together to eliminate the ability to recover the original biometric templates. The cancelability performance is evaluated and tested through extensive simulation results for all proposed methods on a different face and fingerprint datasets. Low Equal Error Rate (EER) values with high AROC values reflect the efficiency of the proposed methods, especially those dependent on DCT and DFrFT. Moreover, a comparative study is performed to evaluate the proposed method with all transformations to select the best one from the security perspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is carried out to test the performance of the proposed schemes with the existing schemes. The obtained outcomes reveal the efficiency of the proposed cancelable biometric schemes by introducing an average AROC of 0.998, EER of 0.0023, FAR of 0.008, and FRR of 0.003.","","","","3b2faebbcd6db568420d1565274a2dab61a9f8b0","","","","","","Discrete Transforms and Matrix Rotation Based Cancelable Face and Fingerprint Recognition for Biometric Security Applications","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b2faebbcd6db568420d1565274a2dab61a9f8b0","","2020"

Recent works of the literature in steganography have the threat of secret information being retrieved by an anonymous user. Some techniques do not support some image formats for embedding. To overcome the disadvantages associated with the existing algorithms, we proposed encryption-based steganography. Encryption algorithms play vital roles to protect original data from unauthorized access. In this paper, the cover image is separated into RGB components separately. Multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) transformation is applied over the transformed image components. Optimal pixels are selected using Multiobjective Whale Optimization. The secret image is split into RGB components. Encryption using Data Encryption Standard, Advanced Encryption Standard and Signcryption algorithms is performed over R, G and B separated components, respectively. The encrypted image is embedded into the selected pixel point of cover image. Inverse DWT is applied to retrieve the stego image.

"1009",":Paper","CC-BY","Query by Image Content (QBIC), subsequently known as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), offers an advantageous solution in a variety of applications, including medical, meteorological, search by image, and other applications. Such CBIR systems primarily use similarity matching algorithms to compare image content to get matched images from datasets. They essentially measure the spatial distance between extracted visual features from a query image and its similar versions in the dataset. One of the most challenging query retrieval problems is Facial Sketched-Real Image Retrieval (FSRIR), which is based on content similarity matching. These facial retrieval systems are employed in a variety of contexts, including criminal justice. The difficulties of retrieving such sorts come from the composition of the human face and its distinctive parts. In addition, the comparison between these types of images is made within two different domains. Besides, to our knowledge, there is a few large-scale facial datasets that can be used to assess the performance of the retrieval systems. The success of the retrieval process is governed by the method used to estimate similarity and the efficient representation of compared images. However, by effectively representing visual features, the main challenge-posing component of such systems might be resolved. Hence, this paper has several contributions that fill the research gap in content-based similarity matching and retrieval. The first contribution is extending the Chinese University Face Sketch (CUFS) dataset by including augmented images, introducing to the community a novel dataset named Extended Sketched-Real Image Retrieval (ESRIR). The CUFS dataset has been extended from 100 images to include 53,000 facial sketches and 53,000 real facial images. The paper second contribution is presenting three new systems for sketched-real image retrieval based on convolutional autoencoder, InfoGAN, and Vision Transformer (ViT) unsupervised models for large datasets. Furthermore, to meet the subjective demands of the users due to the prevalence of multiple query formats, the third contribution of the paper is to train and assess the performance of the proposed models on two additional facial datasets of different image types. Recently, the majority of people have preferred searching for brand logo images, but it may be tricky to separate certain brand logo features their alternatives and even from other features in an image. Thus, the fourth contribution is to compare logo image retrieval performance based on visual features derived from each of the three suggested retrieval systems. The paper also presents cloud-based energy and computational complexity saving approaches on large-scale datasets. Due to the ubiquity of touchscreen devices, users often make drawings based on their fantasies for certain object image searches. Thus, the proposed models are tested and assessed on a tough dataset of doodle-scratched human artworks. They are also studied on a multi-category dataset to cover practically all possible image types and situations. The results are compared with those of the most recent algorithms found in the literature. The results show that the proposed systems outperform the recent counterparts.","","","","f15d708bc04f14a186665439bbbbcee0c9b7fdf0","","","","","","Image Retrieval Using Convolutional Autoencoder, InfoGAN, and Vision Transformer Unsupervised Models","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f15d708bc04f14a186665439bbbbcee0c9b7fdf0","","2023"

This research work presents an efficient cancelable biometric recognition framework that exploits an irreversible hybrid encryption algorithm. It incorporates Deoxyribonucleic, Ribonucleic Acid sequence (DNA and RNA) encryption technique, and an evolutionary optimization technique, namely Genetic Algorithms (GAs). These techniques are employed to create completely deformed templates from their original ones. Hence, the main contribution is introducing a novel biometric security framework that achieves unique randomness characteristics using RNA and DNA sequences and the evolutionary GA technique. The proposed framework produces entirely deformed biometric templates by ciphering the main discriminative features of the biometric traits of the authorized clients. It is firstly initialized by creating several encrypted biometric images for the original users with the logistic map. After that, the initially encrypted images are transformed into vectors of a binary array. Then, they are converted to their corresponding introns, and exons, and consequently, their relevant codons are stored in the cloud database. These relevant codons are replaced by new ones after generating encrypted RNA lists. The utilized encryption key for each template is extracted from the original biometric image through excessive permutations between pixels. The GA optimization technique is applied to select the most convenient biometric features. Finally, after employing the GA-based cross-over and mutation operations, the chosen features are used to generate the cancelable biometric traits. To assess the proposed framework, six different biometric databases are considered. These databases are Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) Faces (gray), CASIA v.5 Faces (color), UPOL Iris (gray), Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) Ear (color and gray), Fingerprint, and CASIA Palmprint (color and gray). The security performance of the proposed encryption algorithm is compared to those of recent studies in this field, such as Optical Scanning Holography (OSH) and Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE). The simulation results prove the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of all adopted evaluation metrics. The proposed framework provides high Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AROC) curve that reaches 0.9990, low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.0015, more uniform histograms, high correlation values for genuine users, and completely hidden biometric features. In addition, from the security perspective, the proposed framework achieves good entropy, Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), and Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) values that reach 7.9960, 33.55%, and 99.65%, respectively.","","","","3d06a1c50f8489b8e64298b866f455a96c9b5e20","","","","","","A Cancelable Biometric Security Framework Based on RNA Encryption and Genetic Algorithms","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d06a1c50f8489b8e64298b866f455a96c9b5e20","","2022"

In this work, a cancelable biometric framework is introduced to satisfy user data security and keeping the original biometric template safe away from intruders. Thus, our main contribution is presenting a novel authentication framework based on the evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based encryption technique. The suggested framework produces an entirely unrecognized biometric template by hiding the whole discriminative features of biometric templates; this is with exploiting the outstanding characteristics of the employed Genetic operations of the utilized encryption technique. Firstly, the GA initiates its search from a population of templates, not a single template. Secondly, some statistical operators are used to exploit the resulting initial population to generate successive populations. Finally, the crossover and mutation operations are performed to produce the ultimate cancelable biometric templates. Different biometric databases of the face and fingerprint templates are tested and analyzed. The proposed cancelable biometric framework achieves appreciated sensitivity and specificity results compared to the conventional OSH (Optical Scanning Holography) algorithm. It accomplishes recommended outcomes in terms of the AROC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) and the probability correlation distribution between the original biometrics and the encrypted biometrics stored in the database.

In order to preserve the quality of the stego image, it is desired to limit the changes in the pixel groups as much as possible. Therefore, optimum strategies must be found to match the function of the pixel group to the secret digit with the least possible imposed distortion in terms of mean square error.

Purpose
This study aims to develop a trust mechanism in a Vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET) based on an optimized deep learning for selfish node detection.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors built a deep learning-based optimized trust mechanism that removes malicious content generated by selfish VANET nodes. This deep learning-based optimized trust framework is the combination of the Deep Belief Network-based Red Fox Optimization algorithm. A novel deep learning-based optimized model is developed to identify the type of vehicle in the non-line of sight (nLoS) condition. This authentication scheme satisfies both the security and privacy goals of the VANET environment. The message authenticity and integrity are verified using the vehicle location to determine the trust level. The location is verified via distance and time. It identifies whether the sender is in its actual location based on the time and distance.


Findings
A deep learning-based optimized Trust model is used to detect the obstacles that are present in both the line of sight and nLoS conditions to reduce the accident rate. While compared to the previous methods, the experimental results outperform better prediction results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, computational cost and communication overhead.


Practical implications
The experiments are conducted using the Network Simulator Version 2 simulator and evaluated using different performance metrics including computational cost, accuracy, precision, recall and communication overhead with simple attack and opinion tampering attack. However, the proposed method provided better prediction results in terms of computational cost, accuracy, precision, recall, and communication overhead than other existing methods, such as K-nearest neighbor and Artificial Neural Network. Hence, the proposed method highly against the simple attack and opinion tampering attacks.


Originality/value
This paper proposed a deep learning-based optimized Trust framework for trust prediction in VANET. A deep learning-based optimized Trust model is used to evaluate both event message senders and event message integrity and accuracy.

"1021",":Paper","CC-BY","PurposeOne of the challenging issues in computer vision and pattern recognition is face image recognition. Several studies based on face recognition were introduced in the past decades, but it has few classification issues in terms of poor performances. Hence, the authors proposed a novel model for face recognition.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed method consists of four major sections such as data acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction and recognition. Initially, the images are transferred into grayscale images, and they pose issues that are eliminated by resizing the input images. The contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) utilizes the image preprocessing step, thereby eliminating unwanted noise and improving the image contrast level. Second, the active contour and level set-based segmentation (ALS) with neural network (NN) or ALS with NN algorithm is used for facial image segmentation. Next, the four major kinds of feature descriptors are dominant color structure descriptors, scale-invariant feature transform descriptors, improved center-symmetric local binary patterns (ICSLBP) and histograms of gradients (HOG) are based on clour and texture features. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) with modified random forest (MRF) model for facial image recognition.FindingsExperimentally, the proposed method performance is evaluated using different kinds of evaluation criterions such as accuracy, similarity index, dice similarity coefficient, precision, recall and F-score results. However, the proposed method offers superior recognition performances than other state-of-art methods. Further face recognition was analyzed with the metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F-score and attained 99.2, 96, 98 and 96%, respectively.Originality/valueThe good facial recognition method is proposed in this research work to overcome threat to privacy, violation of rights and provide better security of data.","","","","715935f23549d91268fcf676e69ac6855899d0be","","","","","","An enhanced segmentation technique and improved support vector machine classifier for facial image recognition","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/715935f23549d91268fcf676e69ac6855899d0be","","2021"

There are various types of features that can be used to detect drowsiness. Detection can be done by utilizing behavioral data, physiological measurements and vehicle-based data. The existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models-based ensemble approach analyzed the behavioral data comprises eye or face or head movement captured by using a camera images or videos. However, the developed model suffered from the limitation of high computational cost because of the application of approximately 140 million parameters.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed model uses significant feature parameters from the feature extraction process such as ReliefF, Infinite, Correlation, Term Variance are used for feature selection. The features that are selected are undergone for classification using ensemble classifier.FindingsThe output of these models is classified into non-drowsiness or drowsiness categories.Research limitations/implicationsIn this research work higher end camera are required to collect videos as it is cost-effective. Therefore, researches are encouraged to use the existing datasets.Practical implicationsThis paper overcomes the earlier approach.

The interchange of patient data across health centers addresses the growth of the number of patients and minimizes needless trials. The sharing of medical information helps patient care to accelerate; thus the sharing of health data is a need nowadays. Due to the sharing of information online among healthcare professionals, safety remains a key concern. In a diagnostic method during the COVID-19 pandemic, computer tomography (CT) and X-ray photos play an essential role in the transmission of information to organizations. Steganography techniques of encryption and imaging can be used in order to secure transmission of COVID-19 pictures. This work proposes a novel encryption for COVID-19 diagnostic using the image steganography (EIS-SDT) paradigm for safe data transfer. For the breakdown of images, a discrete multiple-level transformer for EIS-SDT employs the technique for optimizing the pixel selection for MANTA RY Foraging. For secrete image encryption, the EIS-SDT approach employs a dual logistic chaotic map. Additional security for the steganography process is ensured by the implementation of the DLCM-based encryption mechanism. The EIS-SDT model is efficiently performed by thorough simulation results analysis, and the results are analyzed using many assessment parameters. The analysis showed that the EIS-SDT model exceeds existing technology considerably.","","","","9dc0397d53bd5550d0454f1f24b5ccf89d5d7d06","","","","","","Implementation of Encryption Technique for analysis of Image Transmission during COVID-19 Pandemic","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9dc0397d53bd5550d0454f1f24b5ccf89d5d7d06","","2021"
"1024",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","ABSTRACT Visual cryptography is an encryption technique that decomposes a secret image into multiple shares that are digitally ‘overlapped’ based on logical operations to recover the original secret image. Each individual share cannot reveal clues about the secret image. Existing visual cryptography schemes suffer from problems such as pixel expansion, high computational complexity and poor decryption quality. To overcome these problems, we propose a new 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme for color images based on the binary dragonfly algorithm. The dragonfly algorithm is used to determine optimal color levels for the encryption process, which leads to reconstructed images with the higher quality upon decryption with minimal effect on the overall computational complexity. The proposed scheme is also non-expansible, whereby the share images are of the same size as the original secret image. This leads to reduced memory requirements as well as improved image quality. We analyze the strength of the proposed scheme based on a standard set of metrics which includes an evaluation of its resistance against cryptanalytic attacks, histogram, correlation, entropy and encryption quality. Results show that the proposed visual cryptography scheme has desired properties such as improved recovered image quality, near-ideal statistical characteristics and fast encryption speed, depicting an improvement over existing schemes.","","","","37a128d1b24fe8e584b6f7c7cc6be109624b2f91","","","","","","An enhanced color visual cryptography scheme based on the binary dragonfly algorithm","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37a128d1b24fe8e584b6f7c7cc6be109624b2f91","","2020"
"1025",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","BACKGROUND
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) following ovulation induction is common and varies in severity from mild to severe. Severe OHSS can be life threatening and requires hospitalization and procedures to reduce the extracellular fluid accumulation. Ovulation induction regimen and patient characteristics such as young age and low body weight have been identified as risk factors for OHSS, and follicle count >20 may be predictive of increased risk for moderate to severe OHSS. Whether any other patient factors are important in this risk equation is unknown.


CASES
We report on 2 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and other autoimmune diseases who experienced a total of 4 episodes of OHSS, 2 of which were severe.


CONCLUSION
T1DM, with or without other concomitant autoimmune diseases, may increase the risk for severe OHSS. Awareness of the interaction of preexisting conditions and risk for vascular leak disorders is needed for comprehensive counseling prior to embarking on ovarian stimulation. Preventive measures may be important considerations in this population.","","","","afdbf118fbac47d54a5b442151e730a95b00a7f2","","","","","","Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in patients with autoimmune disorders: a report of two cases.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afdbf118fbac47d54a5b442151e730a95b00a7f2","","2014"

But in the case of acute rejection after liver transplantation, DSG was reported effective in just a few cases. From July 1991 to November 2005, 96 patients underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLTx) in our institution. Of them, 9 patients, including 4 ABO incompatible recipients, are presented. Rejection symptoms that did not respond to steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone, 10-20 mg/kg/day for 3 days) and were treated with DSG (3 or 5 mg/kg/day) for 4 to 14 days together with a maintenance dose of the steroid. Among them, five responded to treatment with DSG, two did not respond and the other two patients were not evaluated. Six of the nine patients are symptom free at present. Complications such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were successfully treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor or by platelet transfusion. No recipient died as a direct consequence of the complications induced by DSG. DSG proved effective and safe for some of the LDLTx recipients with steroid-resistant acute rejection but it was not effective for the treatment of accelerated humoral rejection in ABO incompatible recipients.","","","","9a74d2d77462fb327dad78e8be86c4814301dd46","","","","","","Usage of deoxyspergualin on steroid-resistant acute rejection in living donor liver transplantation.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a74d2d77462fb327dad78e8be86c4814301dd46","","2006"
"1029",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","The studies discussed in this review suggest that DSG is a potent immunosuppressive agent, with at least some of its activity due to its direct effects on macrophages and B cells. The effects of DSG on macrophages include inhibition of IL-1, chemiluminescence, expression of MHC Class I antigen on the surface, and development of MAF. The agent may well interfere with antigen processing and the discovery of its binding to the heat-shock protein 70 may shed some light on this area. The effects of DSG on B lymphocytes include inhibition of surface Ig expression and B cell differentiation. In addition, however, DSG exhibits some effects on both B and T lymphocytes and is markedly active in blocking both the primary and secondary cytotoxic T cell and antibody-producing cell generation. The agent is relatively nontoxic at the doses in which it exerts these marked effects. Thus, an overall assessment of DSG shows that it may provide immune suppression at levels different from those of immunosuppressive agents already available. Advances in human organ transplantation have for the most part occurred stepwise with the introduction of progressively improved techniques of immunosuppression. Tissue-matching, organ preservation, techniques of transplantation, and surgical post-operative care of organ transplant recipients have all improved over the 30 years since organ transplantation began, but have not been the major factors in the improved survival of both patients and grafts seen at the present time. The initial advance in immunosuppression which made the first organ transplants possible was the finding of the immunosuppressive capabilities of azathioprine (Imuran) and the ability to reverse acute rejection crisis with prednisone. Anti-thymocyte or anti-lymphocyte globulin, introduced in 1966, achieved variable results, with some groups reporting excellent patient and graft survival using this agent. Others using different variations of this drug showed no improvement in results. By the mid-1970s, transplant results had improved at a number of units, with graft survivals of kidney and heart recipients in the 70 percent range at 1 to 2 years. No major progress was reported in most units, however, until the introduction in 1978 of cyclosporine. A major effect of cyclosporine was to create a universal improvement in graft survival in all units surveyed around the world with a 70 to 75 percent one-year cadaver kidney graft survival, representing the basic standard for clinical results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","","","","ed8f1c270dc0e4f43f9e4cc51bed5d0f6acd329f","","","","","","15‐Deoxyspergualin: A Novel Immunosuppressive Drug with Clinical Potential a","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed8f1c270dc0e4f43f9e4cc51bed5d0f6acd329f","","1993"
"1030",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Research on new, experimental immunosuppressive drugs (such as FK 506, rapamycin, RS61443, brequinar sodium and deoxyspergualin) with distinct and diverse modes of action has gathered considerable momentum. This surge of interest dates from reports, in 1987, of the capacity of the novel macrolide antibiotic FK 506 to inhibit selectively, CD4+ T cell activation and the production of IL-2 and other cytokines [1]—a property shared with cyclosporin A (CsA). Despite its enormous contribution to the greatly improved success of organ transplantation over the past decade, CsA is potentially nephrotoxie and exhibits other side effects. Agents with a higher therapeutic index are needed. Another factor, which has promoted development of new immunosuppressive drugs within a traditionally risk-averse pharmaceutical industry, is the proven efficacy of CsA in certain autoimmune diseases with presumed T cell pathogeneses. These disorders include psoriasis, uveitis, insulindependent diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis [2,3] and recently, severe, steroid-dependent asthma [4]. In these conditions, patients previously unresponsive to or intolerant of maximal existing immunosuppressive therapy may respond to CsA. Nevertheless, available therapies for autoimmune disease remain unsatisfactory. In the search for effective, safe, 'new' drugs, which can be used alone or in combination, experimental agents such as FK 506 and RS61443 have already entered the clinic, whilst 'older' drugs, such as rapamycin (a close structural analogue of FK 506) and mycophenolic acid (the active moiety of RS61443) have regained attention in a new light. The inhibitory effects of two antilymphocytic drugs, rapamycin [5] and CP 17193 [6], on experimental autoimmune disease (type 1 diabetes and lupus, respectively) are featured in this issue of Clinical and Experimental Immunology.","","","","b6df66bcc7ee4c3fde9f64b01d2bd4085c9ec06e","","","","","","The spectrum of action of new immunosuppressive drugs","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6df66bcc7ee4c3fde9f64b01d2bd4085c9ec06e","","1992"

It is therefore essential to develop the precise and fast measurement of anti-A and anti-B antibodies (Abs) to prevent humoral rejection in ABO-I liver transplantation. Agglutination titer has been the standard method to measure these Abs, but the interpretation of the results is subject to bias. Here, we have developed an objective and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure anti-A and anti-B Abs. This test requires only a small amount (10 microl) of recipient's serum. We applied the newly developed ELISA to monitor living donor liver transplant recipients and investigated the correlation between ELISA and agglutination titer. The Spearman's correlation coefficient for Abs ranged from 0.461 to 0.812. Moreover, in one case of humoral rejection, the increase of Abs was detected by ELISA one day earlier than by the agglutination titer. In conclusion, our ELISA method proved useful to detect an increase of anti-A and anti-B Abs titers at an early stage, thereby contributing to a prompt treatment of humoral rejection due to ABO-I.","","","","eb8f420ba10e0f5613429dd28c1b584d4a54efd6","","","","","","Development of a novel ELISA for detection of anti-A and anti-B antibodies in recipients of ABO-incompatible living donor liver grafts.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb8f420ba10e0f5613429dd28c1b584d4a54efd6","","2007"

At 9 years 6 months after transplantation, the patient presented with the elevated serum levels of liver enzymes and total bilirubin. A liver biopsy showed acute cellular rejection. Steroid bolus therapy was not effective, but we successfully used deoxyspergualin as a rescue therapy. Late acute cellular rejection that occurs nearly 10 years after transplantation has so far been rarely reported.

"1042",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a molecular chaperone that is expressed in response to stress. In this role, Hsp70 binds to its protein substrates and stabilize them against denaturation or aggregation until conditions improve.1 In addition to its functions during a stress response, Hsp70 has multiple responsibilities during normal growth; it assists in the folding of newly synthesized proteins,2, 3 the subcellular transport of proteins and vesicles,4 the formation and dissociation of complexes,5 and the degradation of unwanted proteins.6, 7 Thus, this chaperone broadly shapes protein homeostasis by controlling protein quality control and turnover during both normal and stress conditions.8 Consistent with these diverse activities, genetic and biochemical studies have implicated it in a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, allograft rejection and infection. This review provides a brief review of Hsp70 structure and function and then explores some of the emerging opportunities (and challenges) for drug discovery.

Hsp70 is Highly Conserved
Members of the Hsp70 family are ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved; for example, the major Hsp70 from Escherichia coli, termed DnaK, is approximately 50% identical to human Hsp70s.9 Eukaryotes often express multiple Hsp70 family members with major isoforms found in all the cellular compartments: Hsp72 (HSPA1A) and heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70/HSPA8) in the cytosol and nucleus, BiP (Grp78/HSPA5) in the endoplasmic reticulum and mtHsp70 (Grp75/mortalin/HSPA9) in mitochondria. Some of the functions of the cytosolic isoforms, Hsc70 and Hsp72, are thought to be redundant, but the transcription of Hsp72 is highly responsive to stress and Hsc70 is constitutively expressed. In the ER and mitochondria, the Hsp70 family members are thought to fulfill specific functions and have unique substrates, with BiP playing key roles in the folding and quality control of ER proteins and mtHsp70 being involved in the import and export of proteins from the mitochondria. For the purposes of this review, we will often use Hsp70 as a generic term to encompass the shared properties of the family members.","","","","2ba44b847a6990a7aed573a6a13ae62e75308537","","","","","","Heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) as an emerging drug target.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ba44b847a6990a7aed573a6a13ae62e75308537","","2010"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of IL-4 and IL-10 in prolonged allograft survival induced by T-cell depletion plus DSG. MHC mismatched skin allograft transplantation was performed, using wild-type and three separate knockout (i.e., IL-4–/–, Stat6–/-, or IL-10–/–) mice as recipients. Induction therapy consisted of T-cell depletion and or brief course of DSG. The data demonstrate that monotherapy with T-cell-depleting mAbs or DSG prolonged skin allograft survival, compared to controls, in wild-type Balb/c recipients [median survival time (MST) = 25 and 21 vs. 10 days, p < 0.007]. T-cell depletion plus DSG further augmented skin allograft survival in wild-type animals relative to monotherapy (MST = 35 days vs. 25 and 21 days, p < 0.006 vs. mAbs or DSG only), and was equally effective in IL-4–/– and Stat6–/– recipients. In contrast, combined therapy was no better than monotherapy in IL-10–/– animals (p > 0.05). Furthermore, skin allograft survival after combined therapy was shorter in IL-10–/– versus wild-type recipients (MST 20 and 41 days, respectively, p < 0.001). IL-4-mediated signaling through Stat6 is dispensable for prolonged allograft survival induced by T-cell depletion plus DSG. In contrast, IL-10 appears to be important for prolonged allograft survival induced by combined therapy in this model.","","","","d65a0010daaec5b64344eb3d4c92ec61edf3be36","","","","","","IL-10 and IL-4 in Skin Allograft Survival Induced by T-Cell Depletion plus Deoxyspergualin","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d65a0010daaec5b64344eb3d4c92ec61edf3be36","","2008"

In the present study, the stability of functional α‐ and β‐cell mass and metabolic function was assessed in streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced diabetic primates following PIT in the absence of CIT. Diabetes was induced in rhesus macaques with STZ, 140 mg/kg. Hyperglycemia was reversed rapidly by PIT coupled with a 14‐day tolerance induction protocol based on F(Ab)2‐IT and DSG (n = 7). Two diabetic animals received the tolerance induction protocol without PIT. Acute rejection was presented in three animals at 70, 353 and 353 days post transplant in the tolerance induction protocol, whereas the controls [F(Ab)2‐IT or DSG alone] showed early 10‐day function but all lost islet function by days 15–70. One recipient [F(Ab)2‐IT or DSG] died euglycemic after a surgical procedure on day 187. At 2 years, three animals studied had a normal FIM evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test, mixed meal test, acute insulin response to glucose, glucose disposal rate, and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp. PIT in STZ‐induced diabetic primates resulted in restoration of normal α‐ and β‐cell function. Operational tolerance induction was achieved with only peritransplant administration of F(Ab)2‐IT and DSG sparing the animals from chronic exposure of diabetogenic immunosuppressive drugs. These results offer an exciting new potential for treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.","","","","42330d3a87f71d8ec9f4c3a172f6f46b4ae9fcae","","","","","","Stable α‐ and β‐Islet Cell Function After Tolerance Induction to Pancreatic Islet Allografts in Diabetic Primates","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42330d3a87f71d8ec9f4c3a172f6f46b4ae9fcae","","2003"

"1049",":Paper","CC-BY","BACKGROUND
LF15-0195 is a novel immunosuppressant that is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of vasculitis. This study examined whether LF15-0195 could suppress the induction and progression of rat anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis.


METHODS
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was induced in primed rats by the administration of anti-GBM serum. In the first experiment, LF15-0195 was given daily by subcutaneous injection (days 0 to 14) to treat the induction of anti-GBM disease analyzed at day 14. In a second experiment, rats received LF15-0195 as an intervention treatment from days 7 to 28 (continuous therapy) or days 7 to 12 (pulse therapy) to treat the progression of disease assessed at day 28.


RESULTS
Continuous LF15-0195 treatment during the induction of anti-GBM disease (experiment 1) prevented proteinuria and loss of renal function, and markedly reduced histological kidney lesions and renal fibrosis. LF15-0195 also reduced kidney leukocyte infiltrate, urine excretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and the serum antibody response, but not kidney deposition of Ig and C3. When LF15-0195 treatment was initiated at day 7, both continuous and pulse therapy partially inhibited disease progression by suppressing the loss of renal function, interstitial macrophage and T-cell accumulation, tubular cell proliferation, and renal fibrosis.


CONCLUSION
LF15-0195 prevents the induction and suppresses the progression of rat anti-GBM disease through multiple mechanisms of action, suggesting that this drug may have significant therapeutic potential in human glomerulonephritis. The similar efficacy of continuous and pulse intervention treatment in this model indicates that short-term LF15-0195 treatment may achieve optimal benefit without prolonged bone marrow suppression.","","","","818773f9a4aab608b6fd11c807d21dc9b51e4dfc","","","","","","LF15-0195 prevents the induction and inhibits the progression of rat anti-GBM disease.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/818773f9a4aab608b6fd11c807d21dc9b51e4dfc","","2001"

"1052",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Anti-neoplastic cytostatic antiproliferative agents, such as methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine and cyclophosphamide, were originally used as immunosuppressive drugs. Although these agents induced only modest anti-rejection activity, they caused serious non-specific bone marrow suppression, impairing host resistance and increasing the incidence of infections. Unlike these non-selective agents, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and sirolimus act more selectively on different stages of the T-lymphocyte (T-cell) and B-lymphocyte (B-cell) activation cycles; however, cyclosporine and tacrolimus are nephrotoxic, whereas sirolimus causes hypertriglyceridaemia. Thus, despite this progress, continued efforts must be made to develop and test new, potentially very selective agents. The agent 15-deoxyspergualin moderately inhibits both mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) but does not affect the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Another drug, FTY720, has a unique action to prevent rejection, by altering the homing of lymphocytes to the lymphoid compartments. The newest members of the family of antiproliferative agents, namely mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide and brequinar, are potentially more selective than their predecessors. However, the most promising agents are produced using antisense technology. This approach involves the design of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; these novel drugs are designed to block allograft rejection by blocking selected messenger RNA (mRNA). This review outlines the mechanisms of action, the limitations of application and the molecular or cellular targets of traditional agents, newly developed drugs and also antisense technology, which is an example of a new application of molecular medicine.","","","","ae27ad7ba4c297db9ff9cf7640a69cb7aa76e0f8","","","","","","Molecular targets for existing and novel immunosuppressive drugs","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae27ad7ba4c297db9ff9cf7640a69cb7aa76e0f8","","2000"

Day of transplant T cell depletion with anti-CD3 immunotoxin or F(Ab)2 immunotoxin induces stable tolerance to renal allografts in rhesus monkeys given 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG), a NF-kappaB inhibitor that suppresses proinflammatory cytokine (PC) production. Because PC and NF-kappaB are involved in dendritic cell (DC) maturation, we asked if impaired DC maturation and Th2-type cytokine deviation might be related to the synergistic effect of DSG in this novel model.


METHODS
Immunosuppression was initiated 4 hr before transplanting a major histocompatibility complex mismatched renal allograft. Some groups received a supplemental 5-day course of cyclosporine A or DSG or a 15-day course of DSG. Peripheral lymph nodes were sequentially examined for presence of mature DC. In vitro effects of DSG on PC-induced maturation of DC were also examined.


RESULTS
Allografts survived without rejection in 87% of recipients given immunotoxin or F(Ab)2 immunotoxin with DSG x 15 days, in 50% with DSG x 5 days, and 0% with cyclosporine A. The longest DSG survivors are >1000 days with normal graft function and tolerance validated, including acceptance of challenge second donor kidneys without treatment. DSG-treated recipients were unique in developing polarized Th2-type plasma cytokines. In DSG recipients, mature DC were significantly reduced in day +5 lymph node biopsies, with complete repopulation by 30 days. In vitro studies verified an inhibitory effect of DSG on DC maturation.


CONCLUSIONS
The study suggests DSG arrests DC maturation. The unusual synergy of immunotoxin and DSG apparently involves coincidental reduction in lymph node T cell mass and mature DC, a transient circumstance favoring development of stable tolerance.","","","","c7e0d66abecf52471cd4ae88110051eda34a8334","","","","","","Peritransplant tolerance induction in macaques: early events reflecting the unique synergy between immunotoxin and deoxyspergualin.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7e0d66abecf52471cd4ae88110051eda34a8334","","1999"
"1055",":Paper","CC-BY","Long‐term survival of a concordant xenograft can be achieved by using cyclosporine (CyA) and deoxyspergualin (DSG) for immunosuppression. We have demonstrated in a mouse‐to‐rat heterotopic heart transplantation model that DSG treatment can be stopped after 4 weeks with the grafts remaining beating. In this investigation we have sequentially characterized the morphological changes and infiltrating cells in the transplanted hearts. Graft recipients were killed 9 days, 28 days and 56 days after transplantation. At days 9 and 28, the grafts exhibited a well‐preserved morphology, with infiltrating cells restricted only to the periphery. These cells stained positive for rat MHC class II antigens, the ED1‐macrophage marker and the CD4 antigen, and were thus considered to be macrophages. In comparison, grafts harvested at day 56 had signs of interstitial fibrosis and some arteries showed pronounced intimal thickening. There was a moderate infiltrate of cells both in the peripheral and central parts of the graft, consisting mainly of MHC class II+/CD4+/ED1+ macrophages. Very few T cells and NK cells were noticed. Termination of DSG after 28 days does not trigger a humoral rejection. However, the grafts exhibit morphological changes equivalent to those seen in chronic allograft rejection. In addition, the characteristics of the infiltrating cells conformed with cellular infiltrates associated with chronic allograft rejection. Hence, this model could in the future prove to be useful for studies of mechanisms involved in chronic xenograft rejection.","","","","2d0d33e71c3f528e2d28bcd42e42b42373afef75","","","","","","A Morphological Sequential Study of Mouse‐to‐Rat Cardiac Xenografts","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d0d33e71c3f528e2d28bcd42e42b42373afef75","","1998"
"1056",":Paper","CC-BY","Local immunosuppression is based on the rationale that one can simultaneously prevent rejection and reduce systemic side effects by administering appropriately chosen immunosuppressive agents directly into the allograft. We utilized a mongrel canine renal transplant model with a programmable, implantable pump/catheter system to estimate the first-pass extraction of 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG) during renal artery infusion and to compare the efficacy and toxicity of continuous intraarterial (ia) versus intravenous (iv) DSG delivery. Six autotransplanted dogs were given DSG by both iv bolus (1 mg/kg) and ia infusion (1.0 mg/kg/d). DSG was administered to allograft recipients by continuous ia infusion at 0.5 (n = 11) and 0.75 (n = 8) mg/kg/day and by continuous iv infusion at 0.5 (n = 12) and 0.75 (n = 6) mg/kg/day. Mean +/- SD elimination half-life was 0.6 +/- 0.1 hr, and the transplanted kidney removed as much as 55-88% (mean 66%) of locally infused DSG. When compared with untreated controls [mean survival time (MST) = 8 days], low-dose (0. 5 mg/kg/day) DSG produced a significant antirejection effect when given ia (MST = 12 days; P = 0.04) but not iv (MST = 9 days; P = 0. 09), with equivalent overall mean drug levels during normal renal function. However, two of the four longest-surviving animals in the ia group died from severe systemic toxicity, manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, and sepsis. High-dose (0.75 mg/kg/day) DSG significantly prolonged survival via both local (MST = 12 days; P = 0.04) and systemic (MST = 11 days; P = 0.02) routes, but half of the iv-treated dogs died from, and four of the longer-surviving ia-treated animals manifested signs of, systemic toxicity, with significantly higher mean drug levels in the iv group. DSG significantly suppressed vascular rejection at both doses when administered locally and systemically, dose-dependently affected the severity of tubulointerstitial rejection and graft edema, and was not nephrotoxic. Our autotransplant pharmacokinetic data overestimated the allografted kidney's ability to extract DSG during local infusion of slightly lower, but immunosuppressive, doses, so that death from systemic toxicity was not prevented and a direct survival benefit of ia vs iv therapy was not realized. Local DSG administration might be combined with other immunosuppressants to therapeutic advantage.","","","","3c115cc59dd3d92f8c9c8bdd3710a37e492d3ac3","","","","","","Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 15-deoxyspergualin in a canine renal allograft model of local immunosuppression.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c115cc59dd3d92f8c9c8bdd3710a37e492d3ac3","","1997"

"1058",":Paper","CC-BY","An examination of the mechanisms by which four new immunosuppressive drugs—rapamycin, mizoribine, mycophenolate mofetil, and 15‐deoxyspergualin—exert their effects reveals three major categories. Rapamycin binds to an intracellular immunophilin. The resulting drug‐immunophilin complex inhibits the action of cytokines, thus blocking the activation and proliferation of T cells. Mizoribine and mycophenolate mofetil are antimetabolites that inhibit a key enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. As a result, the proliferation of T cells and B cells is inhibited selectively compared with that of nonlymphoid cells because the salvage pathway is unavailable to lymphocytes. Finally, 15‐deoxyspergualin has a unique mechanism of action, which includes suppressive effects on macrophage function, the induction of cytolytic T cells, B‐cell reactivity, and antibody responses. The demonstrated synergism among certain immunosuppressants allows reduction in the dose of each agent to minimize the individual toxicities. As more of these new agents become available, it is likely that azathioprine will be replaced, and it may be possible to eliminate the need for long‐term maintenance steroid therapy.","","","","b41f3fd585e80b65f00dce3afc03c1804dab3f00","","","","","","New Immunosuppressive Drugs in Organ Transplantation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b41f3fd585e80b65f00dce3afc03c1804dab3f00","","1996"

Xenotransplantation--the transplantation of organs and tissues between animal species--would supply an unlimited number of organs and offer many other advantages. The pig has been identified as the most suitable donor animal. Pig organs, when transplanted into humans or nonhuman primates, are, however, rejected hyperacutely within minutes by antibody-mediated complement activation. Human anti-pig antibodies have been identified as being directed against Gal alpha1-3galactose epitopes on pig vascular endothelium. Major efforts are being made to overcome this hyperacute rejection. Methods being investigated include (i) depletion or inhibition of recipient antibodies or complement, (ii) development of transgenic pigs that do not express the alphaGal epitope and/or express a human complement inhibiting protein (e.g. DAF), and (iii) development of immunological tolerance to pig organs in the recipient. If complement activation is prevented, e.g. by inhibition of complement activation by cobra venom factor, soluble complement receptor 1 or by the use of hDAF transgenic pig organs, then ""delayed xenograft rejection"" occurs and is again believed to be largely antibody-dependent. Experimental pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation is now, however, resulting in transplant function for days and weeks rather than minutes, and there is therefore optimism that we are on the threshold of a new era in the field of the transplantation of vital organs.","","","","0918dd48ee1031fb01fadf79fb1fef6d9e8f7ab7","","","","","","Xenotransplantation--state of the art.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0918dd48ee1031fb01fadf79fb1fef6d9e8f7ab7","","1996"

In clear contrast, a later control point, the CD4+8+ --> CD4+8- or CD4-8+ transition, dependent on the display of a conventional alpha:beta TCR complex, appeared unaffected, as did activation of mature T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, preB cell differentiation in the bone marrow was blocked at a precisely equivalent point: the A-C --> C' transition, controlled by expression of a pre-receptor complex containing the Ig heavy, but not light, chain.

A novel immunomodulatory drug, deoxyspergualin (DSG), has shown potential to suppress antimouse antibody response in preclinical model systems. We conducted a Phase I trial to determine the effect of DSG on HAMA response to murine mAb L6 administered to patients with advanced cancers (in previous trials, this antibody elicited HAMA in two-thirds of the treated patients). L6 mAb was administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg/m2 on days 1-5. DSG was administered at doses of 50 mg/m2 [dose level (dl) 1] or 150 mg/m2 (dls II and III) on days 1-7. Treatment courses were repeated every 6 weeks (dls I and II) or every 3 weeks (dl III). HAMAs were quantitated by a commercially available ELISA assay (ImmuSTRIP; anti-isotypic antibodies) and a radiometric assay (antiisotypic and anti-idiotypic antibodies). Pharmacokinetics of L6 and DSG was also studied in all consenting patients. Among 24 evaluable patients, 2 patients developed detectable HAMAs using the ELISA (one each at dls I and II) after a median follow-up of 122 days (P = 0.0001 as compared to historical controls). Even in the two patients who developed HAMA, the HAMA levels were quite low (160 and 181 ng/ml; historical experience, 70-38,744 ng/ml). The radiometric assay detected anti-L6 antibodies in 13 patients (4, 6, and 3 at dls I-III, respectively) after a median of 82 days. The median highest anti-L6 antibody level was 129 ng/ml (range, 21-2150). The highest anti-L6 antibody level at dl III was only 44 ng/ml. The results suggest suppression of anti-idiotypic response also. No clinical antitumor activity was observed, and no significant changes in T4/T8 subsets or immunoglobulins occurred (suggesting a lack of generalized immunosuppression). We conclude that DSG can suppress HAMA response to L6.

"1066",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Cyclosporine (CsA) and FK506 are structurally unrelated immunosuppressants, but function in similar ways. FK506 and rapamycin (RAPA), on the other hand, have structural similarities, but act by different mechanisms to yield immunosuppression. Besides their immunosuppressive action, CsA and FK506 are known to interfere with T-cell development. CsA treatment after lethal X-irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation results in autoimmune disease, which is referred to as CsA-induced autoimmunity. In this study, we examined the effect of RAPA on T-cell development by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry in female Lewis and Brown Norway rats. Irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation were performed before a 4-week course of RAPA administration to determine de novo T-cell development in relation to possible autoimmune phenomena. RAPA interfered with the maturation of thymocytes to the CD4+CD8+ DP stage, which resulted in a relative increase in TCRalphabeta(-) immature thymocytes, localized in a rim along the outer cortex. The thymus of RAPA-treated animals had a thinner cortex, leading to stronger thymic atrophy. In the periphery, only a few T cells were observed at the end of RAPA treatment. In the Lewis rat, a normal CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio and an increased Th1/Th2 ratio was observed within the T-cell population. Six weeks after cessation of RAPA therapy, the T-cell compartment was restored to normal, with respect to number and phenotype. In Brown Norway rats, however, T-cell areas were barely detectable at the end of RAPA treatment. The CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was decreased as a result of a lower number of CD4 T cells; the Th1/Th2 ratio was increased but Th2 remained higher. Similar to Lewis rats, the situation was almost normalized 6 weeks after cessation of RAPA administration. However, Brown Norway rats, in contrast to Lewis rats, showed T-cell infiltration and concomitant induction of MHC class II in the submandibular salivary gland, as well as insulitis, in the pancreas. Possible relationships to Sjogren's disease and diabetes remain to be established.","","","","f8c807d886b143ec30c518ee3e43fa25388091e4","","","","","","Effect of in vivo rapamycin treatment on de novo T-cell development in relation to induction of autoimmune-like immunopathology in the rat.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8c807d886b143ec30c518ee3e43fa25388091e4","","1996"

Toward this end we studied the effects of combined treatment with CsA and DSP on the course of IDDM in the diabetes‐prone (DP)‐BB rat. The results show that two ‘low’ doses of CsA (2mg/kg) and DSP (1mg/kg) that are clinically ineffective in suppressing IDDM development in BB rats when administered alone under a prolonged prophylactic regimen (30–105 days old), may successfully prevent, but not cure, the disease when given contemporaneously under the same experimental conditions. The combined treatment was well tolerated, and no side effects were noticed. These data suggest that the combined use of CsA and DSP may deserve consideration for its possible application in the prevention/treatment of human IDDM and other autoimmune diseases.","","","","c6557c60cb86f1dee1c51870b9c9c8b30007dacb","","","","","","Synergistic effect of deoxyspergualin (DSP) and cyclosporin A (CsA) in the prevention of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in BB rats","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6557c60cb86f1dee1c51870b9c9c8b30007dacb","","1996"

The NOD mouse model has clinical and histoimmunological features similar to those of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The SEB- and LPS-treated BALB/c mouse models exhibit pathogenic similarities with human septic shock conditions. In the NOD mouse, fusidin suppressed the spontaneous development of insulitis (mean inhibition 73%) and hyperglycaemia (IDDM incidence 25% versus 0%) when administered at 40 mg/kg five times weekly for 8 consecutive weeks from the fourth week of age; concurrently treated animals exhibited reduced percentages of splenic T lymphocytes. This anti-diabetogenic effect was confirmed in the accelerated model of diabetes induced in the NOD mouse with cyclophosphamide (CY) (IDDM incidence 55% versus 21-6% using dosages of fusidin from 40 to 80 mg/kg five times weekly); protection from IDDM development was achieved even when the drug (80 mg/kg/day) was first administered 7 days after CY challenge. In contrast, fusidin did not reverse hyperglycaemia when administered to CY-treated animals within 3 days of IDDM development. In the two models of septic shock, prophylactic treatment with fusidin, 80 mg/kg given three times for 2 days prior to D-Gal/SEB or D-Gal/LPS challenge, drastically reduced the lethality compared with D-Gal/buffer-treated mice. This effect may depend on the inhibitory action of fusidin on the secretion of cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, the serum levels of which were greatly diminished in the fusidin-treated mice (mean inhibition 50-90%). These results demonstrate that fusidin may have a role in the treatment of cell-mediated autoimmune diseases and cytokine-mediated infectious diseases in humans.","","","","9b2bcfaee0540cdee512a98706d84ae8acbbfa55","","","","","","Effects of sodium fusidate in animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and septic shock.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b2bcfaee0540cdee512a98706d84ae8acbbfa55","","1995"

"1072",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent inhibitor of T-cell activation, has been shown to have several effects on thymocyte maturation, thymic stromal cells, and the generation of autoreactive T cells. In Lewis rats, the combination of lethal irradiation, syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, and a 4-week course of CsA administration causes the development of an autoimmune disease (CsA-AI) resembling allogeneic graft-versus-host disease. This occurs upon withdrawal of CsA, provided the thymus receives irradiation and is present during CsA treatment. In this study, the separate effects of irradiation or CsA treatment on thymic stromal cells and thymocytes, compared to the combinatory effects, were examined using immunohistochemistry and tricolor flow cytometric analysis. CsA treatment causes an involution of the thymic medulla and a strong reduction of the cell number of thymocytes and stromal cells residing in the medulla. However, within the remaining medullary area, changes in cell distribution and antigen density on these cells were not observed. Irradiation on the other hand causes a strong depletion of thymocytes. The thymocyte population is recovered within 2 weeks and a cortical and medullary region can be distinguished. CsA treatment in combination with irradiation results in a strongly inhibited recovery of the medulla during CsA treatment, whereas the cortex recovers to normal size and morphology. The presence of the medullary IDC and epithelial cells is reduced proportionally to the small size of the medulla. However, the distribution of these stromal cells is normal. During the CsA administration, the thymuses from irradiated and CsA-treated rats are very similar to thymuses from CsA-treated rats. In conclusion, no changes specific for irradiation plus CsA treatment have been observed. Regarding the distribution and size of medullary stromal cells and residing thymocytes, thymuses from irradiated and CsA-treated rats hardly differ from the thymuses from rats treated only with CsA. Therefore, irradiation seems essential in the generation of CsA-AI by eliminating suppressor-cell circuits in the periphery.","","","","cc49e1590d16b6e18e34ba5a6d3c43f725eb2e0a","","","","","","Differential Effects of X-Irradiation and Cyclosporin-A Administration on the Thymus with Respect to the Generation of Cyclosporin-A-Induced Autoimmunity","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc49e1590d16b6e18e34ba5a6d3c43f725eb2e0a","","1995"

Prior to the CY challenge (350 mg/kg body weight), female euglycemic NOD mice were randomly divided into three groups (A–C). Groups B and C were treated daily from 1 day before to 13 days after the CY challenge with sIL‐1R at doses of 0.2 and 2 mg/kg body weight. Group A was treated with PBS. By 2 weeks after CY administration, an acute form of autoimmune diabetes with glycosuria, hyperglycemia and severe insulitis occurred in the majority (13/20, 65%) of the control mice (group A). In contrast, repeated injections with sIL‐1R protected NOD mice from insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) development in a dose‐dependent fashion; the incidence of IDDM was 53.3% (8/15) in the mice treated with 0.2 mg/kg and only 6.7% (1/15) in those treated with 2 mg/kg. However, none of the doses of the sIL‐1R reduced the extent of insulitis in NOD mice. Importantly, the anti‐diabetogenic property of sIL‐1R may not involve major T cell function impairment; accordingly, in parallel experiments, splenic lymphoid cells from NOD mice not challenged with CY, but treated with 2 mg/kg sIL‐1R for 5 consecutive days showed a normal distribution of mononuclear cell subsets and maintained their capacity to secrete interferon‐γ and IL‐2 and to proliferate in response to polyclonal mitogenic stimulation with concanavalin A.","","","","830130f7df5592bc209cf4f24c5f3b4d4dbbcd2a","","","","","","Protection from experimental autoimmune diabetes in the non‐obese diabetic mouse with soluble interleukin‐1 receptor","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/830130f7df5592bc209cf4f24c5f3b4d4dbbcd2a","","1994"

Twenty‐eight days after primary immunization, histological and serological signs of EAT occurred in control mice treated with PBS which showed marked lymphoid infiltration of the thyroid glands along with increased serum titres of anti‐pTg antibodies. Development of both these EAT features was significantly suppressed when the mice were treated with 2.5 mg/kg body weight DSP, given daily, five times a week, from day —2 to day + 28 after immunization. The effect appeared to be dose‐dependent and DSP was ineffective when given under the same experimental conditions at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight.

These results provide further evidence for the powerful immunosuppressive properties of DSP and suggest that this drug may be used in the treatment of autoimmune thyroid diseases and other T‐cell mediated autoimmune disorders in humans.","","","","263f59330a8ba5b361c1093bb5f4626ed3f5d8d1","","","","","","Protection from Experimental Autoimmune Thyroiditis in CBA Mice with the Novel Immunosuppressant Deoxyspergualin","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/263f59330a8ba5b361c1093bb5f4626ed3f5d8d1","","1994"

Newer, similar-acting anti-T-cell agents such as FK-506 and rapamycin may be more effective; therefore a comparison was made with cyclosporin A to assess their inhibitory action on T-cell responses and keratinocyte proliferation. Using a guinea-pig model of delayed-type hypersensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), drugs were given systemically (25 mg/kg cyclosporin A, rapamycin; 2.5 mg/kg FK-506) and topically (0.02% and 2%) at the time of DNFB challenge or several hours after and were assessed with respect to erythema and the numbers of infiltrating T lymphocytes entering skin-challenge sites. FK-506, at all concentrations, significantly inhibited both T-cell infiltration and skin reddening when used by both routes. Rapamycin displayed no inhibitory effect, whereas cyclosporin A only suppressed the erythema response when given systemically. The inhibition of normal human keratinocyte growth by the drugs was assessed using a protein dye-binding assay. After 2 weeks, FK-506 had no effect, whereas cyclosporin A and rapamycin both inhibited keratinocyte growth in a dose-dependent fashion and almost equivalently in serum-containing and serum-free keratinocyte growth medium. The findings showed that in vivo only FK-506 suppressed T-cell involvement in sensitized animals. In contrast, it failed to have any effect on keratinocyte growth, whereas rapamycin was more potent than cyclosporin A in inhibiting their proliferation. The future benefit of these drugs in dermatology may ultimately lie in their combined use.","","","","3396d4042b06a80acbeb52fe156f2b8359cd78b5","","","","","","Differential inhibition of cutaneous T-cell-mediated reactions and epidermal cell proliferation by cyclosporin A, FK-506, and rapamycin.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3396d4042b06a80acbeb52fe156f2b8359cd78b5","","1994"

Being part of the modern vaccine formulations, these compounds have contributed remarkably to the field of therapeutics. Despite the successful record maintained by these agents, the requirement of novel immunomodulators keeps increasing due to the increasing severity of diseases. Hence, research regarding the same holds great importance. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of immunomodulators in improving performance of various vaccines used for counteracting most threatening infectious diseases, mechanisms behind their action and criteria for development of novel immunomodulators. Expert opinion: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying immune response is a prerequisite for development of effective therapeutics as these are often exploited by pathogens for their own propagation. Keeping this in mind, the present research in the field of immunotherapy focuses on developing immunomodulators that would not only enhance the protection against pathogen, but also generate a long-term memory response. With the introduction of advanced formulations including combination of different kinds of immunomodulators, one can expect tremendous success in near future.","","","","09067241699436e829b9c05425ccb37deb184627","","","","","","The basics and advances of immunomodulators and antigen presentation: a key to development of potent memory response against pathogens","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09067241699436e829b9c05425ccb37deb184627","","2014"

We tested albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, metronidazole, and cyclosporine in mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and inoculated by the intraperitoneal route with 107 E. cuniculi spores. One week after experimental inoculation, the mice were treated with albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, metronidazole, and cyclosporine. Histological and morphometric analyses were performed to compare the treated groups. The state of immunosuppression was evaluated by phenotyping CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Nontreated mice showed acute disseminated and fatal encephalitozoonosis. The treatment with benzimidazoles significantly reduced infection until 30 days posttreatment (p.t.), but at 60 days p.t., the infection had recurred. Metronidazole decreased infection by a short time, and cyclosporine was not effective. All animals were immunosuppressed by all the experiments, as demonstrated by the low number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

"1090",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","SUMMARY Cyclosporin A (CsA) acts as a powerful immunosuppressant through its binding to the cytosolic isomerase, cyclophilin (CyP), forming a complex which inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. The drug is also selectively anti-parasitic but its mode of action remains unknown. The mouse tapeworm, Hymenolepis microstoma is sensitive to CsA, but the rat tapeworm, H. diminuta is not susceptible either in rats, mice or in vitro. Using these two tapeworm models, the uptake and binding of CsA were examined in relation to parasite cyclophilins. Uptake and compartmentalization of the drug were markedly different in the two species: H. microstoma takes up more drug than does H. diminuta and sequesters more drug into intracellular compartments. Characterization of cyclophilins using both CsA binding and isomerase activity assays reveals that H. microstoma possesses two cyclophilin isoforms (Mr 17700 and 21400) with isomerase activity that is inhibited by CsA.

"1092",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","SUMMARY Cyclosporin A (CsA), a cyclic undecapeptide with powerful properties of immunosuppression, acts on parasitic infections in laboratory animals in various ways. The outcome of drug administration in vivo varies with timing of treatment relative to infection, route of administration, dose and number of treatments applied. CsA is clearly antiparasitic against malaria, schistosomes, adult tapeworms, metacestodes and filarial nematodes. By contrast, it acts as an immunomodulator against trypanosomes and Giardia, by exacerbating infection; in the case ofLeishmania spp. the drug acts variously. In some other infections CsA acts both as an antiparasite drug and as an immunosuppressant (Toxoplasma, avian coccidiosis and gastrointestinal nematodes).","","","","7aba706f3f8285e635a3f33d1de55883d7ee78a7","","","","","","Cyclosporin A: antiparasite drug, modulator of the host-parasite relationship and immunosuppressant","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7aba706f3f8285e635a3f33d1de55883d7ee78a7","","1992"

"1095",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","It is occasionally essential to surgically remove the damaged eye of the patient in the case of serious oculoorbital injuries, intraocular cancers, and other life-threatening diseases. An orbital implant is placed into the anophthalmic socket after the eye is removed to provide adequate volume reinstatement and revamp the cosmetic look of a normal eye. In the previous few decades, implant design and material selection criteria have progressed from basic nonporous polymeric spheres to devices with more complicated shapes and functions to ensure improved long-term clinical results. Because of their highly interconnected porous design, ceramic and polymeric porous implants have found popularity as a passive framework for fibrovascular ingrowth, with lower obstacle rates and the option of setting to improve prosthetic eye mobility. These materials, however, are not without flaws. The danger of migration and extrusion, infections after surgery, and poor motility transferred to the cosmetic ocular prosthesis are important elements of orbital implants of today. As a result, the development of novel biomaterials with improved functionalities (i.e., antibacterial effect, angiogenesis, and in situ moldability) that allow better eye replacement is more desirable than ever, highlighting one of the most challenging aspects of research topics in the field of ocular implants. This study highlights the history of orbital implants. It gives an outline of current advancements in the area, over and above some essential observations for materials design, selection, characterization, and transformation to clinical applications.","","","","eaedb7ed1c3cc043e31d15f9c6ae49dd28daa8de","","","","","","The Evolution of Orbital Implants and Current Breakthroughs in Material Design, Selection, Characterization, and Clinical Use","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eaedb7ed1c3cc043e31d15f9c6ae49dd28daa8de","","2022"

"1097",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Eine adäquate Versorgung mit einer optisch ansprechenden Augenprothese nach dem Verlust eines Auges ist nicht nur aus rein kosmetischen Gründen essenziell, sondern erleichtert vor allem eine gute soziale und psychische Rehabilitation. Fragestellung Es soll eine Übersicht über den aktuellen Stand der augenprothetischen Versorgung in Deutschland erstellt werden. Dabei wird auf die neuesten klinischen Erkenntnisse, die Handhabung der Augenprothesen sowie auf typische Komplikationen und psychologische Fragestellungen, mit denen Augenärzte im Alltag konfrontiert werden, eingegangen. Methoden Der Beitrag bietet eigene klinische Ergebnisse und eine aktuelle Literaturübersicht aus PubMed. Ergebnisse Enukleierte Patienten werden in Deutschland meist mit doppelwandigen, hohlen Prothesen aus Kryolithglas versorgt, Patienten mit einem Mikrophthalmus oder einem phthitischen Auge dagegen mit einer einwandigen, dünnen Bulbusschale. Patienten, die Augenprothesen aus Kryolithglas tragen, scheinen sowohl mit ihrem Aussehen als auch mit der Optik der Prothese zufriedener zu sein als PMMA-Augenprothesenträger (PMMA: Polymethylmethacrylat). Glasprothesen müssen mindestens jährlich erneuert, Kunststoffprothesen einmal pro Jahr poliert und alle 5 Jahre ersetzt werden. Bei Kindern, insbesondere in Wachstumsphasen, sollte mindestens halbjährlich die Passform der Prothese kontrolliert werden. Eine leicht höhere Bruchgefahr der Augenprothesen aus Kryolithglas stellt im Alltag für die meisten Patienten keinen größeren Nachteil dar. Okularisten und Ophthalmologen sollten zusammen mit dem Patienten ein individuelles Reinigungsprozedere festlegen, das sowohl vom Prothesenmaterial als auch von äußeren Faktoren abhängt. Komplikationen wie die allergische, die gigantopapilläre, die virale und die bakterielle Konjunktivitis oder auch die Blepharoconjunctivitis sicca müssen frühzeitig erkannt und therapiert werden, um die Prothesenfähigkeit zu erhalten. Bei entzündungsbedingtem Schrumpfungen des Bindehautsackes oder beim Post-Enukleations-Socket-Syndrom muss die Prothesenfähigkeit chirurgisch wiederhergestellt werden. Da die Gesundheit des verbliebenen, sehenden Auges die größte psychologische Belastung von Augenprothesenträgern darstellt, ist eine gute augenärztliche Betreuung, Für- und Vorsorge nach der Exstirpation eines Auges essenziell. Schlussfolgerungen Eine reibungslose augenprothetische Versorgung, eine adäquate und frühzeitige Therapie möglicher Komplikationen sowie die Berücksichtigung psychologischer Aspekte sind maßgeblich, um Patienten nach dem Verlust eines Auges dauerhaft erfolgreich zu rehabilitieren.","","","","7050522b84117b608f9b21d52ef62b137ba664cd","","","","","","Augenprothetische Rehabilitation in Deutschland heute – Versorgungsmöglichkeiten, Handhabung, Komplikationen und psychologische Aspekte","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7050522b84117b608f9b21d52ef62b137ba664cd","","2018"
"1098",":Paper","CC-BY","Purpose: To compare the exposure rate of wrapped hydroxyapatite versus unwrapped porous polyethylene orbital implants in enucleated patients. Methods: Medical records of the patients who underwent primary placement of hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye) or porous polyethylene (Medpor) orbital implants after enucleation between 2002 and 2005 in Farabi Eye Hospital were reviewed, and the occurrence of implant exposure during follow-up visits was recorded. The exclusion criteria were secondary implantation, evisceration, or follow up of less than 1 year unless the exposure had occurred in the year after surgery. In the hydroxyapatite group, the implants were wrapped either in Mersilene mesh (65%) or in donor sclera (35%). Wrapping was not performed for any patient in the porous polyethylene group. Results: A total of 198 cases with hydroxyapatite and 53 cases with porous polyethylene implant were identified. The most common causes of enucleation in both groups were globe trauma and painful blind eye. Rate of exposure was significantly higher [odds ratio (OR) = 7.97, p < 0.001] in patients with porous polyethylene (34.0%) than in those with hydroxyapatite implant (6.1%). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. Mean time of exposure after surgery was significantly (p < 0.001) longer in patients with porous polyethylene implant. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted a significantly (p < 0.001) higher rate of exposure in patients with porous polyethylene implant during the follow-up time. Conclusion: Unwrapped porous polyethylene implants demonstrated a higher rate of exposure, and longer time interval to exposure, compared with wrapped hydroxyapatite implants.","","","","710aeafed644c8f87dd93b51063f399fe052c8ec","","","","","","Comparison of the Exposure Rate of Wrapped Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye) Versus Unwrapped Porous Polyethylene (Medpor) Orbital Implants in Enucleated Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/710aeafed644c8f87dd93b51063f399fe052c8ec","","2011"

"1101",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Purpose: To inform patients and physicians of the complications associated with three commonly used orbital implants, as well as associated anophthalmic socket issues. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 542 patients who underwent eviscerations, enucleations and secondary procedures by one surgeon (Dr. James Oestreicher) was completed, paying special attention to complications in the follow-up period prior to pegging, as well as those that occurred post-pegging. Results: Approximately 60% of patients experienced complications prior to implant drilling, with discharge being the most prevalent (15.9%). Secondary procedures were associated with significantly greater complication rates prior to implant drilling. Silicone implants had significantly less pre-pegging pyogenic granuloma (P = 0.011) and hypo-ophthalmos (P = 0.042) than the other implant types. Seven implants had to be removed due to exposure. Implant drilling and peg placement were performed in 275 patients. Implant drilling complications were experienced by 67.4% of pegged patients, with a change in discharge from prior to pegging (27.2%) being the most prevalent. Plastic peg systems had a significantly higher incidence of complications than titanium systems. Conclusions: The majority of orbital implantations involve complications, these being largely minor ones which resolve spontaneously or are easily treated. Secondary implant procedures involve a higher likelihood of complications. Silicone implants have the smallest amount of complications. Should patients decide to undergo pegging, evidence sides strongly for the use of a titanium peg and sleeve system over the other peg types. Implant removal is a rare event; occurring in 1.3% (n = 7) of the study population.","","","","f6a596ad597b6a92b8e9e7ae2ec076388aaf2753","","","","","","Complications of Orbital Implants: A Review of 542 Patients Who Have Undergone Orbital Implantation and 275 Subsequent Peg Placements","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6a596ad597b6a92b8e9e7ae2ec076388aaf2753","","2007"

"1104",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Orbital implant materials have evolved greatly over the past century and include but are not limited to metal, ceramic, polymer, silicone, and glass. Knowledge of historically used materials is clinically relevant to patient care as certain materials carry a greater risk of migration, extrusion, infection, and limitations for imaging modalities utilized to visualize adjacent structures. We report an unusual case of an 80-year-old male who presented to our community hospital with seizure-like activity. CT imaging of the brain revealed several white matter and cortex lesions with the largest lesion measuring 2.5 × 2 × 1.9 cm. The patient had a history of enucleation with placement of an orbital implant following a penetrating injury to the left eye at four years of age. Hounsfield scale analysis was read by radiology as being most consistent with a thin metallic shell surrounding the orbital implant. The potential for metallic material was consistent with the implant’s age and time of placement. Few reviews on ocular implant materials from this period exist in the current medical literature. A single case report discussing a hollow metal orbital implant with similar-appearing imaging was identified. Due to concern for possible metal implant materials, the patient underwent implant exchange so MRI imaging could safely be performed. Intraoperatively, the implant was identified as a clear, hollow, non-metallic, non-porous polymer sphere. Following surgery, the patient was able to undergo appropriate neuroimaging with subsequent diagnostic biopsy. Current literature reviewing CT or photographic imaging of ocular implant devices prior to the 1940s is limited. This case highlights the importance of detailing materials historically used in orbital implants, their effects on clinical decision-making, and the utility of Hounsfield scale values to identify a material’s radiodensity on CT imaging.","","","","435743905e1a95e28578c7d2c4ef9ea49d116be3","","","","","","An Orbital Mystery: A Unique Case of an Obsolete Orbital Implant With a Review of Orbital Implant Materials","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/435743905e1a95e28578c7d2c4ef9ea49d116be3","","2022"
"1105",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","The axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) pass through the optic nerve head (ONH) and form the optic nerve (ON). The ONH serves as an anatomical interface between the vitreous cavity and subarachnoid space. After inducing acute neuroinflammation by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we observed inflammatory activation in the retina, but detect no signs of inflammation in the posterior ON or infiltration of inflammatory cells in the ONH. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ONH functions as a barrier to vitreous inflammation. Using transmission electron microscopy, we identified significant increase in G-ratio in the posterior ON on day 7 post intravitreal injection (PII) of LPS compared with the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group. Moreover, using confocal imaging of ex vivo tissue extracted from Aldh1L1-eGFP reporter mice, we observed that the ONH astrocytes altered their spatial orientation by elongating their morphology along the axonal axis of RGCs in LPS- versus PBS-treated eyes; this was quantified by the ratio of longitudinal (DL) and transverse (DT) diameter of astrocytes and the proportion of longitudinally locating astrocytes. Supportive evidences were further provided by transmission electron microscopic imaging in rat ONH. We further conducted RNA sequencing of ONH on day 1 PII and found LPS induced clear upregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that astrocyte and microglia contributed prominently to the transcriptomic alterations in ONH. Here, we report that the vitreous infectious insults induce morphological changes of ONH astrocytes and transcriptomic alterations in the ONH. Glial responses in the ONH may defend against vitreous infectious insults and serve as a barrier to inflammation for the central nervous system.","","","","553f9664b82a7b14f1b8b05e079106e6f3dc1bcd","","","","","","Optic nerve head: A gatekeeper for vitreous infectious insults?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553f9664b82a7b14f1b8b05e079106e6f3dc1bcd","","2022"

To retrospectively compare postoperative outcomes after primary enucleation and placement of a hydroxyapatite (HA) implant without wrapping, wrapped with auricular cartilage or donor sclera.


METHODS
Medical records of patients presented as intraocular tumor or severe ocular injury were identified from the electronic medical record system. Cases underwent enucleation and HA orbital implantation were enrolled in this study and were divided into 3 groups according to the wrapping material of HA implant. Cases with autogenous cartilage caps were enrolled in group A (n=11), with donor sclera caps in group B (n=12), and without any wrapping material in group C (n=9). Follow-ups were set at 1, 2wk, 1, 3, 6, and 12mo after surgery.


RESULTS
Altogether 32 cases finished the follow-up and were enrolled in this study. Three cases (27.27%) in group A, 4 cases (33.33%) in group B, and 4 cases (44.44%) in group C developed one complication each after surgery. In group A, no HA exposure occurred, but conjunctival inclusion cyst occurred in one and severe conjunctive chemosis in two cases. In group B, one HA exposure occurred, conjunctive inclusion cysts occurred in one, severe conjunctive chemosis occurred in one, and conjunctival granuloma occurred in one case. In group C, one HA exposure occurred, severe conjunctive chemosis occurred in two cases, and conjunctival granuloma occurred in one case. The case of exposure of none-wrapped implant was noted in the first 6mo after placement of the orbital implant. The case of exposure of donor sclera-wrapped implant was noted at the 12mo after placement of the orbital implant. Both exposure cases were treated successfully with conservative treatment.


CONCLUSION
With low incidence of implant exposure and mild complications, auricular cartilage can be a good choice of alternative wrapping material of orbit implant with satisfied outcome.","","","","1ba313fca74ca448e8a08761e277eb07c5ea94b5","","","","","","Auricular cartilage versus donor sclera as a wrapping of hydroxyapatite orbital implants.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ba313fca74ca448e8a08761e277eb07c5ea94b5","","2021"

Methods This was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study, in which demographic and clinical data were compiled by reviewing the clinical records of anophthalmic patients with implant exposure treated with an autogenous retroauricular myoperiosteal graft at the Instituto de Microcirugía Ocular (IMO, Barcelona, Spain) over the period January 2007 to December 2017. Main outcome was the long-term coverage of implant after retroauricular myoperiosteal autograft; secondary outcome was the rate of post-surgical complications and management. Results Over the 11-year period, 27 eyes of 27 patients with implant exposure received a retroauricular myoperiosteal autograft. Mean participant age was 47.3 ± 17.9 years (range 9–78, median 45). Primary surgery was enucleation in 8 eyes (29.6%) and evisceration in 19 (70.4%). Implant materials were porous polyethylene in 17 (63%), hydroxyapatite in 3 (11.1%), and bioceramics in 4 (14.8%). In the remaining three patients (11.1%), the implant material and size were unknown. Implant exposure was diagnosed after a mean of 98 ± 111.7 months. Mean exposure diameter was 5.9 ± 3.1 mm.

"1114",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","PURPOSE
To report surgical site infection (SSI) rates of eviscerations and enucleations with implants performed without perioperative intravenous (IV) antibiotics or postoperative oral antibiotics, and to give SSI prevention recommendations.


METHODS
A single-center retrospective chart review was performed after obtaining institutional review board approval. Charts were found by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Demographics, surgical indication, procedure, implant, antibiotic use, and postoperative course were recorded. SSIs occurring within 30 days after surgery were reviewed and postoperative infection rates were determined.


RESULTS
Four hundred eighty-one cases from January 1999 to December 2015 were analyzed. There were 102 eviscerations with implants, 314 enucleations with implants, 23 enucleations without implants, 23 implant exchanges, 15 implants placed secondarily after enucleation, and 4 implant removals. Seventy cases (14.6%) were given perioperative IV antibiotics, and in this group one periorbital infection occurred unrelated to orbital surgery (1.4%). Of the 411 cases (85.4%) not given perioperative IV antibiotics, 1 of 87 eviscerations with implants developed an SSI (1.1%), 2 of 273 enucleations with implants developed SSIs (0.7%), and none of the 13 enucleations without implants developed SSIs.


CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this is the first published case series reporting SSI rates of enucleations and eviscerations with implants performed without perioperative IV antibiotics or postoperative oral antibiotics. With infection rates comparing favorably to other case series where antibiotics were given, the routine use of perioperative IV antibiotics and postoperative oral antibiotics for enucleations and eviscerations may not be indicated.","","","","6f3dd4b4df55121844fc4292669706136606f14b","","","","","","Prophylactic Antibiotics for Enucleation and Evisceration: A Retrospective Study and Systematic Literature Review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f3dd4b4df55121844fc4292669706136606f14b","","2018"
"1115",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","BACKGROUND
Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.


MAIN RESULTS
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias.One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data.In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI -4.08 to -2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events.In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence).None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","","","","bacc98b84eac8de896d977fb426add2076d4e9f9","","","","","","Integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bacc98b84eac8de896d977fb426add2076d4e9f9","","2016"

Methods Retrospective case series. From 1994 to 2015, 256 patients who received primary implantation after enucleation or evisceration and were followed up for an average of 108.9 months were recruited. Detailed characteristics of patients, including previous surgery or trauma, surgical indications and methods, pegging procedure, and implant types were collected. The long-term outcomes were recorded. For patients with extensive implant exposure (diameter of tissue defect >2 cm), implant removal and dermis fat graft were performed. Results The risk factors for implant exposure included eviscerated globes and pegged implants. The exposure rates were higher (24.7% in hydroxyapatite (HA), 23.5% in bioceramic and 76.5% in Medpor) as compared with those in previous reports. The average times to exposure were 67.4 months in HA, 52.5 months in bioceramic and 73.4 months in Medpor implants. Among the cases with implant exposure, late exposure (>2 years after operation) accounted for 67% of cases. Thirty eyes with large-area exposure were managed with dermis fat grafts. Twenty-four cases were successfully treated with single surgery. The other six cases developed fornix loss and required additional reconstruction with full thickness skin graft. Conclusions Late exposures of porous orbital implants were noted during long-term follow-up. The causes of implant exposure may be associated with pegging procedures and evisceration. The implantation of dermis fat can be an effective procedure for the management of large-area implant exposure.","","","","e6054413639b605f9c2d13936f2e8211ae15d0a3","","","","","","Long-term complications of different porous orbital implants: a 21-year review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e6054413639b605f9c2d13936f2e8211ae15d0a3","","2016"

MEDPOR (Porex Surgical, Inc., Fairburn, GA, USA), OCULFIT I, and OCULFIT II (AJL Ophthalmic S.A., Vitoria, Spain) implants were implanted in eviscerated rabbis. Animals were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 4 each) according to the 3 implant materials tested and 2 follow-up times of 90 or 180 days. Signs of regional pain and presence of eyelid swelling, conjunctival hyperemia, and amount of exudate were semiquantitatively evaluated. After animals sacrifice, the implants and surrounding ocular tissues were processed for histological staining and polarized light evaluation. Statistical study was performed by ANOVA and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results. No statistically significant differences in regional pain, eyelid swelling, or conjunctival hyperemia were shown between implants and/or time points evaluated. However, amount of exudate differed, with OCULFIT I causing the smallest amount. No remarkable clinical complications were observed. Histological findings were similar in all three types of implants and agree with minor inflammatory response. Conclusions. OCULFIT ophthalmic tolerance and biocompatibility in rabbits were comparable to the clinically used MEDPOR. Clinical studies are needed to determine if OCULFIT is superior to the orbital implants commercially available.","","","","0b5874b0577357a6428e8492f4d6479effa20cdd","","","","","","Safety and Biocompatibility of a New High-Density Polyethylene-Based Spherical Integrated Porous Orbital Implant: An Experimental Study in Rabbits","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b5874b0577357a6428e8492f4d6479effa20cdd","","2015"

Methods: A retrospective review was performed on clinical records of patients ⩽18 years of age , managed with enucleation and HA implant placement. Recorded outcomes included implant-related complications, implant and prosthesis motility, and patient cosmetic satisfaction. Results: There were 525 children (531 sockets) with HA implant following enucleation. The mean age at HA implant placement was 3 years (median, 2 years; range, 4 days to 17 years). Indications for enucleation included retinoblastoma (n = 457, 86%), uveal melanoma (n = 17, 3%), medulloepithelioma (n = 8, 2%), and others (n = 49, 9%). The HA implant was uncoated (n = 370, 70%) or polymer coated (n = 161, 30%). For the 370 uncoated implants, wrapping was provided with scleral (n = 346, 94%) or bovine pericardium (n = 1, <1%), and 23 patients (6%) had no wrapping. The extraocular muscles were attached to the implant/polymer coat/wrap (n = 531, 100%), by suturing 4 rectus muscles (n = 349, 66%) or all 6 muscles (n = 182, 34%). Over mean follow up of 60 months, in 477 orbital implants, complications included conjunctival thinning (n = 10, 2%), implant infection (n = 6, 1%), implant exposure (n = 13, 3%), and implant migration/extrusion (n = 0, 0%). Motility for implant was judged as excellent (n = 245, 78%) and small-angle prosthesis motility was excellent (n = 196, 59%). Patient/family satisfaction with cosmetic outcome was rated as excellent in 471 implants (99%). Conclusions: Following enucleation in children, long-term outcomes of the HA orbital implant are excellent with favorable patient cosmetic satisfaction and rare complication.","","","","1e71db7f4291ab03f75b2b4e0153ebe4f87c52e6","","","","","","Hydroxyapatite Orbital Implant in Children Following Enucleation: Analysis of 531 Sockets","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e71db7f4291ab03f75b2b4e0153ebe4f87c52e6","","2015"

"1122",":Paper","CC-BY","Purpose: To determine the exposure rate after enucleation using the smooth surface tunnel (SST) and SST-EZ porous polyethylene (PP) orbital implants (Stryker Kalamazoo, MI, U.S.A.). Methods: The authors performed an institutional review board–approved retrospective review of 150 consecutively placed SST and SST-EZ PP implants after enucleation. Patient records were reviewed for comorbidities, surgical details, follow-up length, and presence of implant exposure. All prior published studies on porous orbital implant insertion were reviewed, and the exposure rate for patients undergoing enucleation with primary implant insertion was studied for comparison. Results: Of the 150 implants, 30 were excluded due to follow up of less than 8 weeks. Of the remaining 120 implants, 4 (3.3%) became exposed during the follow-up period (mean, 2.1 years), 2 of which were in children who underwent chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. The authors calculated a 7.1% exposure rate for all porous implant materials placed primarily after enucleation from 58 previously published studies. Conclusions: The SST and SST-EZ PP implants are well tolerated when placed at the time of enucleation. The theoretical advantage of a smooth anterior surface may indeed lead to a lower rate of exposure compared with standard unwrapped porous materials as demonstrated by the relatively low exposure rate using this implant.","","","","77dbe734572c7b0776d8c88b94e214495dea6c79","","","","","","Exposure Rate of Smooth Surface Tunnel Porous Polyethylene Implants After Enucleation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77dbe734572c7b0776d8c88b94e214495dea6c79","","2014"

"1128",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Abstract Purpose: To compare variables and outcomes from ocular trauma leading to either enucleation or evisceration to better inform surgical decision making. Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: We reviewed 441 patients between 2001 and 2012 presenting with ocular trauma to a Level 1 trauma center in Queens, New York; of these, there were 16 enucleations and 6 eviscerations. Retrospective chart review noted age, gender, mechanism of injury, initial and final visual acuity, time to surgery, length of follow-up, pain, degree of motility, and complications. A review of literature in the context of our study was performed. Results: 20 patients were male and 2 patients were female; average age was 44 (SD: 20.0, range 18–91). 9/16 patients were enucleated to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia, whereas only 1/5 patient was eviscerated for this indication (p = 0.1619). No cases of sympathetic ophthalmia were reported over an average follow-up of 316 days. Average length of follow-up varied significantly between the two groups, with an average of 370.4 days (SD: 566.9, range 0–1870) for enucleated eyes and 172.7 days (SD: 146.3, range 0–422) for eviscerated eyes (p = 0.42). Medpor implants were preferred in eviscerations (5/6 eviscerations), whereas hydroxyapatite implants were preferred in enucleations (10/16 enucleations, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Surgical decision-making in ocular trauma is largely based on surgeon preference and experience, with minimal evidence in the literature to support either enucleation or evisceration. We recommend evisceration over enucleation in cases of reliable patient follow-up due to the low incidence of sympathetic ophthalmia.","","","","91a50d406e397133363528b4471f36c09d11db92","","","","","","Enucleation versus Evisceration in Ocular Trauma: A Retrospective Review and Study of Current Literature","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91a50d406e397133363528b4471f36c09d11db92","","2013"
"1129",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Various types of grafts have been traditionally used to restore damaged bones. In the late 1960s, a strong interest was raised in studying ceramics as potential bone grafts due to their biomechanical properties. A bit later, such synthetic biomaterials were called bioceramics. In principle, bioceramics can be prepared from diverse materials but this review is limited to calcium orthophosphate-based formulations only, which possess the specific advantages due to the chemical similarity to mammalian bones and teeth. During the past 40 years, there have been a number of important achievements in this field. Namely, after the initial development of bioceramics that was just tolerated in the physiological environment, an emphasis was shifted towards the formulations able to form direct chemical bonds with the adjacent bones. Afterwards, by the structural and compositional controls, it became possible to choose whether the calcium orthophosphate-based implants remain biologically stable once incorporated into the skeletal structure or whether they were resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of regenerative bioceramics was developed and such formulations became an integrated part of the tissue engineering approach. Now calcium orthophosphate scaffolds are designed to induce bone formation and vascularization. These scaffolds are often porous and harbor different biomolecules and/or cells. Therefore, current biomedical applications of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics include bone augmentations, artificial bone grafts, maxillofacial reconstruction, spinal fusion, periodontal disease repairs and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Perspective future applications comprise drug delivery and tissue engineering purposes because calcium orthophosphates appear to be promising carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and various types of cells.","","","","bc9bf93af746cbd31b7c7fd512eac56821a6e1a2","","","","","","Calcium Orthophosphate-Based Bioceramics","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc9bf93af746cbd31b7c7fd512eac56821a6e1a2","","2013"

Porous anophthalmic orbital implants are used widely. This study evaluates risk factors for porous anophthalmic orbital implant complications and compares complication rates of hydroxyapatite, porous polyethylene, and polyglactin mesh-wrapped aluminum oxide implants.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The records of 105 patients (110 eyes) who received porous anophthalmic orbital implants for any indication were reviewed retrospectively. Complications were recorded and correlated with potential risk factors, including implant material. All patient records were de-identified to protect privacy.


RESULTS
Porous polyethylene and aluminum oxide implants were associated with higher exposure rates (porous polyethylene: odds ratio 6.1 [1.29, 29.1]; aluminum oxide: odds ratio 6.0 [1.58, 23.1]; P = .004) and higher overall complication rates compared to hydroxyapatite implants.

"1133",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","To the Editor: We read with great interest the report by Tabatabaee et al. entitled “Comparison of the Exposure Rate of Wrapped Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye) Versus Unwrapped Porous Polyethylene (Medpor) Orbital Implants in Enucleated Patients.” The report insightfully outlines the difficulty in comparing the exposure rates of previous reports due to differing indications for surgery, the size of the implant placed, the presence of previous infection, and the variability among surgical techniques. However, based on our previous experience with unwrapped porous polyethylene (PP) orbital implants, we were surprised by the 34% exposure rate as outlined in the report. This is much higher than previous reports and certainly higher than what we have experienced in our own practice. In their discussion, the authors emphasize the difficulty in comparing exposure rates among different surgeons. However, the outcomes of 2 different surgeons are reported in this study. While their description of the surgical technique used for placement of both implants mirrors a classic textbook description of an enucleation, we are led to assume that the exact procedure is followed by both surgeons. They control for many variables in their study, but interestingly, they do not specify whether both oculoplastic surgeons (Z.T., A.K.) were using PP and hydroxyapatite implants or whether one surgeon was using one implant solely. This could possibly explain the high rate of exposure in relation to one surgeon’s technique. Sadiq et al. described 26 cases of each implant type placed by a single surgeon and reported only one exposure in each group. If both surgeons (Z.T., A.K.) in fact used each implant equally, then factors influencing the selection of the implant type would be helpful in comparing exposure rates. The follow-up duration as outlined by Tabatabaee et al. was 25.7 months for the PP implants with a mean time of 13.5 months for implant exposure to occur. Our exposure rate was 4.4%: 4 out of 91 patients who had unwrapped PP orbital implant following enucleation over a mean period of 10.4 months. While the authors point out the relatively shorter follow-up period of our article, based on their report, a number of patients had exposure of the implant within 10 months following surgery, making our follow-up period relevant for postoperative implant exposure to occur. Other studies in the literature had exposure rates of unwrapped PP orbital implants specifically following enucleation closer to our exposure rate but over a longer follow-up period. We are currently reviewing the 136 cases from our original case series plus subsequent cases in which an unwrapped PP was implanted following enucleation or evisceration. We will report the data when they are available. We do not anticipate that a significantly longer follow-up duration will reveal exposure rates that even approach the 34% reported in this article. We certainly welcome clarification of the points outlined above. The data presented in Tabatabaee’s important article could then be revisited and reanalyzed, which would contribute greatly to our current knowledge of the exposure rate of porous orbital implants following enucleation and to our understanding of appropriate orbital implant selection and improve the surgical techniques used for enucleation.","","","","22b7734b1b7e189d97944c7e90897fe60c3879b7","","","","","","Re: ""comparison of the exposure rate of wrapped hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye) versus unwrapped porous polyethylene (Medpor) orbital implants in enucleated patients"".","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22b7734b1b7e189d97944c7e90897fe60c3879b7","","2011"

To compare the clinical effects of the modified and conventional secondary hydroxyapatite orbital implantations.


METHODS
A total of 40 patients who had received eye enucleation were equally randomized into the modified and conventional groups. Twenty patients were treated by conventional method. The four rectus muscles were separated, and then an orbital implant wrapped with xenogenous sclera was implanted. Twenty patients were treated by modified method. An implant unwrapped with xenogenous sclera was directly implanted into the muscle pyramid. The operating time, costs, clinical effects, and complications of the two groups were compared.

The average operating time of the modified group was 20.5±5.6min, whereas that of the conventional group was 56.8±14.6min (P<0.01). The average cost of the modified group was 7 800±340RMB (1 274±55.6USD), whereas that of the conventional group was 9 800±660RMB (1 601±107.8USD) (P<0.01). The two groups did not show significant difference in orbital implant mobility or postoperative complications.


CONCLUSION
The modified secondary hydroxyapatite orbital implantation has advantages in operating time, surgery cost, and complication reducing. It is worthy for wide clinical application and further study.","","","","52c82f75c1b1baa94eadee645b58ba87fb435d88","","","","","","Comparative study of modified and conventional secondary hydroxyapatite orbital implantations.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52c82f75c1b1baa94eadee645b58ba87fb435d88","","2013"
"1137",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Purpose To investigate the analgesic effect and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) between the opioid fentanyl and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketorolac in patients who underwent eye amputation surgery. Methods Retrospective observational case series. Eighty-two patients underwent evisceration or enucleation surgery by one surgeon over a 2-year period. Fentanyl by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) at 20 µg/kg with 12 mg/kg ondansetron or intravenous ketorolac at 2 mg/kg/day was administered to patients at postoperative days 0, 1, and 2. The pain score was measured using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS). The incidence of severe nausea requiring anti-emetics and the incidence of vomiting were reviewed. Results The mean postoperative VAS in the fentanyl group was significantly lower than that in the ketorolac group on the day of operation for both types of surgery (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). At postoperative days 1 and 2, the mean VAS was not different between the two groups for either surgical type (p > 0.05 for both days). The mean VAS was significantly higher in eviscerated patients than in enucleated patients at postoperative days 0 and 1 in the fentanyl group (p = 0.023 and p = 0.016, respectively). However, this was not observed in the ketorolac group. The incidence of PONV was higher in the fentanyl group than in the ketorolac group, although this was not statistically significant for either surgical type (p > 0.05 for both groups). Conclusions Fentanyl was more effective as an analgesic than was ketorolac on the day of operation for both surgical types. There was no difference between the two analgesics on postoperative day 1. The analgesic effect of fentanyl in enucleated patients was significantly higher than in eviscerated patients at postoperative days 0 and 1. The use of fentanyl by IV-PCA was associated with greater PONV despite co-administration with anti-emetics, although this finding was not significant.","","","","9f8ac000b7dbc2c96891d7096639f065f413dfa5","","","","","","Comparison of Pain-relieving Effects of Fentanyl versus Ketorolac after Eye Amputation Surgery","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f8ac000b7dbc2c96891d7096639f065f413dfa5","","2013"

This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the features of the syndrome, based on literature review and authors’ clinical and surgical experience. An electronic database (PubMed,MEDLINE and Google Scholar) search of all articles written in English and non-English language with abstract translated to English on anophthalmic socket syndrome was performed. Data reviewed included demographics, presentations, investigations, management, complications and outcomes. Different types of orbital implants were evaluated; the management of implant exposure was examined; different orbital volume enhancement procedures such as secondary implantation, subperiosteal implants and the use of fillers in anophthalmic patients were described; the problems related to socket contraction were outlined; the treatment options for chronic anophthalmic socket pain and phantom eye syndrome were assessed; the most recent advances in the management of congenital anophthalmia were described. Current clinical evidence does not support a specific orbital implant; late exposure of porous implants may be due to pegging, which currently is seldom used; filler absorption in the orbit appears to be faster than in the dermis, and repeated treatments could be a potential source of inflammation; socket contraction results in significant functional and psychological disability, and management is challenging. Patients affected by anophthalmic socket pain and phantom eye syndrome need specific counseling. It is auspicable to use a standardized protocol to treat children affected by clinical congenital anophthalmia; dermis fat graft is a suitable option in these patients as it helps continued socket expansion. Dermis fat graft can also address the volume deficit in case of explantation of exposed implants and in contracted sockets in both children and adults. Appropriate clinical care is essential, as adequate prosthesis wearing improves the quality of life of anophthalmic patients.","","","","3e39ef28a35e21f442022ea6e7076b022c0f3ca0","","","","","","Anophthalmic Socket Syndrome: Prevalence, Impact and Management Strategies","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e39ef28a35e21f442022ea6e7076b022c0f3ca0","","2021"

Patients and Methods This study is a retrospective case series. Secondary orbital implant insertion was performed for 25 anophthalmic patients (25 eyes) who had experienced primary evisceration more than 10 years earlier. Under general anesthesia, secondary enucleation removing the contracted sclera, including the optic nerve, was performed, and diverse types of porous orbital implants were inserted. After surgery, changes in the socket and ocular prosthesis motility, and improvements in esthetic appearance were evaluated. Results For 24 of the 25 eyes, the patients were satisfied. In 17 eyes, ocular motility was higher than “fair” and showed improvement. Deep superior sulcus deformity was improved to “good” in 8 eyes, and enophthalmos was improved to “fair” in 15 eyes. Combined procedures to correct lid malposition and fornix contracture were successful, and these additional operations to correct the prolonged complications of anophthalmos might have reduced the frequency of implant exposure. Conclusions In older anophthalmic patients with considerable concomitant socket contracture and cosmetic concerns, secondary porous orbital implant insertion may improve esthetics and the motility of the ocular prosthesis.","","","","3615d5b21881e090817a0bac4eccad5d1a31040b","","","","","","Effects of Secondary Porous Orbital Implantation in Anophthalmic Sockets","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3615d5b21881e090817a0bac4eccad5d1a31040b","","2012"

This study reviews the recent advances in the management of acquired socket contracture. Recent findings For mild contracture, several recent studies describe the beneficial use of amniotic membrane as a substrate graft to allow the conjunctival epithelium to migrate and multiply. To correct moderately severe socket contracture, quilting sutures are typically used to ensure survival of mucous membrane grafts, which are required to provide adequate lining to the socket. In cases of severe socket contraction, irradiated sockets, and recurrent socket contraction, radial-free forearm flaps or a variety of other flaps in association with bone expansion osteotomies are on the rise.

"1141",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Purpose of review The introduction of porous orbital implants has modified the surgical approach towards the rehabilitation of the anophthalmic socket. Since then, many steps forward have been taken. The present study highlights the most recent advances in the treatment of anophthalmic socket on the basis of a review of the most relevant studies. Recent findings Current studies analysing the treatment of anophthalmic socket focus on the follow-up of a large series of orbital implants, the mechanism of extrusion of implants, the management of implant extrusion, and the treatment of contracted socket. Orbital volume augmentation with self-inflating expanders has been suggested as a useful technique to treat congenital anophthalmia, though custom-made conformers may produce similar results. Summary Implant materials and wrapping, surgical technique and treatment of lid malpositions associated with postenucleation socket syndrome are all factors affecting the rehabilitation of patients with anophthalmia. Current clinical evidence does not support porous implants with respect to nonporous implants. The treatment of congenital anophthalmia is directed through a simultaneous stimulation of both soft tissue and bony orbital growth. Further studies with extensive follow-ups are necessary as adverse effects may develop many years after socket surgery.","","","","61bad732fcdc719eadcdfae8a7172fcaa331117d","","","","","","Treatment of the anophthalmic socket","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61bad732fcdc719eadcdfae8a7172fcaa331117d","","2008"

Implant sizing was performed intra-operatively to place the largest implant without tension on the wound closure. Outcome measures included implant complications, prosthesis measurements, and incidence of a good aesthetic outcome. Good outcome was defined as <2 mm enophthalmos and grade 1 or less superior sulcus deformity with a custom ocular prosthesis. Results Eighteen hundred eyes of 1800 patients were included. The mean age at surgery was 36 ± 21 years (median 32 years). Implants used were poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in 1737 (97%) and porous polyethylene in 63 (3%) patients. Two-petal sclerotomy was performed in 1512 (88%) and four-petal sclerotomy in 165 (10%) patients. The mean diameter of the implant used was 19.35 ± 1.18 mm (median 20, range 10–22 mm). The implant extrusion rate was 3% (56) and implant displacement was seen in none. The mean prosthesis volume and thickness were 2.22 ± 0.67 ml (median 2, range 1–6.5 ml) and 6 ± 1 mm (median 6, range 2–9 mm). The mean difference in prosthesis projection on Hertel’s exophthalmometer was 0.28 ± 1 mm (median 0, range 0–1 mm). Good outcome was observed in 93%. The mean follow-up period was 351 ± 386 days (median 194). Conclusion Evisceration with empirically selected primary orbital implant placement is associated with minimal implant complications and gives a good aesthetic outcome in 93% of the patients.","","","","48cc28eb16146c34dfdd4b28d195693975318fa6","","","","","","Outcomes and complications of evisceration with primary implant: an electronic medical record driven analytics of 1800 cases","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48cc28eb16146c34dfdd4b28d195693975318fa6","","2021"
"1143",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Purpose: Anophthalmic sockets cause disfigurement that may result in emotional and social distress. The choice of procedure and implant is based upon the surgeon's experience. There remains no standardization of cosmetic result. We sought to identify quantifiable anatomical features and functional properties related to a successful cosmetic result in patients with ocular prosthesis and to determine correlations between self-reported and third-party assessment of cosmetic success. Methods: This was a prospective observational study, which included 107 adult patients (50.1% female; age 53.08 ± 18.64 years, range 18–89) with acquired anophthalmia following prosthesis fitting. Patients completed a self-assessment questionnaire on self-perception of body image and ocular properties. Three independent examiners assessed cosmetic score. Assessed variables included prosthesis movement, eyelid symmetry, prosthesis stability, and socket fullness. Results: The general cosmetic result was 8.1 ± 2.19 (on a predetermined scale of 1–10) as perceived by the patients and 7.2 ± 0.19 by the examiners. Interexaminer correlation was high for all variables (P < 0.05). A good cosmetic result was correlated with prosthesis movement (P = 0.02), eyelid symmetry (P = 0.001), and prosthesis stability (P = 0.01). Factors that correlated with a good cosmetic result on multivariate analysis were prosthesis movement (odds ratio [OR] 4.95, P = 0.004), eyelid symmetry (OR 4.51, P = 0.006), and socket fullness (OR 3.56, P = 0.005). No correlation was observed between patients' perceptions of the overall cosmetic result and those of the examiners. Conclusion: The cosmetic result of prosthesis use among anophthalmic patients is generally good, as perceived by both patients and examiners. Good eyelid position and symmetry, orbital fullness, and prosthesis motility were associated with a better cosmetic result.","","","","8fe061ed7ba98dad1e3902748b3fe30c5c26ac8b","","","","","","Assessing the results of anophthalmic prostheses","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fe061ed7ba98dad1e3902748b3fe30c5c26ac8b","","2021"

Currently, the evisceration method using silicone balls is useful in animals; however, it is not available to those with impaired cornea or severe ocular atrophy. Moreover, ocular implant and prostheses are not widely used because of the diversity in animal size and eye shape, and high manufacturing cost. Here, we produced low-cost and customized artificial eyes, including implant and prosthesis, using computer-aided design and three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. For 3D modeling, the size of the artificial eyes was optimized using B-mode ultrasonography. The design was exported to STL files, and then printed using polycaprolactone (PCL) for prosthesis and mixture of PCL and hydroxyapatite (HA) for ocular implant. The 3D printed artificial eyes could be produced in less than one and half hour. The prosthesis was painted using oil colors and biocompatible resin. Two types of eye removal surgery, including evisceration and enucleation, were performed using two beagle dogs, as a preliminary study. After the surgery, the dogs were clinically evaluated for 6 months and then histopathological evaluation of the implant was done. Ocular implant was biocompatible and host tissue ingrowth was induced after in vivo application. The custom-made prosthesis was cosmetically excellent. Although long-term clinical follow-up might be required, the use of 3D printed-customized artificial eyes may be beneficial for animals that need personalized artificial eye surgery.","","","","8c059a57d83029dd0e44d7a7136ae3cd923b6575","","","","","","Custom-made artificial eyes using 3D printing for dogs: A preliminary study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c059a57d83029dd0e44d7a7136ae3cd923b6575","","2020"

This study reports the outcomes of the use of autologous pericranium graft in association with a large primary or secondary orbital implant in patients with a contracted socket and large orbital volume deficit. Methods: This was a retrospective single-institution study. Participants were 13 patients with contracted socket, volume deficit, and insufficient conjunctiva to cover the new implant divided into two groups, A (n = 3) and B (n = 10), according to the baseline condition of the socket. Surgery was primary evisceration (group A only) and placement of a large orbital implant followed by an autologous pericranium graft over the implant (groups A and B). Results: Mean follow-up duration for the patient series was 9.5 months (range 9–24). Complete epithelialization of the pericranium graft was recorded at 47.3 days of follow-up (range 33–67). No cases of implant exposure or shrinkage were noted during follow-up. Main postoperative complications were conjunctival granuloma (five patients, 38.5%), conjunctival seroma (one patient, 7.7%). All patients were satisfied with the aesthetic outcome. Conclusion: Autologous pericranial graft was effective in reconstructing the contracted socket so that the anophthalmic socket could accommodate a larger or secondary orbital implant. The efficacy of this procedure needs to be confirmed in a larger patient series.","","","","91707e1fd733c23569d1e1aa03d415b23aeff31f","","","","","","Autologous pericranium grafts for large orbital implants","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91707e1fd733c23569d1e1aa03d415b23aeff31f","","2020"

"1147",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common ocular cancer, and it typically presents before the age of 5 years in over 90% of cases. In high resource countries, RB patients tend to survive and retain their sight. This is not the case in low-resource countries because of late presentation and delayed intervention arising mostly from sociocultural and socioeconomic challenges. RB has no gender or racial predilection; the incidence is estimated as 1:16,000–1:18,000 live-births or 11/1 million children under 5 years. Most of the world's RB cases are found in Asia and Africa while most RB treatment centres are in America and Europe. RB is easy to detect by caregivers as a glowing white 'cat eye reflex' at night or when captured on camera. Health workers at primary care level can detect RB in early life if red reflex test and/or squint (Hirschberg) tests are deployed as part of wellness checks done especially during routine immunisation and well-baby clinics in the first 24 months of life. In most cases of RB, biopsies for histological confirmation are not required for diagnosis and treatment decisions to be made. Clinical information, ophthalmic evaluation and imaging modalities are typically used. There have been significant changes in the management of RB using various treatment modalities such as enucleation with orbital implant, use of chemotherapy delivered through intravenous, intravitreal, periocular and intra-arterial routes and targeted treatment with laser, cryotherapy and brachytherapy. Algorithm for management and development of the national RB program within the context of a low-resource country is presented from review of data extracted from Mendeley library, PubMed library, Google Scholar and One Network; full-text articles were mostly retrieved through the American Academy of Ophthalmology.","","","","8e6b03c30df57206760478501c1f88dba27601a9","","","","","","Contemporary management of retinoblastoma in the context of a low-resource country","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e6b03c30df57206760478501c1f88dba27601a9","","2019"

Orbital tissues en bloc were removed leaving conjunctival lining only at the fornices. Simultaneously, the 22 mm silicone sphere was implanted deeply into the orbit and covered with the oversized dermis fat graft of 30 mm in height and 35 mm in length with 20 mm of the fat thickness. The graft was sutured to the residual forniceal conjunctiva with interrupted 6/0 absorbable sutures overlapping conjunctiva with the graft edge for 2 mm to facilitate the epithelization. Epithelization was completed in two months, leaving well-formed fornices with good fitting of the prosthesis. The key point of orbital socket reconstruction after extended enucleation is to restore conjunctival lining prior to volume. Thus, whenever facing a massive volume and conjunctival lining loss, simultaneous insertion of the 22 mm silicone sphere deep into the orbit combined with oversized dermis fat graft is, in our opinion, the method of choice. It proved to be safe and effective with favourable long-term results.","","","","af93375e2e647a6782fda686125d73d6b699af6c","","","","","","Single-Stage Orbital Socket Reconstruction Using the Oversized Dermis Fat Graft and the 22 mm Silicone Orbital Implant after an Extended Enucleation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af93375e2e647a6782fda686125d73d6b699af6c","","2018"

To compare the frequency of orbital implant exposure and extrusion following eye removal with a simplified closure technique, closing Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva in 1 layer versus the classic technique of closure in 2 separate layers.


METHODS
The authors conducted a retrospective case note review of patients who underwent evisceration or enucleation treated by 1 surgeon between 2001 and 2013. Between 2001 and 2004, Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva were closed in separate layers; after 2004, a simplified 1-layer closure following eye removal was used. The primary outcome parameters were presence or absence of implant exposure or extrusion.


RESULTS
One hundred fifty-seven patients who underwent evisceration and 172 patients who underwent enucleation were included. Following evisceration, 2.5% developed exposure or extrusion of the implant, this was 2.5% in the 1-layer closure technique and 2.7% in the 2-layer closure technique (p = 0.95). Following enucleation, 1.7% developed exposure or extrusion of the implant, this was 1.8% in the 1-layer closure technique and 1.7% in the 2-layer closure technique (p = 0.96). Overall implant exposure and extrusion was 2.1%, this was 2.2% in the 1-layer closure technique and 2.1% in the 2-layer closure technique (p = 0.96).

Conclusion: PP implants showed lower chance of exposure than bioceramic implant for anophthalmic socket reconstruction, although we cannot rule out the possibility of heterogeneity bias due to the nature and level of evidence of the included studies. Clinical trials are necessary to expand the knowledge of porous and nonporous orbital implants in the anophthalmic socket management.","","","","32b26be58aff870b09a712a9d598c8b2692cc3f5","","","","","","Porous and nonporous orbital implants for treating the anophthalmic socket: A meta-analysis of case series studies","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32b26be58aff870b09a712a9d598c8b2692cc3f5","","2016"

To investigate the original protopathy, direct indications, clinical characteristics, complications of orbit plants and visual conditions of eye enucleation/evisceration.


METHODS
A retrospective study of 573 eyes removed (573 inpatients) at Ophthalmology Department in a tertiary care center of China from January 1993 to December 2012 was completed.


RESULTS
Cases underwent removal of the eye accounted for 2.15% of total ophthalmology inpatients, whose annual frequency declined from 3.80% to 0.52%. There were 167 eyes (29.14%) being enucleated and 406 (70.86%) eviscerated. Annual proportion of evisceration rose from 16.67% in 1993 to 90.48% in later years. Trauma was the top one (65.62%) in original protopathies followed by neoplasm (13.44%) and ocular infections (5.76%). Phthisis bulbi (45.20%) was the most common direct indication, succeeded by malignant tumor (12.57%), loss/unreconstructed of intraocular tissues due to trauma (11.00%), untreatable inflammation (9.60%), intractable glaucoma (8.55%) and sclerocorneal staphyloma (5.24%). Exenteration was underwent in 20 (25.97%) cases (40% for recurrent carcinoma). Following evisceration, secondary prosthesis implantation was more and earlier, implant exposure occurred in less but earlier and infection and extraction/exchange of implants were more than those following enucleation. Male, phthisis bulbi, evisceration and secondary implantation meant lower risk of implant exposure; eyes removed within 24h following trauma was an independent risk factor. There were 14.37% of eyes with vision of light perception at least as been removed. In the residual contralateral eyes, low vision accounted 5.58% and blindness 3.14%.


CONCLUSION
Ocular trauma, tumor and infections were great threats to eyeball preservation. Early and effective controlling of any original protopathies was vital. Generally evisceration presented more superior and safe outcomes than enucleation did. Visual conditions of the sufferers should be focused on.","","","","99f943f869b6442a485edea4ee9abfddee23c41a","","","","","","Removal of the eye in a tertiary care center of China: a retrospective study on 573 cases in 20 years.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/99f943f869b6442a485edea4ee9abfddee23c41a","","2015"
"1157",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Purpose We present clinical results of the use of the multipurpose conical porous synthetic orbital implant (MCOI) in surgical procedures of evisceration, enucleation, and secondary enucleation in ophthalmology patients. Methods A retrospective review was performed of 59 eyes in which conical implants were used, including 36 cases of eviscerations, 11 enucleations, and 9 secondary enucleations. In all of the cases, the follow-up period was greater than six months between 2004 and 2013. The results focus on documenting surgical findings, as well as postoperative complications among patients. Results Superior sulcus deformities were found in six eyes (10.2% of conical implant patients), and two eyes received additional surgical interventions to correct the deformities (3.4%). Blepharoptosis was found in four eyes (6.8%), two of which received upper eyelid blepharoplasty (3.4%). Fornix shortening was reported in only one eye (1.7%). Forty-one eyes had a satisfactory cosmetic appearance after the final prosthetic fitting of conical implants (69.5%). The most frequent postoperative complication was orbital implant exposure, which seemed to occur when the preoperative status of the conjunctiva, Tenon's capsule, and sclera preservation were poor in the eyes of the patients. Conclusions There was a lower incidence of blepharoptosis and fornix shortening with the MCOI in comparison to spherical implants, while the incidence of orbital implant exposure was similar with the MCOI in comparison to other types of orbital implants. In addition, the MCOI may have advantages with respect to postoperative cosmetic outcomes.","","","","537e7de3dec4696b7857f76b696ca9a737338f71","","","","","","Long-term Surgical Outcomes of the Multi-purpose Conical Porous Synthetic Orbital Implant","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/537e7de3dec4696b7857f76b696ca9a737338f71","","2015"

"1159",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Aims To report the outcome of orbital implant removal and dermis fat graft (DFG) implantation in patients with chronic anophthalmic socket pain (ASP), in whom all detectable causes of pain had been ruled out and medical management had failed. Methods Retrospective, multicentre case series. A review of all cases undergoing orbital implant replacement with DFG between 2007 and 2013 was conducted at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC), USA, and St. Erik Eye Hospital, Sweden. Inclusion criteria included (1) chronic ASP >2 years and unresponsive to treatment, (2) absence of pathological or structural cause for pain established by socket examination and orbital imaging, and (3) minimum 12-month post-surgical follow-up. Results Six cases with chronic ASP were identified, four were post-enucleation and two were eviscerated at an average age of 45 years. The incidence of chronic ASP among enucleations at UIHC over a 6-year period was 0.7%. Indications for enucleation and evisceration included tumours and glaucoma. Intractable ASP had been present for an average of 11 years and persisted despite medical management. All patients were free of pain within 3 months of implant removal and DFG placement and remained pain free at an average 24 months following surgery. Conclusions Orbital implant replacement with DFG was effective at relieving chronic ASP, and pain resolution was sustained in all cases. This surgical intervention may be a useful management option for patients in whom all detectable causes of chronic pain have been excluded and have failed medical pain management.","","","","d0d84eb483da237978198960c3a363e259d16046","","","","","","Chronic anophthalmic socket pain treated by implant removal and dermis fat graft","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0d84eb483da237978198960c3a363e259d16046","","2015"
"1160",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Purpose: To evaluate, using MRI, the extent and pattern of fibrovascular ingrowth into Medpor implants after modified evisceration. Methods: Contrast T1-weighted images were performed in 21 patients within 1.5- to 69-month intervals after modified evisceration with primary Medpor implantation. In 6 patients, the images were obtained separately following 1- and 5-minute delays after contrast administration. Results: No grade I enhancement occurred in these series. Grade II was observed in 2 patients (9.09%), grade III in 8 patients (36.36%), grade IV in 9 patients (40.91%), and grade V in 3 patients (13.64%). Significant correlation existed between the grade of enhancement and the postevisceration interval (r = 0.483, p = 0.023 < 0.05). The images demonstrated an enhancement pattern that started at the unwrapped posterior pole and anterior location of rectus muscles with progressive centripetal vascularization toward the center of the implant. At the early stage of recovery, the fibrous connective tissue was thick in front of Medpor spheres. In the 5-minute delay images of 6 patients, 2 patients failed to exhibit further enhancement; 2 patients exhibited enlarged and homogeneous enhancement; and 2 patients revealed more intense enhancement patterns. The medical ethics committee of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center approved the study. Conclusions: Fibrovascular ingrowth into Medpor implants was satisfactory after the modified evisceration and correlated with the duration of the implants. The double layers of sclera effectively prevented the implant extrusion and exposure. The authors recommend waiting at least 5 minutes before obtaining MR images after contrast administration.","","","","d607bb57e1e30377444191fb67fda6e2f7f5f4f1","","","","","","Fibrovascular Ingrowth Into Porous Polyethylene Orbital Implants (Medpor) After Modified Evisceration","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d607bb57e1e30377444191fb67fda6e2f7f5f4f1","","2015"

To assess main indications, postoperative complications and clinicopathological correlation of ocular enucleation-evisceration.


METHODS
A total of 107 subjects who underwent enucleation and/or evisceration and received hydroxyapatite implants (Scleral wrap or mesh) were assessed. For each patient clinicopathological data was collected which included demographic information, clinical history, primary clinical diagnosis, main cause of ophthalmic surgery (traumatic, non-traumatic), type of surgical procedure (enucleation, evisceration) and pathological report. Patients' postoperative clinical visits were checked for procedure-related complications during first year after surgery.


RESULTS
ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN PATIENTS (MALE: 65.4%; mean age: 26y) underwent enucleation (n=100) or evisceration (n=7) due to traumatic (n=41) and non-traumatic (n=66) causes. Disfiguring painful blind eye was the most common indication of surgery (66.4%), followed by leukocoria (19.6%) and endophthalmitis (4.7%). The main types of injury included ﬁrecracker, trafﬁc and work accidents, and sharp object perforating injury. In 53 (80.3%) subjects in non-traumatic group the initial clinical diagnosis matched the histopathological results. Malignant tumors (retinoblastoma: 47.5%, malignant melanoma: 27.3%) were the most common pathological diagnoses followed by phthisis bulbi (25.8%). The most common procedure-related complications were major eye discharge (39.6%), and implant exposure and discharge (20.8%).


CONCLUSION
Trauma and malignant tumors are the leading causes of enucleation-evisceration. Despite developing new techniques and materials, enucleation is still associated with considerable postoperative complications.","","","","8212293dedff7daf6a9fa3af965f78a7d000fb29","","","","","","Enucleation and evisceration: indications, complications and clinicopathological correlations.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8212293dedff7daf6a9fa3af965f78a7d000fb29","","2014"
"1162",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Purpose: Unlike ptosis, upper eyelid retraction (ULR) is not a widely reported complication of the anophthalmic socket or post-enucleation socket syndrome (PESS). The clinical entity of post-enucleation ULR is investigated. Methods: 1) Two cases of post-enucleation ULR presenting to a specialist oculoplastic center (South Australian Institute of Ophthalmology, Adelaide, Australia) are described, 2) Single forced choice survey of 22 members of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeons regarding their clinical experience of ULR in anophthalmia, and 3) English literature review. Results: One case of ULR occurred less than 1 year and the other several decades following enucleation, both cases underwent eyelid surgery. Eighty-two percent of oculoplastic surgeons surveyed believe ULR is a rare and late (50%) complication of anophthalmia and 13.5% had never seen a case. Ninety-five percent indicated that ptosis is more common than retraction. A literature review supports the rarity of ULR in anophthalmia and a number of etiological factors are discussed. Conclusions: Upper eyelid retraction is a rare and often late complication of the anophthalmic socket. It occurs less commonly than ptosis as part of PESS, but increased recognition and reporting may improve the understanding of its true incidence and cause.","","","","ceca9c25ff4c24bd297064f99ec38ed3f5bef4ed","","","","","","Upper Eyelid Retraction in the Anophthalmic Socket: Review and Survey of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeons (ANZSOPS)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ceca9c25ff4c24bd297064f99ec38ed3f5bef4ed","","2014"

The purpose of this article is to describe the different reconstruction techniques for anophthalmic sockets. In preparing the anopthalmic socket for prosthesis fitting we have several options: dermis-fat graft with a very good biocompatibility, the Guthoff artificial implant, which provides better motility or the methyl methacrylate implant inside the muscle cone. Each option has advantages and disadvantages but the choice of technique should be adapted to the needs and expectations of the patient, taking into account both time and cost.","","","","ae2332ce441d95e63305f9ee7bb81e7f0d8ac85c","","","","","","The Anophthalmic Socket – Reconstruction Options","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae2332ce441d95e63305f9ee7bb81e7f0d8ac85c","","2014"

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 101 cases of evisceration, enucleation, or secondary implant surgery with placement of a bioceramic porous implant was conducted. Type of surgery, existence of a peg, peg system used, time of pegging, problems encountered before and after pegging, treatment methods, and final status were recorded. Results: Evisceration was performed on 74, enucleation on 16, and secondary implant surgery on 11 patients. The patients were observed for a mean of 68.4 months (3 months–12 years). Fifty-three of the 101 patients were pegged. Patients were pegged at a mean of 9.3 months (6–23 months). Hydroxyapatite-coated, titanium-sleeved, titanium pegs were used in 43 patients, and titanium peg and sleeve system was used in 10 patients. Major complications were exposure and infection. Three patients presented with early exposure and late exposure developed in 14 of pegged and 4 of unpegged patients. The difference in late-exposure rates between pegged and unpegged group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Implant infection developed in 9 of the pegged and in 1 of the unpegged patients. Implant exposure was noted in 6 of these 10 patients with infection. The difference in infection rates between the pegged and unpegged patients was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In 2 of the pegged patients, removal of bioceramic implant was required and after resolution of infection, another type of porous implant was implanted and repegged. The peg system was removed in 6 patients for the management of either exposure, infection, extrusion, hypermobility of sleeve, or peg falling out. Four patients were repegged. The time period between peg insertion and development of complications ranged from 15 days to 10 years. 86.8% of pegged patients were free of major complications and satisfied with the result at the last follow-up visit. Conclusion: Despite potential complications that can occur as late as 10 years, bioceramic porous implants yield satisfactory long-term results. Existence of a peg system appears to play a role in the increased rate of late-onset complications. Further investigations on new and safer pegging systems should be conducted.","","","","9824fd2be9a2efb62fabf0dbd438a21e3d4fd9e3","","","","","","Long-Term Outcomes of Pegged and Unpegged Bioceramic Orbital Implants","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9824fd2be9a2efb62fabf0dbd438a21e3d4fd9e3","","2012"
"1169",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","PURPOSE
To evaluate histologically the integration process of cellulose gel produced by Zoogloea sp when implanted into rabbits' eviscerated eyes.


METHODS
This experimental study employed 36 eyes of 18 rabbits subjected to evisceration of their right eyes. The sclerocorneal bag was sutured and filled with biopolymer from sugar cane in the gel state. All animals were clinically examined by biomicroscopy until the day of their sacrifice which occurred on the 7th, 30th, 60th, 90th, 120th, or 240th day. The eyeballs obtained, including the left eyes considered controls were sent for histopathological study by optical macroscopy and microscopy. Tissue staining techniques used included hematoxylin-eosin, Masson trichrome (with aniline), Gomori trichrome, Van Gienson, Picrosirius red, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS).


RESULTS
No clinical signs of infection, allergy, toxicity, or extrusion were observed throughout the experiment. The corneas were relatively preserved. Macroscopic examination revealed a decrease of ~ 8% in the volume of the bulbs implanted with the biopolymer. After cutting, the sclerocorneal bag was solid, compact, elastic, and resistant to traction, with a smooth and whitish surface, and showed no signs of necrosis or liquefaction. The episcleral tissues were somewhat hypertrophied. The histological preparations studied in different colors revealed an initial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, replaced by a fibroblastic response and proliferation of histiocytes, along with formation of giant cells. Few polymorphonuclearneutrophils and eosinophils were also found. Neovascularization and collagen deposition were present in all animals starting from day 30; although on the 240th day of the experiment the chronic inflammatory response, neovascularization and collagen deposition had not yet reached the center of the implant.


CONCLUSION
In this model, the cellulose gel produced by Zoogloea sp proved to be biocompatible and integrated into the orbits. Morphometric, immunohistochemical and biodegradability studies should be performed in the future.","","","","37047238e84eade5b559b7d24a3fe91a923b529c","","","","","","Use of a gel biopolymer for the treatment of eviscerated eyes: experimental model in rabbits.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37047238e84eade5b559b7d24a3fe91a923b529c","","2012"

One-stage replacement of complicated implants has been attractive for reducing operation times and preventing long-time appearance without artificial eye. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 1-stage replacement surgery of orbital implant. A total of 21 eyes in 21 cases with noninfectious complications, who failed conservative therapies and surgical repairs, were treated with 1-stage orbital implant replacement. After a detailed ophthalmic history was obtained and examinations performed, patients with apparent purulent secretion in conjunctival sac were excluded. The preexisting orbital implant was carefully removed, and a new hydroxyapatite sphere was implanted simultaneously. Wound healing status, prosthesis movement, and cosmetic features were evaluated and recorded after at least 6 months’ follow-up. Orbital implant exposure(16 cases) was the main indication of the replacement surgery; other causes included superior orbital area depression (2 cases), conjunctival fistula (1 case), orbital implant malposition (1 case), and the metal material of implant obstructing magnetic resonance imaging scan in 1 case. Eye-socket hollow was redressed in all cases immediately, and 95.23% cases (20/21) could wear an artificial eye and had a good cosmetic appearance, whereas conjunctival sac fistula reoccurred in 1 patient, and the implant was removed ultimately. Conjunctival sac constrictions occurred in 4 cases after operation and were treated by secondary conjunctival sac reconstruction 6 months later.

RESULTS
We received 75 answered questionnaires. Fifty-three per cent of the respondents frequently treat anophthalmic socket and use the 18 mm diameter polymethylmethacrylate sphere in the majority of the surgeries, mainly covered by sclera (92%). Only seven interviewees had used integrated implants with pegging procedure. Eighty-two per cent of the ophthalmologists use the dermolipid graft to reconstruct the anophthalmic socket. They also follow the patients bi-annually.

The patient was fitted with an orbital prosthesis and a satisfactory aesthetic result was achieved.","","","","b103c3e0d70d9db3fe07a008465d4c22bf7e2b3a","","","","","","Long-Term Follow-up of a Tessier Number 5 Facial Cleft","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b103c3e0d70d9db3fe07a008465d4c22bf7e2b3a","","2011"
"1175",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Purpose: To report patient outcomes after placement of porous polyethylene (PPE)/bioglass (BG) orbital implants for primary enucleation or secondary implantation. Design: Retrospective chart review in one surgeon's practice (J.D.N.). Methods: A chart review of all patients who underwent placement of PPE/BG orbital implants was performed. Data included patient's age, gender, surgical indication, prior ocular surgery, medical history, procedure performed, implant size, and postoperative complications. Results: PPE/BG implants were placed in 170 sockets. Seventy-seven patients were women, and 85 were men. One hundred forty patients underwent primary enucleation and placement of an implant, and 22 patients underwent secondary implantation. One hundred sixty-one patients did well after orbital implantation with a comfortable socket, quiet conjunctiva, and motility. Complications occurred in 9 patients (5.3%). Excessive discharge alone occurred in 2 patients (1.2%). Seven sockets undergoing primary enucleation and implant placement had implant exposure. One patient had an early exposure, and 6 had late exposures. All exposures were successfully treated with antibiotics or additional surgery. Secondary surgeries were required by some patients, but not due to implant complications, included ectropion repair in 5 patients (2.9%) and volume augmentation in 3 patients (1.7%). Conclusions: The PPE/BG orbital implant may be a useful implant for orbital reconstruction after primary enucleation or as a secondary implant.","","","","b7915f43ae605e0765d16eb6e232c962e966601f","","","","","","The Porous Polyethylene/Bioglass Spherical Orbital Implant: A Retrospective Study of 170 Cases","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7915f43ae605e0765d16eb6e232c962e966601f","","2011"
"1176",":Paper","CC-BY","D iabetes-induced vision loss is a massive health care problem in the United States and around the world. The problem is becoming worse with the increasing prevalence of obesity. By 2050, the number of Americans with diabetic retinopathy is projected to triple from 5.5 million to 16 million, and visionthreatening retinopathy is projected to increase from 1.2 million to 3.4 million. The only proven medical therapy for diabetic retinopathy is control of blood glucose level and blood pressure, so it is crucial for ophthalmologists to identify patients at risk. In many cases the “ABCs” (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level, blood pressure values, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] levels) are not communicated between ophthalmologists and other primary care physicians, so patient understanding of these risk factors is crucial for proper management. Do et al investigated awareness of HbA1c, but to our knowledge no study has assessed all 3 levels. Therefore, the rationale for this study is to determine the proportion of ophthalmology patients with diabetes who know personal and recommended ABCs of diabetes care.","","","","2a30b54986ad39ccbef4bac342c7517fbeceb3a8","","","","","","Ophthalmology patient knowledge of personal and recommended ABCs of diabetes care.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a30b54986ad39ccbef4bac342c7517fbeceb3a8","","2010"

Methods: This is a retrospective, clinical case series of 419 patients who received a bioceramic orbital implant. All patients who presented to five oculofacial surgeons (D.J., S.G., J.D., S.K., L.M.) from January 1, 2000, to June 1, 2007, who received a bioceramic orbital implant and had a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were included in this study. The authors analyzed age, gender, type of surgery, implant size, peg system, follow-up duration, time of pegging, and problems encountered. The data from the patients with greater than 3 months of follow-up with exposure of the bioceramic implant are detailed in this report. Results: There were 353 patients followed for 3 to 96 months with an average of 30 months of follow-up (median 23 months). Implant exposure occurred in 32/353 bioceramic implants (9.1%). Six of the 32 (19%) exposures occurred during the 90-day postoperative period (average 2.1 months). Twenty-six (81%) exposures occurred outside of the 90-day postoperative period (average 27.5 months, range 4–82 months). Conclusions: Implant exposures can occur anytime postimplant placement. This review discovered an implant exposure rate of 9.1%, with the majority of the exposures occurring after the postoperative follow-up period. Patients with porous orbital implants should be followed on a long-term basis to detect this complication.","","","","8d3023367456fd97e990ca85e922c331b5efb1a7","","","","","","The Bioceramic Implant: Evaluation of Implant Exposures in 419 Implants","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d3023367456fd97e990ca85e922c331b5efb1a7","","2010"

"1186",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Although the past few decades have shown an improvement in the survival and complication-free survival rates in patients with beta-thalassemia major and gene therapy is already at an advanced stage of experimentation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) continues to be the only effective and realistic approach to the cure of this chronic non-malignant disease. Historically, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings have been the preferred source of donor cells owing to superior outcomes compared with HSCT from other sources. Nowadays, the availability of an international network of voluntary stem cell donor registries and cord blood banks has significantly increased the odds of finding a suitable HLA matched donor. Stringent immunogenetic criteria for donor selection have made it possible to achieve overall survival (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS) rates comparable to those of sibling transplants. However, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains the most important complication in unrelated HSCT in thalassemia, leading to significant rates of morbidity and mortality for a chronic non-malignant disease. A careful immunogenetic assessment of donors and recipients makes it possible to individualize appropriate strategies for its prevention and management. This review provides an overview of recent insights about immunogenetic factors involved in GVHD, which seem to have a potential role in the outcome of transplantation for thalassemia.","","","","ec6be0821240c42097dca950a3acd1fcf917d052","","","","","","What Unrelated Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Thalassemia Taught us about Transplant Immunogenetics","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec6be0821240c42097dca950a3acd1fcf917d052","","2016"

The new Dutch guidelines for cardiac rehabilitation, published in 2004, can be helpful in identifying potential candidates for a programme. Physical training is often a component of the treatment, but psycho-social counselling and education targeted at reducing anxiety and uncertainty, accepting the heart disease and learning to cope with it, can be just as important as those aspects targeted at improving the physical condition. Cardiac rehabilitation that includes physical training is safe for patients with congenital heart disease, for patients who have undergone an ICD implantation and for patients with stable chronic heart failure, as long as the pretraining exercise test is given a guiding role in selecting the appropriate physical work load. Patients with stable chronic heart failure should continue their physical training in order to maintain its beneficial physical and psychological effects.","","","","894d65c71c4d49d83131afcaed2164802f27f43d","","","","","","[Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with a congenital heart disease, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or chronic heart failure].","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/894d65c71c4d49d83131afcaed2164802f27f43d","","2004"

"1189",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Abstract Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) class and physical activity and sedentary behavior in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Methods This study was a secondary analysis of the OPTICARE trial. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured in participants with ACS (n = 359) using actigraphy at baseline, directly after completion of a multidisciplinary 12-week exercise-based CR program and 9 months thereafter. Outcome measures were step count and duration of time (percentage of wear time) spent in light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Participants were classified as normal weight (BMI = 18.5–24.99 kg/m2; n = 82), overweight (BMI = 25.0–29.99 kg/m2; n = 182), or obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2; n = 95). Linear mixed-effects models were applied to study the relationship between BMI class and physical activity and sedentary behavior. Results At the start of CR, compared with participants with normal weight, participants with obesity made on average 1.11 steps fewer per minute (952 steps/d), spent 2.9% (25 min/d) less time in light physical activity, and spent 3.31% (28 min/d) more time in sedentary behavior. Participants of all BMI classes improved their physical activity and sedentary behavior levels similarly during CR, and these improvements were maintained after completion of CR. Conclusion Participants with ACS who had obesity started CR with a less favorable physical activity and sedentary behavior profile than that of participants with normal weight. Because all BMI classes showed similar improvement during CR, this deficit was preserved. Impact This study indicates that reconsideration of the CR program in the Netherlands for patients with ACS and obesity is warranted, and development of more inclusive interventions for specific populations is needed. A new program for people with obesity should include added counseling on increasing physical activity and preventing sedentary behavior to facilitate weight loss and reduce mortality risk. Lay Summary People with ACS who have obesity are less active and sit more than individuals with normal weight, both during and after CR. This study suggests that CR needs to be changed to help individuals increase their physical activity to help them lose weight and reduce their risk of death.","","","","4480adff791da44e224d1556d36d292640dcb2fc","","","","","","Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior in Cardiac Rehabilitation: Does Body Mass Index Matter?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4480adff791da44e224d1556d36d292640dcb2fc","","2021"
"1190",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background. Stable angina pectoris with moderate coronary artery lesions is a syndrome caused by coronary artery stenosis, which endangers the quality of life. Previous acupuncture studies have shown effectiveness as a complementary therapy for ischaemic heart disease. However, more clinical evidence is needed for verification, and the mechanism should be investigated, especially involving the functional interactions between the heart and brain. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial to provide more evidence for acupuncture efficacy and its mechanism in ischaemic heart disease. Methods/Design. A total of 80 participants will be randomized to the electroacupuncture group and sham-electroacupuncture group at a ratio of 1 : 1. This trial will be conducted over 8 weeks, including a 2-week screening, 2-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up. All participants will continue to receive similar basic disease treatment procedures before the trial (including lifestyle changes and treatment for standard supportive medications, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia, such as aspirin, metoprolol succinate, atorvastatin, and sodium fosinopril). Additionally, 12 sessions of acupuncture will be administered during the treatment period. The main outcome is Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. The other observation indices are the heart rate variability and self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale scores. To explore mechanisms based on the hypothesis of a correlation between heart and brain function, fMRI scans will be used to detect functional brain changes in 15 patients from each group at baseline and at the end of treatment. Finally, the efficacy of acupuncture will be evaluated, and the HRV and imaging data will be correlated with clinical data to investigate the possible relationships between the brain and heart activity. Discussion. This trial will provide evidence for acupuncture as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of stable angina pectoris with moderate coronary artery lesions. The results will shed light on potential mechanisms of heart-brain interactions underlying acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy for treating ischaemic heart disease.

"1192",":Paper","CC-BY","Aims
We aimed to assess the effects of a multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program on survival after treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).


Methods and results
Using propensity matching analysis, a total of 1159 patients undergoing CR were 1:1 matched with ACS patients who did not undergo CR and survived at least 60 days. The Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox regression analysis were applied to study differences in survival. During follow-up, a total of 335 (14.5%) patients had died. Cumulative mortality rates at 5 and 10 years were 6.4% and 14.7% after CR and 10.4% and 23.5% in the no CR group (P < 0.001). Cardiac rehabilitation patients had 39% lower mortality than non-CR controls [10-year mortality 14.7% vs. 23.5%; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.81]. A total of 915 (78.9%) patients completed CR and had 46% lower mortality than those who did not complete CR (10-year mortality 13.6% vs. 18.9%; adjusted HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42-0.70).


Conclusion
Patients who underwent pPCI for ACS, with a CR program had lower mortality than their non-CR counterparts. Mortality was particularly low in patients who completed the program. In conclusion, CR is still beneficial in terms of survival.","","","","2d5dce38e5b92fe1d5a21e33ece1b53e5b31940b","","","","","","Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with acute coronary syndrome with primary percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with improved 10-year survival","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d5dce38e5b92fe1d5a21e33ece1b53e5b31940b","","2018"
"1193",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Objective The OPTICARE (OPTImal CArdiac REhabilitation) randomised controlled trial compared two advanced and extended cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes to standard CR for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These programmes were designed to stimulate permanent adoption of a heart-healthy lifestyle. The primary outcome was the SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk function at 18 months follow-up. Methods In total, 914 patients with ACS (age, 57 years; 81% men) were randomised to: (1) 3 months standard CR (CR-only); (2) standard CR including three additional face-to-face active lifestyle counselling sessions and extended with three group fitness training and general lifestyle counselling sessions in the first 9 months after standard CR (CR+F); or (3) standard CR extended for 9 months with five to six telephone general lifestyle counselling sessions (CR+T). Results In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no difference in the SCORE risk function at 18 months between CR+F and CR-only (3.30% vs 3.47%; p=0.48), or CR+T and CR-only (3.02% vs 3.47%; p=0.39). In a per-protocol analysis, two of three modifiable SCORE parameters favoured CR+F over CR-only: current smoking (13.4% vs 21.3%; p<0.001) and total cholesterol (3.9 vs 4.3 mmol/L; p<0.001). The smoking rate was also lower in CR+T compared with the CR-only (12.9% vs 21.3%; p<0.05). Conclusions Extending CR with extra behavioural counselling (group sessions or individual telephone sessions) does not confer additional benefits with respect to SCORE parameters. Patients largely reach target levels for modifiable risk factors with few hospital readmissions already following standard CR.

"1203",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Ocular albinism type 1 (OA1) is caused by mutations in the GPR143 gene located at Xp22.2. The manifestations, which are due to hypopigmentation, are confined to the eyes and optic pathway. OA1 associated with late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss was previously reported in a single family and hypothesized to be caused by a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving GPR143 and the adjacent gene, TBL1X. Here, we report on a family with OA1, infertility, late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss, and a small interstitial Xp microdeletion including the GPR143, TBL1X, and SHROOM2 genes. In addition, we re‐examined a patient previously described with OA1, infertility and a similar Xp deletion with audiologic follow‐up showing a late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss. Our results raise an intriguing question about the possibility for TBL1X (absence) involvement in this type of hearing loss. However, our study cannot claim a causative relationship and more convincing evidence is needed before the hypothesis can be accepted that TBL1X could be involved in late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss and that ocular albinism with late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss can present itself as a contiguous gene deletion/microdeletion syndrome. The finding of infertility in all affected male patients demonstrates that this deletion, including the SHROOM2 gene, may be a potentially causative X‐linked genetic factor of male infertility.","","","","42827aff36ca001dea5ebee1058d116498f8dbb5","","","","","","Ocular albinism with infertility and late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42827aff36ca001dea5ebee1058d116498f8dbb5","","2018"

Methods The study was a non-randomised experimenter-masked prospective controlled observational study of individuals aged 6–18 years with progressing myopia but no ocular pathology. Participants were allocated, according to patient/parent choice, to receive 0.01% atropine eyedrops, DIMS (Hoya® MiyoSmart®) spectacles, combined atropine+DIMS or single vision spectacle lenses (control group). The key outcome variables, cycloplegic autorefraction spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and axial length (AL), were measured at baseline and after three, six, and 12 months. Results Of the 146 participants (mean age 10.3y ±3.2), 53 received atropine, 30 DIMS spectacles, 31 atropine+DIMS, and 32 single vision control spectacles. Generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed for SER, whilst controlling for age and SER at baseline, at each stage all treatment groups had significantly reduced progression compared with the control group (p<0.016). For AL, whilst controlling for baseline age and AL, at 6 and 12 months all treatment groups had significantly less progression than the control group (p<0.005). For SER only, in pairwise comparisons at 12 months the atropine+DIMS group had significantly reduced progression compared with the DIMS only and Atropine only groups (p<0.001). Conclusion In a European population, DIMS and atropine are effective at reducing myopia progression and axial elongation in progressing myopia and are most successful at reducing myopia progression when used in combination.","","","","a67bce031cab4116ff22315ce294b1a030fc4537","","","","","","A comparison of myopia control in European children and adolescents with defocus incorporated multiple segments (DIMS) spectacles, atropine, and combined DIMS/atropine","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a67bce031cab4116ff22315ce294b1a030fc4537","","2023"

To analyse the association of sleep quality with myopia under different genetic risk (GR) levels.


METHODS
A cross-sectional survey of students aged 9-14y in Wenzhou, China, was conducted. Refraction without cycloplegia and ocular parameters were measured. Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were replicated by association analysis and used to compute the GR score (GRS). Possible confounders were assessed by a questionnaire that collected information about the children and their parents. Generalized linear models were used to analyse the sleep quality, the GR, and their interaction effects on the risk of myopia.


RESULTS
Out of 1354 children included in this study, 353 (26.07%) had sleep disturbances. The GRS ranged from 4.49 to 12.89 with a mean of 7.74±1.23, and the participants were divided into a low GR group, a moderate GR group and a high GR group according to the GRS quartile. In the generalized linear model, the children with sleep disturbances and high GR had a higher risk of myopia than those without sleep disturbances and with low GR (OR=1.59, 95%CI: 1.12-2.25; OR=1.88, 95%CI: 1.23-2.88, respectively). Compared to those with low GR and SDs, children with high GR with or without SDs had a higher risk of myopia (OR=4.88, 95%CI: 2.03-11.71; OR=1.70, 95%CI: 1.06-2.72, respectively).


CONCLUSION
The prevalence of sleep disturbances in elementary school students in Wenzhou was 26.07%. There is a significant interaction between sleep disturbances and a high GR of myopia, suggesting that a high GR of myopia may increase children's sensitivity to sleep disturbances. This study indicates that children with a high GR of myopia need to achieve adequate sleep duration and excellent sleep quality.","","","","2a26f4298fe1bf32515aaa487818d1278e12d367","","","","","","Association of sleep quality with myopia based on different genetic risk levels.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a26f4298fe1bf32515aaa487818d1278e12d367","","2022"

Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases (with manual searching of reference lists of reviews). Studies included assessed changes in myopia-related outcomes (cycloplegic refraction) during COVID and pre-COVID. Of 367 articles identified, 7 (6 prospective cohorts; 1 repeated cross-sectional study) comprising 6327 participants aged 6 to 17 were included. Quality appraisals were performed with Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists. Pooled differences in annualized myopic shifts or mean spherical equivalent (SE) during COVID and pre-COVID were obtained from random-effects models. Results: In all 7 studies, SE moved toward a myopic direction during COVID (vs pre-COVID), where 5 reported significantly faster myopic shifts [difference in means of changes: −1.20 to −0.35 diopters per year, [D/y]; pooled estimate: −0.73 D/y; 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.96, −0.50; P<0.001], and 2 reported significantly more myopic SE (difference in means: −0.72 to −0.44 D/y; pooled estimate: −0.54 D/y; 95% CI: −0.80, −0.28; P<0.001). Three studies reported higher myopia (SE ≤−0.50 D) incidence (2.0- to 2.6-fold increase) during COVID versus pre-COVID. Of studies assessing lifestyle changes, all 4 reported lower time outdoors (pre-COVID vs during COVID: 1.1–1.8 vs 0.4–1.0 hours per day, [h/d]), and 3 reported higher screen time (pre-COVID vs during COVID: 0.7–2.8 vs 2.4–6.9 h/d). Conclusions: This review suggests more myopic SE shifts during COVID (vs pre-COVID) in participants aged 6 to 17. COVID-19 restrictions may have worsened SE shifts, and lifting of restrictions may lessen this effect. Evaluations of the long-term effects of the pandemic lifestyle on myopia onset and progression in large studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","","","","20edce6a80e24ea2cfd312f4b5bfa29210acdfd0","","","","","","Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic–Related Lifestyle on Myopia","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20edce6a80e24ea2cfd312f4b5bfa29210acdfd0","","2022"

The factors affecting women’s exposure to verbal and psychological violence by their husbands or partners in Turkey were determined using binary logistic and binary probit regression analyses. Women whose husbands or partners cheated and used alcohol were more exposed to verbal and psychological violence compared to others. In addition, women who were exposed to physical, economic, and sexual violence were more exposed to verbal and psychological violence compared to others. Exposure to violence by first-degree relatives increases the possibility of exposure to verbal and psychological violence. More effective results can be achieved by prioritizing women likelier to be exposed to violence in policies aimed at preventing acts of verbal violence against women in our country.

First, we designed and created realistic 3D models simulating three different urban scenes with varying degrees of exposure to alcohol in the environment. Second, we used a survey on 159 adults to explore the level of acceptance of, attitudes towards, and perceptions of alcohol exposure in each scene. Participants reported a higher level of comfort in the scene with null alcohol exposure compared with the other scenes (p < 0.001). Acceptance towards alcohol exposure decreased as the level of alcohol elements increased in the scenes (p < 0.01). Acceptance also decreased when children were present in the scenes (p < 0.01).

Cigarette butts on the ground then encourage people to drop theirs as well. We test this theory on benches of a university campus in a field experiment with two treatments: (1) a clean environment with no cigarette butts on the ground and (2) a dirty environment with 25 cigarette butts on the ground. Our outcome variable is the number of additional cigarette butts on the ground after two hours. We find a small effect of approximately 0.5 butts less per 2-hour period on clean grounds.

It can be attributed to one of the major features of natural evolution: its open-endedness, that can be considered as the ability to continuously produce novelty and/or complexity [1]. This feature is critical to allow an agent to continuously adapt to its environment. We propose here an extension of Quality Diversity algorithms to make it more open-ended. Quality Diversity algorithms aim at generating a large set of diverse solutions [3, 10]. They can be used in a two-steps process in which (1) a diverse set of solutions is generated offline before (2) the agent can exploit it online to find the behavior that fits to the situation [2, 4--6]. QD algorithms main goal is to fill a behavior space whose dimensions are defined by behavior descriptors. Current QD algorithms can generate novelty and complexity, but within the frame of these behavior descriptors. To make the evolutionary process more open-ended, we extend Cully and Demiris framework [3] and introduce Multi-Container Quality Diversity algorithms (MCQD). MCQD are QD algorithms relying on multiple behavior spaces that can be added on the fly. MCQD thus aims at implementing an open-ended evolutionary process that would explore any new behavior space that could be found of interest during the search process.","","","","62e6dbefef41f7ba77246a563948c44e22be5891","","","","","","Open-ended evolution with multi-containers QD","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62e6dbefef41f7ba77246a563948c44e22be5891","","2018"

No generic and autonomous method does exist to generate these movements without making hypotheses on the robot or on the object. Learning methods could help to autonomously discover relevant grasping movements, but they face an important issue: grasping movements are so rare that a learning method based on exploration has little chance to ever observe an interesting movement, thus creating a bootstrap issue. We introduce an approach to generate diverse grasping movements in order to solve this problem. The movements are generated in simulation, for particular object positions. We test it on several simulated robots: Baxter, Pepper and a Kuka Iiwa arm. Although we show that generated movements actually work on a real Baxter robot, the aim is to use this method to create a large dataset to bootstrap deep learning methods.","","","","b62313cd89c9f01e061b112c0899509de215cae6","","","","","","Automatic Acquisition of a Repertoire of Diverse Grasping Trajectories through Behavior Shaping and Novelty Search","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b62313cd89c9f01e061b112c0899509de215cae6","","2022"

They are specially adapted for multi-modal problems that can be solved in many different ways, such as complex reinforcement learning or robotics tasks. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the choice of feature descriptors (FDs) quantifying the similarity in behaviour of the solutions. While FDs usually needs to be hand-designed, recent studies have proposed ways to define them automatically by using feature extraction techniques, such as PCA or Auto-Encoders, to learn a representation of the problem from previously explored solutions. Here, we extend these approaches to more complex problems which cannot be efficiently explored by relying only on a single representation but require instead a set of diverse and complementary representations. We describe MC-AURORA, a Quality-Diversity approach that optimises simultaneously several collections of solutions, each with a different set of FDs, which are, in turn, defined automatically by an ensemble of modular auto-encoders. We show that this approach produces solutions that are more diverse than those produced by single-representation approaches.","","","","e4a8e06b213f32e6a1350c3fbf1ece8aca924a14","","","","","","Ensemble feature extraction for multi-container quality-diversity algorithms","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4a8e06b213f32e6a1350c3fbf1ece8aca924a14","","2021"

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), combined with physical simulators, represent a valid tool to overcome this issue. In this work, we investigate algorithmic solutions to improve the Quality Diversity of co-evolved designs of Tensegrity Soft Modular Robots (TSMRs) for two robotic tasks, namely goal reaching and squeezing trough a narrow passage. To this aim, we use three different EAs, i.e., MAP-Elites and two custom algorithms: one based on Viability Evolution (ViE) and NEAT (ViE-NEAT), the other named Double Map MAP-Elites (DM-ME) and devised to seek diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when considering diversity in terms of ""illumination"" of the feature space, DM-ME outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map.","","","","4f62d4c9b3abccb4c91886b64ffcf6203fee0074","","","","","","Seeking quality diversity in evolutionary co-design of morphology and control of soft tensegrity modular robots","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f62d4c9b3abccb4c91886b64ffcf6203fee0074","","2021"

To illuminate the elite solutions for a space of behaviors, QD algorithms require the definition of a suitable behavior space. If the behavior space is high-dimensional, a suitable dimensionality reduction technique is required to maintain a limited number of behavioral niches. While current methodologies for automated behavior spaces focus on changing the geometry of the behavior space or on unsupervised learning of its key features, there remains a need for customizing behavioral diversity to a particular meta-objective specified by the end user. In the newly emerging framework of QD Meta-Evolution, or QD-Meta for short, one evolves a population of QD algorithms, each with different algorithmic and representational characteristics, to optimize the algorithms and their resulting archives to a user-defined meta-objective.

Typical methods to solve it aim to reduce the search space by minimizing unwanted interactions through restrictions on the design (e.g. staples in DNA origami or voxel-based designs in DNA Bricks). Here, we present a novel methodology that aims to reduce this search space by identifying the relevant properties of a given assembly system to the emergence of various families of structures (e.g. simple structures, polymers, branched structures). For a given set of DNA strands, our approach automatically finds chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that generate sets of structures exhibiting ranges of specific user-specified properties, such as length and type of structures or their frequency of occurrence. For each set, we enumerate the possible DNA structures that can be generated through domain-level interactions, identify the most prevalent structures, find the best-performing sequence sets to the emergence of target structures, and assess CRNs' robustness to the removal of reaction pathways. Our results suggest a connection between the characteristics of DNA strands and the distribution of generated structure families.","","","","57ba578923047838f7a1d2842a29b0c34ce81317","","","","","","Automated exploration of DNA-based structure self-assembly networks","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57ba578923047838f7a1d2842a29b0c34ce81317","","2021"

Quality-diversity evolutionary approaches optimise for novelty as well as performance, and can be used to generate a repertoire of diverse designs. This design repertoire could be used as a tool to guide a designer and kick-start the rapid prototyping process. This paper explores this idea in the context of mechanical linkage based robots. These robots can be a good test-bed for rapid prototyping, as they can be modified quickly for swift iterations in design. We compare three evolutionary algorithms for optimising 2D mechanical linkages: 1) a standard evolutionary algorithm, 2) the multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II, and 3) the quality-diversity algorithm MAP-Elites. Some of the found linkages are then realized on a physical hexapod robot through a prototyping process, and tested on two different floors. We find that all the tested approaches, except the standard evolutionary algorithm, are capable of finding mechanical linkages that creates a path similar to a specified desired path. However, the quality-diversity approaches that had the length of the linkage as a behaviour descriptor were the most useful when prototyping. This was due to the quality-diversity approaches having a larger variety of similar designs to choose from, and because the search could be constrained by the behaviour descriptors to make linkages that were viable for construction on our hexapod platform.","","","","6d546819cbeaf03a0c53b47e713529f64d717be7","","","","","","Evolution of linkages for prototyping of linkage based robots","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d546819cbeaf03a0c53b47e713529f64d717be7","","2022"

DESCRIPTION A 59yearold man with a medical history of hypertension presented to the hospital with chest discomfort with swallowing and a feeling of food ‘getting stuck’ in his chest on swallowing solids. The patient had dyspnoea on exertion but denied any orthopnoea, dizziness, lower extremity swelling or palpitations. On physical examination, his blood pressure was significantly elevated to 250/130 mm Hg, and breath sounds were slightly diminished bilaterally on auscultation without any wheezing or crackles. On presentation, his troponin I was elevated to 4.65 ng/L (0.00–0.06 ng/L), which increased to 32.6 ng/L. ECG did not show any STsegment or Twave changes. CT of the neck with contrast showed a nonspecific narrowing of the supraglottic airway without any mass or fluid collection and a retrooesophageal/retrotracheal aberrant right subclavian artery (figure 1). The patient was started on aspirin, ticagrelor, intravenous heparin and atorvastatin. Left coronary angiogram through right radial access showed a proximal occlusion of the left circumflex artery, and a drugeluting stent was placed. Arteria lusoria accounted for the clinical dysphagia that the patient reported as his oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was found to be negative. This case illustrates the significance of an anomalous retrooesophageal right subclavian artery resulting in dysphagia symptoms that may be found incidentally on the coronary angiogram. Anomalous right subclavian artery (ARSA) is also known as arteria lusoria. It is one of the most common aortic arch anomalies with a prevalence of around 0.5%–2.5% in the general population. The right subclavian artery originates as the last branch of the aortic arch, travels towards and then down the right arm after crossing the midline of the body commonly, between the oesophagus and vertebral column (80% of cases) and less commonly, between the trachea and oesophagus (15% of cases). Most patients remain symptomfree throughout their lifetime, while others can develop symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnoea, coughing, pyrosis, retrosternal pain, acute limb ischaemia and even Horner’s syndrome. The clinical manifestations of arteria lusoria result from the compression of the oesophagus by the anteriorly placed right common carotid artery and trachea with the posteriorly coursing right subclavian artery. In 0.05%–0.1% of the population, dysphagia lusoria can also result from a left subclavian artery in the presence of a rightsided aortic arch and leftsided ligamentous arteriosum, which causes more severe symptoms due to the formation of a true vascular ring that constricts the oesophagus and trachea more significantly compared with the ARSA. Our patient presented with chest pain secondary to a nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction and dysphagia, which was secondary to a retrooesophageal aberrant right subclavian artery. Patients are usually treated symptomatically with proton pump inhibitors, alcohol and smoking cessation, but surgical intervention may be required if symptoms become severe and intractable.

Most DOA estimation methods use second-order measurements in the form of covariance matrices obtained from consecutive snapshots of the array elements’ raw data. In this paper, we pose the covariance-based DOA estimation problem in the random finite set framework of multitarget tracking using a superpositional model. The superpositional model allows for the measurements to be directly incorporated into a track-before-detect approximate cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter with a likelihood distributed as a complex Wishart random matrix that can perform DOA tracking with unknown time-varying number of sources. Complex Wishart and inverse-Wishart conjugacy is employed to derive the filter's update equations. The proposed filter is implemented using an auxiliary particle filter and simulation results showcase its improved performance in challenging scenarios of low (negative) signal-to-noise ratio and small number of snapshots.","","","","1fe82e04a147778fd8b71cf0e0c168db59a5edad","","","","","","A Covariance-Based Superpositional CPHD Filter for Multisource DOA Tracking","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fe82e04a147778fd8b71cf0e0c168db59a5edad","","2018"

Since the targets are angularly spread, we track the centroid Direction Of Arrival (DOA) of the target-generated (or backscattered) signal. The main challenge stems from the random target signals that, conditional to their respective states, constitute non-deterministic contributions to the system observation. The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we develop a Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter for tracking multiple targets with non-deterministic contributions, more specifically, Spherically Invariant Random Vector (SIRV) processes. This is achieved by analytically integrating the SIRV and angularly distributed target signals in the update step. Thus, ensuring a more efficient implementation than existing solutions, that generally consider augmenting the target state with the target signal. Secondly, we provide an improved auxiliary particle CPHD filter and clustering methodology. The auxiliary step is carried out for persistent particles, while for newly birthed particles an adaptive importance distribution is given. This is in contrast with existing solutions that only consider the auxiliary step for birthed particles. Simulated data results showcase the improved performance of the proposed filter.

However, the computation of subspace algorithms is complicated by eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or singular value decomposition (SVD). To simplify subspace algorithms, this paper proposes a fast one-dimensional (1D) DOA estimation algorithm for double parallel linear array (DPLA). In our algorithm, the equivalent noise subspace is constructed by processing the first column elements of the joint cross-covariance matrix (JCCM), and the DOA is estimated, using the root-multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The algorithm effectively simplifies and speeds up the computation by eliminating EVD or SVD. Simulation results confirm that our algorithm can improve the accuracy and reduce the time of DOA estimation. The research results have great application potential in DOA estimation tasks.","","","","39bce668f0a4e70bbeb455a38abd308fe9941a81","","","","","","A Computationally Efficient Estimation Algorithm for Direction of Arrival in Double Parallel Linear Array","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39bce668f0a4e70bbeb455a38abd308fe9941a81","","2020"

Sensor activation, and sensor management more generally, are of great interest in multi-agent networks and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where limited energy, sensing, and communication resources have to be efficiently allocated for optimal inference. Non-myopic control, resource constraints, and the partial observability of the Bernoulli target are the main challenges addressed in this work. The novelty of our approach is threefold. First, a belief-space Markov decision process (MDP) reformulation is proposed for the Bernoulli tracking and control problem that incorporates uncertainties in both object existence and object state. Second, a parametric family of sensor-activation distributions is proposed as control policies that harness the mutual information between the sensor measurements and the belief state. Thirdly, a novel reward metric is employed to capture the information gain on the Bernoulli belief state of a specific combination of sensor activations. A Bayesian actor-critic (BAC) reinforcement learning (RL) methodology is employed to further refine the policy by maximizing a discounted reward over an infinite horizon and under an imposed activation constraint.

In order to achieve the surface reconstruction of sonar target efficiently, the method firstly performs 2×2 grid block search for nonempty sonar data points using the adaptive threshold, and then searches for the 3×3 grid blocks with the empty point as the center to reduce the sonar image holes. Then the system performs 3×2 horizontal grid blocks and 2×3 vertical grid blocks search for sonar arrays to further improve the connectivity relation by finding the semi-diagonal connection.

The key process in this work involves obtaining the target’s position in space using two images of the same scene, acquired by an adaptive resolution imaging sonar (ARIS) at different positions. A data association algorithm was designed to connect the same target in image sequences. The goal of this work was to track multiple targets in 3D space. The ARIS provides sequences of bi-dimensional images from the backscattered energy according to the range and azimuth. The challenge involved determining the missing elevation information for the observed object within the sonar detection range. By computing the geometrical transformation between the acquisition planar images and the cubical space, using only the sonar information that included the posture and moving speed of the ARIS, the target’s elevation information was obtained. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an indoor experiment was conducted using the ARIS. On the basis of the experimental results, we confirmed that the proposed method effectively obtained the target’s position in 3D space. A moving target simulation was also conducted, and the results showed that this method was effective for moving targets.

To enhance the detection and tracking performance, a track-before-detect (TBD) based signal processing method is devised. Specifically, the raw bearing measurements generated after acoustic signal beamforming are directly used as the inputs of the proposed TBD processor. To handle the nonlinearity between target states and the raw bearing measurements, particle filter is employed to compute the joint multitarget probability density (JMPD) recursively through a Bayesian framework. Besides, the target initiation and termination steps are integrated into the particle filtering process as well to deal with the random births and deaths of multiple targets.

"1266",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","In a bistatic scenario, we consider the task of simultaneously estimating the positions of a non-cooperative transmitter and landmarks that reflect the transmitted signal, generating bistatic measurements at the receiver. Neither the position of the transmitter, nor the timing of transmissions are known to the receiver. With the use of the horizontal multi-path measurements caused by multiple reflection at the landmarks, the estimation of the unknown landmark locations is possible conditional upon the knowledge of the transmitter position. Thus two interdependent estimation problems arise in a similar fashion to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. An approach using a factorized density in a similar way to FastSLAM 2.0 is used. In contrast to the SLAM problem, the differing receiver and transmitter positions lead to a measurement function that is not only non-linear but also non-invertible. Due to the nature of the measurements, a particle filter is used to estimate the landmark as well as the transmitter receiver system state. A practical example for simulations consists of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a towed hydrophone antenna array.","","","","73cbe4e352c27dd5f5ebbcd554ea3a02dd9d1e26","","","","","","Bistatic simultaneous transmitter localization and mapping","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73cbe4e352c27dd5f5ebbcd554ea3a02dd9d1e26","","2015"

Materials and Methods 219 human pituitary tumors and 12 normal pituitary glands were studied. Angiogenic genes were quantified by an angiogenesis qPCR array and a TaqMan probe-based absolute qPCR. Angiogenesis inhibition in pituitary tumors was evaluated in vitro with the endothelial tube formation assay and in vivo in RbΔ19 mice. Results 71 angiogenic genes, 40 of which are known to be involved in sprouting angiogenesis, were differentially expressed in pituitary tumors. Expression of endothelial markers CD31, CD34, and ENG was significantly higher in pituitary tumors, by 5.6, 22.3, and 8.2-fold, respectively, compared to in normal pituitary tissue. There was no significant difference in levels of the lymphatic endothelial marker LYVE1 in pituitary tumors compared with normal pituitary gland tissue. Pituitary tumors also expressed significantly higher levels of angiogenesis growth factors, including VEGFA (4.2-fold), VEGFB (2.2), VEGFC (19.3), PGF (13.4), ANGPT2 (9.2), PDGFA (2.7), PDGFB (10.5) and TGFB1 (3.8) compared to normal pituitary tissue. Expression of VEGFC and PGF was highly correlated with the expression of endothelial markers in tumor samples, including CD31, CD34, and ENG (endoglin, a co-receptor for TGFβ). Furthermore, VEGFR inhibitors inhibited angiogenesis induced by human pituitary tumors and prolonged survival of RbΔ19 mice. Conclusion Human pituitary tumors are characterized by more active angiogenesis than normal pituitary gland tissue in a manner consistent with sprouting angiogenesis. Angiogenesis in pituitary tumors is regulated mainly by PGF and VEGFC, not VEGFA and VEGFB. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as the VEGFR2 inhibitor cabozantinib, may merit further investigation as therapies for aggressive human pituitary tumors.","","","","65cda4195cd39ab51306f76afd1dae64773265e1","","","","","","Sprouting Angiogenesis in Human Pituitary Adenomas","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65cda4195cd39ab51306f76afd1dae64773265e1","","2022"

The efficiency of existing antivascular treatments remains unsatisfactory. The transition of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) into tumor endothelioid cells (ECs) has been thought to cause glioma neovascularization and anti-angiogenesis tolerance, but the mechanisms regulating glioma transdifferentiation remains unclear. Our previous study found that P4HA1 regulates GSCs vascular mimicry in a hypoxic microenvironment, but the detailed molecular mechanism has not been determined. In this study, candidate protein COL6A1 was screened by mass spectrometry. In vitro experiments show that P4HA1 regulates the expression of CD31 via COL6A1, with the levels of expression of P4HA1, COL6A1 and the vascular endothelial molecular markers CD31 showing positive correlations in vivo assay. Altering the expression of P4HA1 in GSCs altered the expression of COL6A1 and CD31, thereby inducing glioma angiogenesis. In conclusion, this study revealed that the P4HA1/COL6A1 axis modulates the transdifferentiation process of GSCs into ECs.

We made the following primary findings: first, G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), the LPI receptor, is expressed in the endothelium of both human and mouse aortas, and is significantly upregulated in hyperlipidemia; second, LPIs upregulate 43 clusters of differentiation (CD) in HAECs, promoting EC activation, innate immune trans-differentiation, and immune/inflammatory responses; 72.1% of LPI-upregulated CDs are not induced in influenza virus-, MERS-CoV virus- and herpes virus-infected human endothelial cells, which hinted the specificity of LPIs in HAEC activation; third, LPIs upregulate six types of 640 secretomic genes (SGs), namely, 216 canonical SGs, 60 caspase-1-gasdermin D (GSDMD) SGs, 117 caspase-4/11-GSDMD SGs, 40 exosome SGs, 179 Human Protein Atlas (HPA)-cytokines, and 28 HPA-chemokines, which make HAECs a large secretory organ for inflammation/immune responses and other functions; fourth, LPIs activate transcriptomic remodeling by upregulating 172 transcription factors (TFs), namely, pro-inflammatory factors NR4A3, FOS, KLF3, and HIF1A; fifth, LPIs upregulate 152 nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial (mitoCarta) genes, which alter mitochondrial mechanisms and functions, such as mitochondrial organization, respiration, translation, and transport; sixth, LPIs activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) mechanism by upregulating 18 ROS regulators; finally, utilizing the Cytoscape software, we found that three mechanisms, namely, LPI-upregulated TFs, mitoCarta genes, and ROS regulators, are integrated to promote HAEC activation. Our results provide novel insights into aortic EC activation, formulate an EC biology knowledge-based transcriptomic profile strategy, and identify new targets for the development of therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory conditions, immune diseases, organ transplantation, aging, and cancers.","","","","7636689344dfc3563fca294931c6c6a0b3ca6e13","","","","","","Novel Knowledge-Based Transcriptomic Profiling of Lipid Lysophosphatidylinositol-Induced Endothelial Cell Activation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7636689344dfc3563fca294931c6c6a0b3ca6e13","","2021"

"1280",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Hard palate consists anteriorly of the palatal process of the maxilla (ppmx) and posteriorly of the palatal process of the palatine (ppp). Currently, palatal osteogenesis is receiving increasing attention. This is the first study to provide an overview of the osteogenesis process of the mouse hard palate. We found that the period in which avascular mesenchymal condensation becomes a vascularized bone structure corresponds to embryonic day (E) 14.5 to E16.5 in the hard palate. The ppmx and ppp differ remarkably in morphology and molecular respects during osteogenesis. Osteoclasts in the ppmx and ppp are heterogeneous. There was a multinucleated giant osteoclast on the bone surface at the lateral‐nasal side of the ppmx, while osteoclasts in the ppp were more abundant and adjacent to blood vessels but were smaller and had fewer nuclei. In addition, bone remodeling in the hard palate was asymmetric and exclusively occurred on the nasal side of the hard palate at E18.5. During angiogenesis, CD31‐positive endothelial cells were initially localized in the surrounding of palatal mesenchymal condensation and then invaded the condensation in a sprouting fashion. At the transcriptome level, we found 78 differentially expressed genes related to osteogenesis and angiogenesis between the ppmx and ppp. Fifty‐five related genes were up/downregulated from E14.5 to E16.5. Here, we described the morphogenesis and the heterogeneity in the osteogenic and angiogenic genes profiles of the ppmx and ppp, which are significant for subsequent studies of normal and abnormal subjects.","","","","d54d64981aa6db2ff90867da443a635678e3894b","","","","","","Osteogenic and angiogenic profiles of the palatal process of the maxilla and the palatal process of the palatine bone","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d54d64981aa6db2ff90867da443a635678e3894b","","2021"

Background Oral mucosa substitutes could contribute to the clinical treatment of complex diseases affecting the oral cavity. Although several models of artificial oral mucosa have been described, biointegration is a major issue that could be favored by the generation of novel substitutes with increased vascularization potential once grafted in vivo. Methods Three types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and dental pulp, and their in vitro potential was evaluated by inducing differentiation to the endothelial lineage using conditioning media. Then, 3D models of human artificial oral mucosa were generated using biocompatible fibrin‐agarose biomaterials combined with human oral mucosa fibroblasts and each type of MSC before and after induction to the endothelial lineage, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as controls. The vascularization potential of each oral mucosa substitute was assessed in vitro and in vivo in nude mice. Results In vitro induction of MSCs kept in culture was able to increase the expression of VEGF, CD31, and vWF endothelial markers, especially in bone marrow and dental pulp‐MSCs, and numerous proteins with a role in vasculogenesis become overexpressed. Then, in vivo grafting resulted in a significant increase in blood vessels formation at the interface area between the graft and the host tissues, with significantly positive expression of VEGF, CD31, vWF, and CD34 as compared to negative controls, especially when pre‐differentiated MSCs derived from bone marrow and dental pulp were used. In addition, a significantly higher number of cells committed to the endothelial lineage expressing the same endothelial markers were found within the bioartificial tissue. Conclusion Our results suggest that the use of pre‐differentiated MSCs could contribute to a rapid generation of a vascular network that may favor in vivo biointegration of bioengineered human oral mucosa substitutes.","","","","853cc55665102457c46d8c221c683ba608f7cc89","","","","","","Generation of a novel model of bioengineered human oral mucosa with increased vascularization potential","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/853cc55665102457c46d8c221c683ba608f7cc89","","2021"

OA is no longer thought to come from a purely biomechanical origin but rather one that has been increasingly recognized to include a persistent low-grade inflammatory component. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACSI) have become a widely used method for treating pain in patients with OA as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, as the disease progresses, IACSI become ineffective. FKBP51 is a regulatory protein of the glucocorticoid receptor function and have been shown to be dysregulated in several pathological scenario’s including chronic inflammation. Despite of these facts, to our knowledge, there are no previous studies of the expression and possible role of FKBP51 in OA. We investigated by double and triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy the cellular and subcellular expression of FKBP51 and its relations with inflammation factors in osteoarthritic knee joint tissues: specifically, in the tibial plateau knee cartilage, Hoffa’s fat pad and suprapatellar synovial tissue of the knee. Our results show co-expression of FKBP51 with TNF-α, IL-6, CD31 and CD34 in OA chondrocytes, synovial membrane cells and adipocytes in Hoffa’s fat pad. FKBP51 is also abundant in nerve fibers within the fat pad. Co-expression of FKBP51 protein with these markers may be indicative of its contribution to inflammatory processes and associated chronic pain in OA.","","","","cb2ebca5a4e3c3f20bf77f92a37aadb661811f3b","","","","","","Molecular-Morphological Relationships of the Scaffold Protein FKBP51 and Inflammatory Processes in Knee Osteoarthritis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb2ebca5a4e3c3f20bf77f92a37aadb661811f3b","","2021"

"1285",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Abstract The mechanism of bovine endometrial regeneration after parturition remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that bovine endometrial stem/progenitor cells participate in the postpartum regeneration of the endometrium. Flow cytometry analysis identified the presence of side population (SP) cells among endometrial stromal cells. Endometrial SP cells were shown to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. RNA-seq data showed that the gene expression pattern was different between bovine endometrial SP cells and main population cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified the enrichment of stemness genes in SP cells. Significantly (false discovery rate < 0.01) upregulated genes in SP cells contained several stem cell marker genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the upregulated genes in SP cells showed enrichment of terms related to RNA metabolic process and transcription. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of upregulated genes in SP cells revealed enrichment of signaling pathways associated with maintenance and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. The terms involved in TCA cycles were enriched in GO and KEGG pathway analysis of downregulated genes in SP cells. These results support the assumption that bovine endometrial SP cells exhibit characteristics of somatic stem/progenitor cells. The ratio of SP cells to endometrial cells was lowest on days 9–11 after parturition, which gradually increased thereafter. SP cells were shown to differentiate into epithelial cells. Collectively, these results suggest that bovine endometrial SP cells were temporarily reduced immediately after calving possibly due to their differentiation to provide new endometrial cells. Summary sentence: The ratio of bovine endometrial side population cells, showing characteristics similar to those of somatic stem/progenitor cells, was the lowest on days 9–11 after parturition and then increased gradually.","","","","fbe641a05e8d4fa5cb9d0946426ec58ecedd8239","","","","","","Gene-expression profile and postpartum transition of bovine endometrial side population cells†","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbe641a05e8d4fa5cb9d0946426ec58ecedd8239","","2021"
"1286",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Tumor-induced remodeling of the microenvironment in lymph nodes (LNs) includes the formation of blood vessels, which goes beyond the regulation of metabolism, and shaping a survival niche for tumor cells. In contrast to solid tumors, which primarily rely on neo-angiogenesis, hematopoietic malignancies usually grow within pre-vascularized autochthonous niches in secondary lymphatic organs or the bone marrow. The mechanisms of vascular remodeling in expanding LNs during infection-induced responses have been studied in more detail; in contrast, insights into the conditions of lymphoma growth and lodging remain enigmatic. Based on previous murine studies and clinical trials in human, we conclude that there is not a universal LN-specific angiogenic program applicable. Instead, signaling pathways that are tightly connected to autochthonous and infiltrating cell types contribute variably to LN vascular expansion. Inflammation related angiogenesis within LNs relies on dendritic cell derived pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in fibroblastic reticular cells, which in turn triggers vessel growth. In high-grade B cell lymphoma, angiogenesis correlates with poor prognosis. Lymphoma cells immigrate and grow in LNs and provide pro-angiogenic growth factors themselves. In contrast to infectious stimuli that impact on LN vasculature, they do not trigger the typical inflammatory and hypoxia-related stroma-remodeling cascade. Blood vessels in LNs are unique in selective recruitment of lymphocytes via high endothelial venules (HEVs). The dissemination routes of neoplastic lymphocytes are usually disease stage dependent. Early seeding via the blood stream requires the expression of the homeostatic chemokine receptor CCR7 and of L-selectin, both cooperate to facilitate transmigration of tumor and also of protective tumor-reactive lymphocytes via HEV structures. In this view, the HEV route is not only relevant for lymphoma cell homing, but also for a continuous immunosurveillance. We envision that HEV functional and structural alterations during lymphomagenesis are not only key to vascular remodeling, but also impact on tumor cell accessibility when targeted by T cell–mediated immunotherapies.","","","","bc4f491e661f5170e3e957ae5e87160e2519b51c","","","","","","Angiogenesis in Lymph Nodes Is a Critical Regulator of Immune Response and Lymphoma Growth","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc4f491e661f5170e3e957ae5e87160e2519b51c","","2020"
"1287",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic factor sensed by most cells. It regulates a broad spectrum of cellular responses including hematopoiesis. In order to process TGF-β1-responses in time and space in an appropriate manner, there is a tight regulation of its signaling at diverse steps. The downstream signaling is mediated by type I and type II receptors and modulated by the ‘accessory’ receptor Endoglin also termed cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105). Endoglin was initially identified on pre-B leukemia cells but has received most attention due to its high expression on activated endothelial cells. In turn, Endoglin has been figured out as the causative factor for diseases associated with vascular dysfunction like hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-1 (HHT-1), pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUPR). Because HHT patients often show signs of inflammation at vascular lesions, and loss of Endoglin in the myeloid lineage leads to spontaneous inflammation, it is speculated that Endoglin impacts inflammatory processes. In line, Endoglin is expressed on progenitor/precursor cells during hematopoiesis as well as on mature, differentiated cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, so far only pro-monocytes and macrophages have been in the focus of research, although Endoglin has been identified in many other immune system cell subsets. These findings imply a functional role of Endoglin in the maturation and function of immune cells. Aside the functional relevance of Endoglin in endothelial cells, CD105 is differentially expressed during hematopoiesis, arguing for a role of this receptor in the development of individual cell lineages. In addition, Endoglin expression is present on mature immune cells of the innate (i.e., macrophages and mast cells) and the adaptive (i.e., T-cells) immune system, further suggesting Endoglin as a factor that shapes immune responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on Endoglin expression and function in hematopoietic precursors and mature hematopoietic cells of different lineages.","","","","f615ebcd56c54ac92dbe6b50333334b8dcc37d85","","","","","","Endoglin: An ‘Accessory’ Receptor Regulating Blood Cell Development and Inflammation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f615ebcd56c54ac92dbe6b50333334b8dcc37d85","","2020"

There is currently no report on the distribution and variation of the CMVECs in different brain regions in humans. This study investigated microcirculation in the adult human brain by the characterization of the expression pattern of brain endothelial cell markers in different brain regions. Five different brain regions consisting of the visual cortex, the hippocampus, the precentral gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, and the rhinal cortex obtained from three normal adult human brain specimens were studied and analyzed for the expression of the endothelial cell markers: cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and von-Willebrand-Factor (vWF) through immunohistochemistry. We observed differences in the expression pattern of CD31 and vWF between the gray matter and the white matter in the brain regions. Furthermore, there were also regional variations in the pattern of expression of the endothelial cell biomarkers. Thus, this suggests differences in the nature of vascularization in various regions of the human brain. These observations also suggest the existence of variation in structure and function of different brain regions, which could reflect in the pathophysiological outcomes in a diseased state.","","","","fc905346a3a6e9012d9d63ef4ebc595fa4db101e","","","","","","Differential Expression of CD31 and Von Willebrand Factor on Endothelial Cells in Different Regions of the Human Brain: Potential Implications for Cerebral Malaria Pathogenesis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc905346a3a6e9012d9d63ef4ebc595fa4db101e","","2020"
"1292",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Abstract Introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the therapy of patients with coronary artery disease resulted in the significant reduction of in-stent restenosis compared to bare-metal stent (BMS) treatment. However, the high incidence of late stent thrombosis with DES emerged as one of the safety concerns after their implantation. Enhancing stent endothelization by improved early healing and neointimal strut coverage emerged as possible solution for this late complication. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) capturing stents are designed to promote in situ endothelization with immobilized, antihuman, anti-CD34 antibodies attached to the luminal stent surface. Anti-CD34 antibodies target and capture EPC from circulation, which further differentiate into vascular endothelial cells and form functional endothelial layer on the stent surface. These cells are also capable of secreting pro-angiogenic factors that stimulate local endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate. Preclinical and clinical studies proved feasibility, efficacy and safety of EPC capturing stents in stable and high-risk patients with coronary artery disease. Rapid and extensive endothelization of EPC capturing stents translated into favorable profile of clinical outcomes, comparable to efficacy of BMSs and DESs. Therefore, we here present the most important results from the experimental and clinical studies that explored ECP capturing strategy to enhance endothelization, reduce the incidence of instent thrombosis and improve outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease, along with the future perspectives in this promising therapeutic approach.","","","","a4f2a64c10c58e31d3634d0880b7b7b0419f7d61","","","","","","Capturing Endothelial Cells by Coronary Stents - From Histology to Clinical Outcomes","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4f2a64c10c58e31d3634d0880b7b7b0419f7d61","","2019"

In order to assess intratumoral vascularization and the efficiency of blood flow in locally advanced gastric cancer, we examined 57 patients through pCLE imaging. The vascular alterations in gastric cancer were mainly characterized by leakage and by the presence of tortuous and large size vessels. Defects in blood flow were detected very rarely. No association between the angiogenic score and the gastric tumor site or histological type was observed. Interestingly, no correlation was also found with the tumor grading indicating that the vascular angiogenic anomalies in gastric cancer represent an early pathological event to be observed and detected. The majority of patients displayed unchanged vascular alterations following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and this positively correlated with stable or progressive disease, suggesting that an unaltered angiogenic score could per se be indicative of poor therapeutic efficacy. Different vascular parameters were evaluated by immunofluorescence using bioptic samples and the vessel density did not correlate with clinical staging, site or histologic type. Interestingly, only CD105, Multimerin-2 and GLUT1 were able to discriminate normal from tumoral gastric mucosa. Taken together, these findings indicate that functional and structural angiogenic parameters characteristic of tumor blood network were fully detectable by pCLE. Moreover, the evaluation of tumor vasculature by real-time assessment may provide useful information to achieve tailored therapeutic interventions for gastric cancer patients.","","","","4431f4ed21ea0985817d26a08f4747bcb5381f5e","","","","","","The Probe Based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) in Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Powerful Technique for Real–Time Analysis of Vasculature","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4431f4ed21ea0985817d26a08f4747bcb5381f5e","","2019"

Accordingly, we aimed to quantify the efficacy of various antihypertensive regimens on sEng levels, in hypertensive patients with endothelial dysfunction. Patients and methods: 323 patients were enrolled, and there were 99 patients with normal blood pressure values, 106 hypertensive patients under chronic treatment with different types of antihypertensive molecules (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics) in monotherapy, and 118 hypertensive patients under chronic treatment with perindopril. sEng plasma levels were quantified and were correlated with classical methods of assessing the endothelial damage. Results: Patients under chronic treatment with perindopril had lower sEng plasma levels compared with the other group of hypertensive patients under different regimens of antihypertensive treatment (sEng: 4.73±1.39 versus 5.63±2.33, p<0.01). Conclusion: Decreased sEng plasma levels were found in patients under chronic treatment with perindopril, when compared with other antihypertensive regimens of treatment (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or diuretics).","","","","1ad5cb5c3f23e979478da6ec977e0eb8095caabe","","","","","","Decreased sEng plasma levels in hypertensive patients with endothelial dysfunction under chronic treatment with Perindopril","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ad5cb5c3f23e979478da6ec977e0eb8095caabe","","2019"

However, to date, none of the available techniques and/or endothelial markers employed to assess angiogenesis in the implant/host interface seems to be able to highlight vascular structures convincingly. In the present study we investigated and compared the expression of two endothelial cell markers: platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) (CD31) and endoglin (CD105) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) to identify and quantify newly formed blood vessels in subcutaneous implants of polyether-polyurethane sponge of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. At day 14 post implantation the discs of the synthetic matrix were removed and processed for histological and morphometric analysis. In IHC staining for CD31 antibody the number of vessels was 2.27±0.69 and 5.25±0.46 for CD105. In IF for CD31 the number of vessels was 15.36±1.295 and 10.54±0.8213 for CD105. The level of cross-reaction was lesser in IF images compared with IHC images. Co-localization of CD31/CD105 using confocal images showed positive correlation (Pearson's co-relation and Manders' equation). The double labeling for blood vessels using the IF technique for CD31/CD105 may be an important tool for evaluation of angiogenesis in biomaterial/host integration.","","","","729c6d1407dd39e62d7fa3a1b3219616fdd6fb77","","","","","","Double immunofluorescence labeling for CD31 and CD105 as a marker for polyether polyurethane-induced angiogenesis in mice.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/729c6d1407dd39e62d7fa3a1b3219616fdd6fb77","","2019"

IDO has also received more attention because of its non-immune functions including regulating angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of IDO on microvessel density (MVD), and to explore its prognostic role in breast cancer. We showed IDO expression was positively correlated with MVD labeled by CD105 (MVD-CD105) rather than MVD labeled by CD31 (MVD-CD31) in breast cancer specimens. Both IDO expression and MVD-CD105 level were associated with initial TNM stage, histological grade, and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) metastasis in breast cancer. In the prognostic analysis, TDLNs metastasis, an advanced TNM stage (III) and high histological grade (III) significantly predicted shorter survival in univariate analysis. Concentrating on IDO and MVD, the patients with IDO expression or high MVD level had poorer prognosis compared with no IDO expression [P = 0.047 for progress-free survival (PFS)] and low MVD level (P = 0.019 for OS); the patients with IDO expression and high MVD level had a tendency with shorter overall survival when compared with non IDO expression, low MVD level, or both (P = 0.062 for OS). In multivariate analysis, an advanced TNM stage (III) was significantly associated with shorter 5-year survival rate of PFS (HR: 0.126, 95% CI: 0.024–0.669, P = 0.015). In order to verify the phenomenon of IDO promoting angiogenesis, we contained the study in vitro. We detected the expression of IDO mRNA in breast cancer cell lines and measured the concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine in the supernatants of MCF-7 by high performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of Kyn and trp (kyn/trp) was calculated to estimate IDO-enzyme activity. MCF-7 cells, which produce high level of IDO and metabolize tryptophan, promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation significantly in co-culture system. Meanwhile IDO could upregulate the expression of CD105 in HUVEC, which was downregulated after adding IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl-d-trytophan. These results suggest that IDO could promote angiogenesis in breast cancer, providing a novel, potentially effective molecular or gene therapy target for angiogenesis inhibition in the future.","","","","171a9fa03002b909fc8c4eca3bd0ec61ec6884c1","","","","","","High Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Is Correlated With Microvessel Density and Worse Prognosis in Breast Cancer","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/171a9fa03002b909fc8c4eca3bd0ec61ec6884c1","","2018"

Despite human cAVM tissues having a minor population of ECs, they play an important role in the manifestation and development of cAVM as well as in hemorrhagic stroke and thrombogenesis. To characterize and understand the biology of ECs in human cAVM (cAVM-ECs), methods for the isolation and purification of these cells are necessary. We have developed this method to reliably obtain pure populations of ECs from cAVMs. To obtain pure cell populations, cAVM tissues were mechanically and enzymatically digested and the resulting single cAVM-ECs suspensions were then labeled with antibodies of specific cell antigens and selected by flow cytometry. Purified ECs were detected using specific makers of ECs by immunostaining and used to study different cellular mechanisms. Compared to the different methods of isolating ECs from tissues, we could isolate ECs from cAVMs confidently, and the numbers of cAVM-ECs harvested were almost similar to the amounts present in vessel components. In addition to optimizing the protocol for isolation of ECs from human cAVM tissues, the protocol could also be applied to isolate ECs from other human neurovascular-diseased tissues. Depending on the tissues, the whole procedure could be completed in about 20 days.","","","","014f5c0314e3644a6f884c2fdb5d2a1dbc5a66a9","","","","","","Procedure for the Isolation of Endothelial Cells from Human Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation (cAVM) Tissues","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014f5c0314e3644a6f884c2fdb5d2a1dbc5a66a9","","2018"

The changes in microcirculation during sepsis can be explained by the alterations in the endothelial barrier function. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a potential recovery index of endothelial function and it an increase in response to neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was demonstrated. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of NMES in patients with septic shock. Methods and analysis: It is a study protocol for a randomized cross-over design in an intensive care unit of a tertiary University hospital. Thirty-one patients aged 18 to 65 years. The study will be divided in 2 phases: the phase one will be held in the first 72 hours of septic shock and the phase two after 3 days of first assessment. Patients will be randomly selected to the intervention protocol (decubitus position with the limbs raised and NMES) and control protocol (decubitus position with the limbs raised without NMES). After this procedure, the patients will be allocated in group 1 (intervention and control protocol) or group 2 (control and intervention protocol) with a wash-out period of 4 to 6 hours between them. The main outcome is mobilization of EPCs. The secondary outcome is metabolic and hemodynamic data.

Defects in placental vasculature and trophoblast have been identified in several pregnancy complications. Thus, the detailed molecular profile and heterogeneity of endothelial cells and trophoblasts in placentas will aid us in better understanding placental behaviors and improving pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to profile the transcriptomics of human placental villous tissues from eleven patients with normal pregnancies in the first and second trimesters (6–16 weeks of gestation). Results: The transcriptomic landscape of 52,179 single cells was obtained, and the cells were classified as trophoblasts, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, erythroid cells, Hofbauer cells, and macrophages. Our analysis further revealed the three subtypes of placental endothelial cells, with distinct metabolic signatures and transcription factor regulatory networks. We also determined the transcriptomic features of the trophoblast subpopulations and characterized two distinct populations of progenitor cells in cytotrophoblasts, which were capable of differentiating to extravillous trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, respectively. Conclusions: Our study provided a high-resolution molecular profile of the human placenta between 6 and 16 weeks of gestation. Our data revealed the placental cell complexity and demonstrated the transcriptional networks and signaling involved in placental endothelial and trophoblast differentiation during early pregnancy, which will be a resource for future studies of the human placental development.","","","","e80eb18f2858212384bcd8f7db1c1dc91e5f5010","","","","","","Human Placental Endothelial Cell and Trophoblast Heterogeneity and Differentiation Revealed by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e80eb18f2858212384bcd8f7db1c1dc91e5f5010","","2022"
"1308",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","New insights into the cellular and extra-cellular composition of scar tissue after myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. Recently, a heterogeneous podoplanin-expressing cell population has been associated with fibrogenic and inflammatory responses and lymphatic vessel growth during scar formation. Podoplanin is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in heart development, cell motility, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. In the adult mouse heart, podoplanin is expressed only by cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells; after MI, it is acquired with an unexpected heterogeneity by PDGFRα-, PDGFRβ-, and CD34-positive cells. Podoplanin may therefore represent a sign of activation of a cohort of progenitor cells during different phases of post-ischemic myocardial wound repair. Podoplanin binds to C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) which is exclusively expressed by platelets and a variety of immune cells. CLEC-2 is upregulated in CD11bhigh cells, including monocytes and macrophages, following inflammatory stimuli. We recently published that inhibition of the interaction between podoplanin-expressing cells and podoplanin-binding cells using podoplanin-neutralizing antibodies reduces but does not fully suppress inflammation post-MI while improving heart function and scar composition after ischemic injury. These data support an emerging and alternative mechanism of interactome in the heart that, when neutralized, leads to altered inflammatory response and preservation of cardiac function and structure. The overarching objective of this review is to assimilate and discuss the available evidence on the functional role of podoplanin-positive cells on cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. A detailed characterization of cell-to-cell interactions and paracrine signals between podoplanin-expressing cells and the other type of cells that compose the heart tissue is needed to open a new line of investigation extending beyond the known function of these cells. This review attempts to discuss the role and biology of podoplanin-positive cells in the context of cardiac injury, repair, and remodeling.","","","","77389f04e20f4e5919bbcdc77244f6597a33c73f","","","","","","Role of Podoplanin-Positive Cells in Cardiac Fibrosis and Angiogenesis After Ischemia","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77389f04e20f4e5919bbcdc77244f6597a33c73f","","2021"

Background: The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), known to remodel in disease and have an extensive secretome, has recently been isolated from the human heart. However, the effects of normal and diseased cardiac MSCs on myocyte electrophysiology remain unclear. We hypothesize that in disease the inflammatory secretome of cardiac human MSCs (hMSCs) remodels and can regulate arrhythmia substrates. Methods: hMSCs were isolated from patients with or without heart failure from tissue attached to extracted device leads and from samples taken from explanted/donor hearts. Failing hMSCs or nonfailing hMSCs were cocultured with normal human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Using fluorescent indicators, action potential duration, Ca2+ alternans, and spontaneous calcium release (SCR) incidence were determined. Results: Failing and nonfailing hMSCs from both sources exhibited similar trilineage differentiation potential and cell surface marker expression as bone marrow hMSCs. Compared with nonfailing hMSCs, failing hMSCs prolonged action potential duration by 24% (P<0.001, n=15), increased Ca2+ alternans by 300% (P<0.001, n=18), and promoted spontaneous calcium release activity (n=14, P<0.013) in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Failing hMSCs exhibited increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL (interleukin)-1β (98%, P<0.0001) and IL-6 (460%, P<0.02) compared with nonfailing hMSCs. IL-1β or IL-6 in the absence of hMSCs prolonged action potential duration but only IL-6 increased Ca2+ alternans and promoted spontaneous calcium release activity in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, replicating the effects of failing hMSCs. In contrast, nonfailing hMSCs prevented Ca2+ alternans in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells during oxidative stress. Finally, nonfailing hMSCs exhibited >25× higher secretion of IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-1 compared with failing hMSCs. Importantly, IGF-1 supplementation or anti–IL-6 treatment rescued the arrhythmia substrates induced by failing hMSCs. Conclusions: We identified device leads as a novel source of cardiac hMSCs. Our findings show that cardiac hMSCs can regulate arrhythmia substrates by remodeling their secretome in disease. Importantly, therapy inhibiting (anti–IL-6) or mimicking (IGF-1) the cardiac hMSC secretome can rescue arrhythmia substrates.","","","","312a4f99f3c10001f56289b44c0b7e94807b0d00","","","","","","Human Cardiac Mesenchymal Stem Cells Remodel in Disease and Can Regulate Arrhythmia Substrates","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/312a4f99f3c10001f56289b44c0b7e94807b0d00","","2020"

Most ARVC mutations interfere with β-catenin–dependent transcription that enhances adipogenesis; however, the mechanistic pathway to arrhythmogenesis is not clear. We hypothesized that adipogenic conditions play an important role in the formation of arrhythmia substrates in ARVC. Cardiac myocyte monolayers co-cultured for 2–4 days with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells with the ARVC5 TMEM43 p.Ser358Leu mutation. The TMEM43 mutation in myocyte co-cultures alone had no significant effect on impulse conduction velocity (CV) or APD. In contrast, when co-cultures were exposed to pro-adipogenic factors for 2–4 days, CV and APD were significantly reduced compared to controls by 49% and 31%, respectively without evidence of adipogenesis. Additionally, these arrhythmia substrates coincided with a significant reduction in IGF-1 expression in MSCs and were mitigated by IGF-1 treatment. These findings suggest that the onset of enhanced adipogenic signaling may be a mechanism of early arrhythmogenesis, which could lead to personalized treatment for arrhythmias associated with TMEM43 and other ARVC mutations.","","","","347f6a7c418d0a45b79f052e1404145d82a1ade4","","","","","","Adipogenic Signaling Promotes Arrhythmia Substrates before Structural Abnormalities in TMEM43 ARVC","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/347f6a7c418d0a45b79f052e1404145d82a1ade4","","2022"

To identify novel miR–mRNA pairs, we performed RNA-seq from atrial biopsies of persistent AF patients and non-AF patients with normal sinus rhythm (SR). Differentially expressed miRs (11 down and 9 up) and mRNAs (95 up and 82 down) were identified and hierarchically clustered in a heat map. Subsequently, GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were run to identify deregulated pathways. Then, miR targets were predicted in the miRDB database, and a regulatory network of negatively correlated miR–mRNA pairs was constructed using Cytoscape. To select potential candidate genes from GSEA analysis, the top-50 enriched genes in GSEA were overlaid with predicted targets of differentially deregulated miRs. Further, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of enriched genes in GSEA was constructed, and subsequently, GO and canonical pathway analyses were run for genes in the PPI network. Our analyses showed that TNF-α, p53, EMT, and SYDECAN1 signaling were among the highly affected pathways in AF samples. SDC-1 (SYNDECAN-1) was the top-enriched gene in p53, EMT, and SYDECAN1 signaling. Consistently, SDC-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in atrial samples of AF patients. Among negatively correlated miRs, miR-302b-3p was experimentally validated to suppress SDC-1 transcript levels. Overall, our results suggested that the miR-302b-3p/SDC-1 axis may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF.","","","","b1cf5824fba63c75243a967c56f5ebd2307303a5","","","","","","Integrated Analysis of the microRNA–mRNA Network Predicts Potential Regulators of Atrial Fibrillation in Humans","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1cf5824fba63c75243a967c56f5ebd2307303a5","","2022"

Recent evidence suggests that the exaggerated host immune-inflammatory response characterizing the disease, specifically interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase, may have an important role, possibly via direct effects on cardiac electrophysiology. The aim of this study was to dissect the short-term discrete impact of IL-6 elevation on QTc in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods We investigated the following mechanisms: (1) the QTc duration in patients with COVID-19 during the active phase and recovery, and its association with C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels; (2) the acute impact of IL-6 administration on QTc in an in vivo guinea pig model; and (3) the electrophysiological effects of IL-6 on ventricular myocytes in vitro. Results In patients with active severe COVID-19 and elevated IL-6 levels, regardless of acute myocardial injury/strain and concomitant QT-prolonging risk factors, QTc was significantly prolonged and rapidly normalized in correlation with IL-6 decrease. The direct administration of IL-6 in an in vivo guinea pig model acutely prolongs QTc duration. Moreover, ventricular myocytes incubated in vitro with IL-6 show evident prolongation in the action potential, along with significant inhibition in the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr). Conclusion For the first time, we demonstrated that in severe COVID-19, systemic inflammatory activation can per se promote QTc prolongation via IL-6 elevation, leading to ventricular electric remodeling. Despite being transitory, such modifications may significantly contribute to arrhythmic events and associated poor outcomes in COVID-19. These findings provide a further rationale for current anti-inflammatory treatments for COVID-19, including IL-6-targeted therapies.","","","","3dea2294573bfc36b9fefac68dc0157245972a8a","","","","","","Interleukin-6 Elevation Is a Key Pathogenic Factor Underlying COVID-19-Associated Heart Rate-Corrected QT Interval Prolongation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dea2294573bfc36b9fefac68dc0157245972a8a","","2022"

Fibro‐fatty infiltrate, a clinical hallmark, progresses with the disease and can develop across both ventricles. Pathogenic variants in genes have been identified, with most being responsible for encoding cardiac desmosome proteins that reside at myocyte boundaries that are critical for cell‐to‐cell coupling. Despite some understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms associated with ARVC mutations, their relationship with arrhythmogenesis is complex and not well understood for a monogenetic disorder. This review article focuses on arrhythmia mechanisms in ARVC based on clinical and animal studies and their relationship with disease causing variants.

Although most studies focus on the relationship between NAFLD and atrial fibrillation, associations with ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac conduction defects have also been reported. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a number of NAFLD-related pathophysiological alterations may potentially elicit structural, electrical, and autonomic remodeling in the heart, contributing to arrhythmogenic substrates in the heart. NAFLD is now the most common liver and metabolic disease in the world. However, the upsurge in the prevalence of NAFLD as an emerging risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias has received little attention. In this review, we summarize the clinical evidence and putative pathophysiological mechanisms for the emerging roles of NAFLD in cardiac arrhythmias, with the purpose of highlighting the notion that NAFLD may serve as an independent risk factor and a potential driving force in the development and progression of cardiac arrhythmias.","","","","d1a17e707931f02e9a305611866e5d5c10f6de9e","","","","","","Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1a17e707931f02e9a305611866e5d5c10f6de9e","","2021"

Stem cell derived exosomes, in particular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been shown previously to largely replicate the therapeutic activity associated with the cells themselves, which suggests that exosomes may be a useful cell-free alternative for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. However, the mechanisms that govern how exosomes home to damaged cells and tissues or the uptake and distribution of exosomal cargo are poorly characterized, because techniques for distinguishing between exosomal proteins and proteins in the targeted tissues are lacking. Here, we report the development of an in vivo model that enabled the visualization, tracking, and quantification of proteins from systemically administered MSC exosomes. The model uses bioorthogonal chemistry and cell-selective metabolic labeling to incorporate the non-canonical amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL) into the MSC proteome. ANL incorporation is facilitated via expression of a mutant (L274G) methionyl-tRNA-synthetase (MetRS∗) and subsequent incubation with ANL-supplemented media; after which ANL can be covalently linked to alkyne-conjugated reagents (e.g., dyes and resins) via click chemistry. Our results demonstrate that when the exosomes produced by ANL-treated, MetRS∗-expressing MSCs were systemically administered to mice, the ANL-labeled exosomal proteins could be accurately and reliably identified, isolated, and quantified from a variety of mouse organs, and that myocardial infarction (MI) both increased the abundance of exosomal proteins and redistributed a number of them from the membrane fraction of intact hearts to the cytosol of cells in infarcted hearts. Additionally, we found that Desmoglein-1c is enriched in MSC exosomes and taken up by ischemic myocardium. Collectively, our results indicate that this newly developed bioorthogonal system can provide crucial insights into exosome homing, as well as the uptake and biodistribution of exosomal proteins.","","","","483145420d03552bc487c7a4096ac2f751e1de33","","","","","","Visualization and Identification of Bioorthogonally Labeled Exosome Proteins Following Systemic Administration in Mice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/483145420d03552bc487c7a4096ac2f751e1de33","","2021"

However, the predictive value of a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) for myocardial injury and long-term mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection is not well known. Purpose To evaluate the association of prolonged QTc with myocardial injury and with 1-year mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods A total of 335 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection were prospectively studied. All patients underwent a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation within 48 h from admission. Using the Bazett formula, the QTc interval was calculated from the first ECG tracing recorded at the ER. QTc ≥ 440 ms in males and ≥450 ms in females was considered prolonged. Patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers and/or echocardiographic signs of myocardial dysfunction were considered to have myocardial injury. The predictive value of QTc prolongation for myocardial injury was calculated using a multivariate binary regression model. One-year mortality rate of patients with and without QTc prolongation was compared using the log-rank test, and a multivariate Cox regression model adjusting for multiple covariates was performed to evaluate the 1-year mortality risk. Results One-hundred and nine (32.5%) patients had a prolonged QTc. Compared to patients without QTc prolongation, patients with prolonged QTc were older (70 ± 14.4 vs. 62.7 ± 16.6, p < 0.001), had more comorbidities, and presented with a more severe disease. Prolonged QTc was an independent predictor for severe or critical disease (adjusted HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.3–3.5; p = 0.002) and myocardial injury (adjusted HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22–3.5; p = 0.007). One-year mortality of patients with prolonged QTc was higher than those with no QTc prolongation (40.4% vs. 15.5; p < 0.001). Following adjustment to multiple covariates including myocardial injury and disease severity, QTc prolongation was found to be associated with increased 1-year mortality risk (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.06–2.68, p = 0.027). Conclusion Prolonged QTc is associated with disease severity, myocardial injury and 1-year mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.","","","","771791a2fce3ed3056ce29cdcbd518a43e6e8e08","","","","","","QT INTERVAL PROLONGATION IS A NOVEL PREDICTOR OF 1-YEAR MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/771791a2fce3ed3056ce29cdcbd518a43e6e8e08","","2022"

However, traditional treatment methods for MI have some limitations, such as irreversible myocardial necrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Fortunately, recent endeavors have shown that hydrogel materials can effectively prevent negative remodeling of the heart and improve the heart function and long-term prognosis of patients with MI due to their good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and electrical conductivity. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the research progress of injectable hydrogel in the treatment of MI in recent years and to introduce the rational design of injectable hydrogels in myocardial repair. Finally, the potential challenges and perspectives of injectable hydrogel in this field will be discussed, in order to provide theoretical guidance for the development of new and effective treatment strategies for MI.","","","","9d35d0f05234c62a3d82e4c6176ee10a7ff55940","","","","","","Research Advances of Injectable Functional Hydrogel Materials in the Treatment of Myocardial Infarction","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9d35d0f05234c62a3d82e4c6176ee10a7ff55940","","2022"

Therefore, we explored the epidemiological characteristics of MAFLD from adults along with the association of MAFLD and 12-ECG diagnosed AF in a nationwide population from health check-up centers. Methods This observational study used cross-sectional and longitudinal studies with 2,083,984 subjects from 2009 to 2017. Age-, sex-, and regional-standardized prevalence of MAFLD was estimated. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subclusters of MAFLD. Multivariable logistic regression and mixed-effects Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationship between MAFLD and AF. Results The prevalence of MAFLD increased from 22.75% to 35.58% during the study period, with higher rates in males and populations with high BMI or resided in northern regions. The MAFLD population was clustered into three classes with different metabolic features by LCA. Notably, a high proportion of MAFLD patients in all clusters had overweight and prediabetes or diabetes. The MAFLD was significantly associated with a higher risk of AF in the cross-sectional study and in the longitudinal study. In addition, the coexistence of prediabetes or diabetes had the largest impact on subsequent AF. Conclusion Our findings suggested a high prevalence of MAFLD and a high prevalence of other metabolic diseases in the MAFLD population, particularly overweight and glucose dysregulation. Moreover, MAFLD was associated with a significantly higher risk for existing and subsequent subclinical AF in the Chinese population.","","","","dba79afbf9ce4393b0ac89c6ccf86774eb8f29b2","","","","","","The prevalence of MAFLD and its association with atrial fibrillation in a nationwide health check-up population in China","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dba79afbf9ce4393b0ac89c6ccf86774eb8f29b2","","2022"

However, the pathogenesis leading to AF in the context of MAFLD remains unclear. We therefore aimed at assessing the impact of MAFLD and liver fibrosis status on left atrium (LA) structure and function. Methods Patients with a Fatty Liver Index (FLI) >60 and the presence of metabolic comorbidities were classified as MAFLD+. In MAFLD+ patients, liver fibrosis severity was defined using the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Fibrosis Score (NFS), as follows: MAFLD w/o fibrosis (NFS ≦ −1.455), MAFLD w/indeterminate fibrosis (−1.455 < NFS < 0.675), and MAFLD w/fibrosis (NFS ≧ 0.675). In the first cohort of patients undergoing AF ablation, the structural and functional impact on LA of MAFLD was assessed by LA strain analysis and endocardial voltage mapping. Histopathological assessment of atrial fibrosis was performed in the second cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Finally, the impact of MAFLD on AF recurrence following catheter ablation was assessed. Results In the AF ablation cohort (NoMAFLD n = 123; MAFLD w/o fibrosis n = 37; MAFLD indeterm. fibrosis n = 75; MAFLD w/severe fibrosis n = 10), MAFLD patients with high risk of F3–F4 liver fibrosis presented more LA low-voltage areas as compared to patients without MAFLD (16.5 [10.25; 28] vs 5.0 [1; 11] low-voltage areas p = 0.0115), impaired LA reservoir function assessed by peak left atrial longitudinal strain (19.7% ± 8% vs 8.9% ± 0.89% p = 0.0268), and increased LA volume (52.9 ± 11.7 vs 43.5 ± 18.0 ml/m2 p = 0.0168). Accordingly, among the MAFLD patients, those with a high risk of F3–F4 liver fibrosis presented a higher rate of AF recurrence during follow-up (p = 0.0179). In the cardiac surgery cohort (NoMAFLD n = 12; MAFLD w/o fibrosis n = 5; MAFLD w/fibrosis n = 3), an increase in histopathological atrial fibrosis was observed in MAFLD patients with a high risk of F3–F4 liver fibrosis (p = 0.0206 vs NoMAFLD; p = 0.0595 vs MAFLD w/o fibrosis). Conclusion In conclusion, we found that liver fibrosis scoring in MAFLD patients is associated with adverse atrial remodeling and AF recurrences following catheter ablation. The impact of the management of MAFLD on LA remodeling and AF ablation outcomes should be assessed in dedicated studies.","","","","3e8609897530601f87efedb2b594060678329927","","","","","","High liver fibrosis scores in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease patients are associated with adverse atrial remodeling and atrial fibrillation recurrence following catheter ablation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e8609897530601f87efedb2b594060678329927","","2022"
"1324",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common chronic liver disease, as well as a worldwide medical problem with a substantial socioeconomic burden. In China, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) have been widely utilized as promising and effective therapy options for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a particular kind of medical science reliant on real-world clinical practices and evidence. Therefore, using the real-world data extracted from pragmatic randomized controlled trials (PRCTs) have more reference value for the application of CPMs in NAFLD. Method Six databases were searched from their inception up to March 18, 2022. The methodological quality of the included study was evaluated by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Then, The STATA 13.0 program was then used to do a network meta-analysis (NMA) of real-world studies. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability values were applied to rank the examined treatments. Results Forty-three PRCTs (4997 cases in total) were identified. Da-Huang-Li-Dan capsule (DHLD), Dan-Ning tablet (DN), Dang-Fei-Li-Gan-Ning capsule (DFLGN), Qiang-Gan capsule (QG), and Hua-Zhi-Rou-Gan granule (HZRG) were among the five CPMs tested. As far as the clinical effective rate of the primary outcome index was concerned, the top three CPMs were DN + CDs: OR = 0.19, 95% CIs: 0.12, 0.31 (SUCRA: 81.8%); DFLGN + CDs: OR = 0.21, 95% CIs: 0.09, 0.46 (SUCRA: 74.9%), and DHLD + CDs: OR = 0.26, 95% CIs: 0.10, 0.67 (SUCRA: 61.1%). In terms of liver function index, DN + CDs ranked first in ALT index: MD = 15.81, 95% CIs: 10.05, 21.57 (SUCRA: 85.5%), DFLGN + CDs ranked first in AST index: MD = 14.94, 95% CIs: 4.77, 25.11 (SUCRA: 83.6%), HZRG + CDs ranked first in TC index: MD = 0.53, 95% CIs: 0.28, 1.03 (SUCRA: 87.1%) and TG index: MD = 1.8, 95% CIs: 1.41, 2.30 (SUCRA: 79.9%). Conclusion Using CPMs as a coadjuvant treatment might be positive efficacious intervention from which patients with NAFLD will derive benefits. When it came to the clinical effective rate and other outcomes, DN + CDs demonstrated a significant improvement in individuals with NAFLD.","","","","8bc4e30aead25afc28ec94b31cd7190b1a05fb2a","","","","","","Comparative Efficacy of Chinese Patent Medicines for Clearing Heat and Dampness in the Treatment of NAFLD: A Network Meta-Analysis of Real-World Evidence","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8bc4e30aead25afc28ec94b31cd7190b1a05fb2a","","2022"

Whether these are observed at a population scale, modulated by individuals’ genetics, and confer higher risks of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) are not known. Methods and Results Firstly, using the UK Biobank, the association between adiposity and QTc interval was assessed in participants with a resting 12-lead ECG (n = 23,683), and a polygenic risk score (PRS) was developed to investigate any modulatory effect of genetics. Participants were also categorised into four phenotypes according to the presence (+) or absence (–) of Ob, and if they were metabolically unhealthy (MU+) or not (MU-). QTc was positively associated with body mass index (BMI), body fat (BF), waist:hip ratio (WHR), and hip and waist girths. Individuals’ genetics had no significant modulatory effect on QTc-prolonging effects of increasing adiposity. QTc interval was comparably longer in those with metabolic perturbation without obesity (Ob-MU+) and obesity alone (Ob+MU-) compared with individuals with neither (Ob-MU-), and their co-existence (Ob+MU+) had an additive effect on QTc interval. Secondly, for 502,536 participants in the UK Biobank, odds ratios (ORs) for VA were computed for the four clinical phenotypes above using their past medical records. Referenced to Ob-MU-, ORs for VA in Ob-MU+ men and women were 5.96 (95% CI: 4.70–7.55) and 5.10 (95% CI: 3.34–7.80), respectively. ORs for Ob+MU+ were 6.99 (95% CI: 5.72–8.54) and 3.56 (95% CI: 2.66–4.77) in men and women, respectively. Conclusion Adiposity and metabolic perturbation increase QTc to a similar degree, and their co-existence exerts an additive effect. These effects are not modulated by individuals’ genetics. Metabolic ill-health is associated with a higher OR for VA than obesity.","","","","6f1db4dc8ae81fc67fb7d77f4f09f15c85be03b5","","","","","","Increasing Adiposity Is Associated With QTc Interval Prolongation and Increased Ventricular Arrhythmic Risk in the Context of Metabolic Dysfunction: Results From the UK Biobank","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f1db4dc8ae81fc67fb7d77f4f09f15c85be03b5","","2022"

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the nature and magnitude of the association between NAFLD and hypertension. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for observational studies published up to May 1, 2021. Cohort studies that reported data on the association between NAFLD and incident hypertension or between hypertension and incident NAFLD were included. We used random-effects models to conduct meta-analysis on the measures of association from individual studies. A total of 11 studies were eligible for inclusion, among which 4 studies including 25,260 participants reported the association between hypertension and new-onset NAFLD. The presence of hypertension was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident NAFLD (HR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.41–1.88; I2 = 37.6%). On the other hand, 9 studies with data on 46,487 participants analyzed the effects of NAFLD on incident hypertension. Pooled analysis showed that the presence of NAFLD was significantly associated with an increased incidence of hypertension (HR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.29–1.87; I2 = 80.5%). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies in this analysis (p < 0.01). Sensitivity analyses showed that the magnitude of the association was significantly different in subgroups stratified by a mean age of participants and geographical location, which explains part of the heterogeneity. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates the existence of a bidirectional relationship between NAFLD and hypertension independent of traditional cardiometabolic risk factors.","","","","85586890ee558d1c05c2857a6673e18ead4f83f6","","","","","","Bidirectional Association between Hypertension and NAFLD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85586890ee558d1c05c2857a6673e18ead4f83f6","","2022"

Clark Howell of human skeletal remains from the Middle Pleistocene has always been one of the greatest gaps in human-paleontological knowledge. At THE SPARSE REPRESENTATION first, Southeastern Asia was unique in having provided remains from the Trinil beds in Java, but the signifi­ cance of this poorly preserved skull-cap was confirmed and greatly amplified by subsequent discoveries (Von Koenigswald 1940) of better preserved specimens at other localities of similar age, as well as in the still older Djetis beds. Still tfuly unique in all the world is the somewhat younger occupation site of Locality 1 Choukoutien, with its extraordinarily abundant, prob­ ably cannibalized, human remains in association with hearths, stone implements (Choukoutienian chopper/ chopping-tool complex), and remains of slaughtered animals. For many years, the only such find from the West was the enigmatic human mandible from the Grafenrain gravel pit at Mauer in the Rhineland. Then, within a few years in the mid-thirties, three additional speci­ mens came to light in western Europe (Steinheim), Britain (Swanscombe), and northwest Africa (Rabat, Morocco). In the last several years, further Middle Pleistocene human remains were found in northwest Africa, both in Algeria (Ternifine) and in Morocco (Sidi Abderrahman). All these discoveries (Fig. I) have excellent paleontological associations, and, in three cases (Swanscombe, Ternifine, Sidi Abderrahman), there are associated stone implements (Acheulean of various stages). However, no occupation site is yet F. CLARK HOWELL is Associate Professor of Anthropology, De­ partment of Anthropology, University of Chicago (Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.).

HOWELL has undertaken field and other studies on early man in Europe (1953,1956) and in Africa (1954,1957-58,1959), and made a recent brief visit to Israel (1959). He has published various papers on human paleontology, especially as regards the Neanderthal problem, and on early man and the Pleisto­ cene in general. Prior to submitting the present paper to CURRENT ANTHRO­ POLOGY, HOWELL sent it, for comment and criticism, to three colleagues, of whom W. W. Howells and Kenneth P. Oakley responded.

These human skeletal remains, taken in conjunction with those from the Middle Pleistocene of eastern and southern Asia, have an important bearing on interpre­ tations of the course of human evolution. The signifi­ cance of these discoveries has been obscured by the pre­ occupation of some human paleontologists with other human remains either suspected to be of Pleistocene antiquity or questionable due to an extraordinary com· plex of morphological features (the famous hoax of Piltdown). Largely as a consequence of this, there have grown up two main interpretations of man's phylogeny in the Pleistocene, one depending on the possible im­ portance of the suspicious fossils, and the other de­ pending only on the scanty, but well-dated, human fos­ sils enumerated above. The former interpretation recognizes an early, at least earlier, Middle Pleistocene separation of a morphologically modern (sapiens) lineage. The latter postulates progressive transforma· tion of primitive and variable Middle Pleistocene hu­ man populations into diverse Neanderthal and re­ lated, geographically distinctive, groups, as well as into incipiently sapiens peoples.

In this context, the Somme Valley in northern France offers a route to Britain during various Pleistocene low sea levels, and has provided numerous evidence of Lower Palaeolithic human occupation through fieldwork initiated during the 19th century. These localities are associated with the original definition in the 1930s by the French prehistorian Abbé Henri Breuil of the ‘Abbevillien’ (Abbevillian facies), based on lithic pieces including crudely made bifaces recovered in particular in some famous key localities of Abbeville, Carpentier, Léon and Moulin Quignon quarries. The history of the term and its definition subsequently gave rise to debates concerning the chronocultural framework of Palaeolithic assemblages among the scientific community of prehistorians over time, from Jacques Boucher de Perthes, Gabriel de Mortillet, Geoffroy d'Ault du Mesnil, Victor Commont, Henri Breuil and François Bordes. New investigations at these three localities, all associated with the High Terrace of the Somme system, pushed back the age of the expansion of the Acheulean both in northern France and in Western Europe to c. 670–650 000 years. They imply that early hominins were able to settle in North‐West Europe during both climatic temperate and cold phases. Our work, including new excavations and associated field observations of the three Abbeville localities involved at the onset of the controversy, allows a re‐examination of the Abbevillian and contributes to the discussion of the history of Prehistoric Science and the Earliest ‘Acheuleans’ in North‐West Europe.","","","","e0f37a0e05816449f26a7a7107a62de1a22b6056","","","","","","Reassessment of the ‘Abbevillien’ in the perspective of new discoveries from the Lower Palaeolithic and Quaternary sites of Abbeville (Somme, northern France)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0f37a0e05816449f26a7a7107a62de1a22b6056","","2021"

"1338",":Paper","CC-BY","The Apidima 2 fossil cranium from South Peloponnese is one of the most important hominin specimens from Southeast Europe. Nevertheless, there has been continuous controversy as to whether it represents a so‐called Preneandertal/Homo heidelbergensis such as, for example, the Petralona cranium from Northern Greece or a more derived Neandertal. Recent absolute dating evidence alone cannot clarify the issue because both classifications would be possible during the respective Middle Pleistocene time span. Since only limited data were available on the cranium, there have been repeated claims for the need of a broader comparative study of the hominin. The present article presents a CT‐based virtual reconstruction including corrections of postmortem fractures and deformation as well as detailed metrical and morphological analyses of the specimen. Endocranial capacity could be estimated for the first time based on virtual reconstruction. Our multivariate analyses of metric data from the face and vault revealed close affinities to early and later Neandertals, especially showing the derived facial morphometrics. In addition, comparative analyses of Apidima 2 were done for many derived Neandertal features. Here again, a significant number of Neandertal features could be found in the Apidima cranium but no conditions common in Preneandertals. In agreement with a later Middle Pleistocene age Apidima is currently the earliest evidence of a hominin in Europe with such a derived Neandertal facial morphology. The place of Apidima in the complex process of Neandertal evolution as well as its taxonomic classification are discussed as well.

Here, we focus on one aspect of facial shape and analyze shape variation of the dental arcades of these fossils together with other Homo individuals.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three-dimensional landmark data were collected on computed tomographic scans and surface scans of Middle Pleistocene fossil hominins (n = 8), Homo erectus s.l. (n = 4), Homo antecessor (n = 1), Homo neanderthalensis (n = 13), recent (n = 52) and fossil (n = 19) Homo sapiens. To increase sample size, we used multiple multivariate regression to reconstruct complementary arches for isolated mandibles, and explored size and shape differences among maxillary arcades.


RESULTS
The shape of the dental arcade in H. erectus s.l. and H. antecessor differs markedly from both Neanderthals and H. sapiens. The latter two show subtle but consistent differences in arcade length and width. Shape variation among Middle Pleistocene fossil hominins does not exceed the amount of variation of other species, but includes individuals with more primitive and more derived morphology, all more similar to Neanderthals and H. sapiens than to H. erectus s.l.


DISCUSSION
Although our results cannot reject the hypothesis that the Middle Pleistocene fossil hominins belong to a single species, their shape variation comprises a more primitive morph that represents a likely candidate for the shape of the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and H. sapiens, and a more derived morph resembling Neanderthals. The arcade shape difference between Neanderthals and H. sapiens might be related to different ways to withstand mechanical stress.","","","","35e5c1a368a1ab8c69a93d119c019a2b1b627785","","","","","","Morphological trends in arcade shape and size in Middle Pleistocene Homo.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35e5c1a368a1ab8c69a93d119c019a2b1b627785","","2018"
"1341",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","We here present a comparative study of the Montmaurin-LN Middle Pleistocene mandible (Haute-Garonne, France). This mandible, of which its right and left molar series are preserved in situ, was found in La Niche cave (Montmaurin’s karst system) in 1949, and was first attributed to the ‘Mindel-Riss’ interglacial (= MIS 9 to 11) based on its geological context. Later studies based on geological and faunal evidence have attributed the Montmaurin-LN mandible to MIS 7. Following a detailed morphological and metric comparative study of the mandible in the 1970s, it was interpreted in the light of a still limited fossil record and the prevailing paradigm back then. Waiting for geochronological studies in the forthcoming years, here we review the main morphological and metrical features of this mandible and its molars, which have been reassessed in the framework of a remarkably enlarged Pleistocene fossil record since the mandible was first described, and our current, more in-depth understanding of human evolution in Europe. Using a selection of mandibular features with potential taxonomic signal we have found that the Montmaurin-LN mandible shares only a few derived traits with Neandertals. Our analyses reveal that this mandible is more closely related to the ancient specimens from the African and Eurasian Early and Middle Pleistocene, particularly due to the presence of primitive features of the Homo clade. In contrast, the external morphology of the molars is clearly similar to that of Neandertals. The results are assessed in the light of the present competing hypotheses used to explain the European hominin fossil record.","","","","42cd043d57a530a63146c8a0eca7bd31834c0140","","","","","","A reassessment of the Montmaurin-La Niche mandible (Haute Garonne, France) in the context of European Pleistocene human evolution","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42cd043d57a530a63146c8a0eca7bd31834c0140","","2018"

"1343",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Evolutionary and functional significance of the human chin has long been explored from various perspectives including masticatory biomechanics, speech, and anterior tooth size. Recent ontogenetic studies have indicated that the spatial position of internally forming anterior teeth partially constrains adult mandibular symphyseal morphology. The present study therefore preliminarily examined the size and placement of developing anterior teeth in immature Neanderthal mandibles of Dederiyeh 1 and 2, compared with similarly-aged modern humans (N = 16) and chimpanzees (N = 7) whose incisors are comparatively small and large among extant hominids, respectively. The Dederiyeh 1 mandible is described as slightly presenting a mental trigone and attendant mental fossa, whereas Dederiyeh 2 completely lacks such chin-associated configurations. Results showed that, despite symphyseal size being within the modern human range, both Dederiyeh mandibles accommodated overall larger anterior dentition and displayed a remarkably wide bicanine space compared to those of modern humans. Dederiyeh 2 had comparatively thicker deciduous incisor roots and more enlarged permanent incisor crypts than Dederiyeh 1, but both Dederiyeh individuals exhibited a total dental size mostly intermediate between modern humans and chimpanzees. These findings potentially imply that the large deciduous/permanent incisors collectively distended the labial alveolar bone, obscuring an incipient mental trigone. It is therefore hypothesized that the appearance of chin-associated features, particularly of the mental trigone and fossa, can be accounted for partly by developmental relationships between the sizes of the available mandibular space and anterior teeth. This hypothesis must be, however, further addressed with more referential samples in future studies.","","","","6da9fa4756f0cab7ffb70f1307df496f821af2f9","","","","","","Size and placement of developing anterior teeth in immature Neanderthal mandibles from Dederiyeh Cave, Syria: implications for emergence of the modern human chin.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6da9fa4756f0cab7ffb70f1307df496f821af2f9","","2015"

"1351",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Although the late 17th century witnessed the recognition of fossils as the remains of extinct organisms-because they could be incorporated into the creation story embodied in the Great Chain of Being-acceptance of human antiquity through the indisputable demonstration of the contemporaneity of human bones, stone tools, and accepted fossils was not forthcoming for nearly 2 centuries thereafter. When it did occur, however, ancient humans were not seen as presenting a pattern of diversity similar to that seen in the fossil records of nonhuman organisms. Instead, human evolution then, as now, has typically been interpreted as being unilinear. This belief can be traced to Huxley (1863), who argued that the Feldhofer Grotto Neanderthal skullcap was merely an extension into the past of morphology seen in the Australian Aborigine, whom he took to represent the primitive end of an extreme range of variation he thought characterized Homo sapiens. During the mid-20th century, Mayr and Dobzhansky (mis)used their clout as founders of the evolutionary synthesis to cement in paleoanthropology the idea that human evolutionary history was characterized by nonspeciation. As such, anything that could be interpreted as potentially representing taxic diversity was relegated to the status of individual variation. Lack of understanding of the history of human paleontology, and the biases that constrained its perspective on human evolution, continue to affect the ways in which most paleoanthropologists pigeonhole human fossils.","","","","e2c30af6b162b5a1994a0bf67afa99125b5d42ae","","","","","","Race and the odd history of human paleontology.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2c30af6b162b5a1994a0bf67afa99125b5d42ae","","2006"

"1353",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Our view of H. erectus is vastly different today than when Pithecanthropus erectus was described in 1894. Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records.","","","","ae8842481ae5297a9001a3d865e240f101647e80","","","","","","Natural history of Homo erectus.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae8842481ae5297a9001a3d865e240f101647e80","","2003"
"1354",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Systematic excavations, begun in 1987, at the Valdegoba cave site in northern Spain have yielded the remains of five individuals associated with a Middle Paleolithic stone tool technology and Pleistocene fauna. A fragmentary mandible of an adolescent (VB1), preserving nearly a full set of teeth, exhibits a symphyseal tubercle and slight incurvatio mandibulae anterior on the external symphysis. Both the superior and inferior transverse tori are present on the internal aspect. A second individual (VB2) is represented by a set of ten deciduous teeth consistent with an age at death of 6-9 months. A proximal manual phalanx (VB3) displays a relatively broad head, a characteristic which is found in both Neandertals, as well as European Middle Pleistocene hominids. VB4 is a fourth metatarsal that lacks the distal epiphysis, indicating it comes from an adolescent individual, and has a relatively high robusticity index. Finally, VB5 is a fifth metatarsal of an adult. The VB1 mandible shows a combination of archaic characteristics as well as more specific Neandertal morphological traits. The VB2 deciduous teeth are very small, and both the metrics and morphology seem more consistent with a modern human classification. The postcranial elements are undiagnostic, U-Th dating has provided an age of >350 ka for the base of the sequence and a date of <73.2+/-5 ka for level 7, near the top. Faunal analysis and radiometric dates from other nearby Mousterian sites suggests that the Valdegoba site is correlative with oxygen isotope stages 3-6 on the Iberian peninsula, and an Upper Pleistocene age for the Valdegoba hominids seems most reasonable.","","","","7073181f006adbbf14f615a752b86a2aa56c4c56","","","","","","Human remains from Valdegoba Cave (Huérmeces, Burgos, Spain).","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7073181f006adbbf14f615a752b86a2aa56c4c56","","2001"
"1355",":Paper","CC-BY","Analysis of variation and distribution of evolutionary novelties is meaningful in understanding evolutionary processes. The mandible, as a morphological complex, comprises a large number of derived Neanderthal features. The present study investigates whether the features usually considered as European lineage apomorphies evolved independently; the occurrence of these features is studied in the mandibles from the Sima de los Huesos (SH) site (Atapuerca, Spain). For comparative purposes, a large sample of Neanderthal mandibles as well as older fossil Homo specimens have been used for the study. Chi-square tests were employed to test for independence. The SH mandibles present a set of features that clearly show the basic architecture of the Neanderthal mandible. A highly significant association is detected in the variation of the position of the mental foramen, the lateral prominence, and the anterior marginal tubercle, as well as in the development of retromolar space. However, a much weaker association is detected in the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, with a few exceptions. Features of the external aspect of the mandible occur chronologically earlier than those observed in the internal aspect. The hypothesis that two distinct and consecutive morphological processes have driven the emergence of the European lineage throughout the Middle Pleistocene is proposed. A first transformation affects the mandible by means of backwards displacement of the structures located at the external aspect, as well as the position of the condyle. A second process would modify the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, in which the relief of the masseteric and pterygoid fossae are affected, in association with a spatial rearrangement of the corpus and ramus. Analyzed individually, some of the considered features may be questioned as Neanderthal apomorphies (Trinkaus,1993; Franciscus and Trinkaus, 995); however, the joint occurrence of many of them suggests that the complex is an evolutionary novelty.","","","","72fd2d645ce07ea923c015e9a743790fa11f07ea","","","","","","Occurrence of neanderthal features in mandibles from the Atapuerca-SH site.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72fd2d645ce07ea923c015e9a743790fa11f07ea","","2001"
"1356",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Proponents of the model known as the ""human revolution"" claim that modern human behaviors arose suddenly, and nearly simultaneously, throughout the Old World ca. 40-50 ka. This fundamental behavioral shift is purported to signal a cognitive advance, a possible reorganization of the brain, and the origin of language. Because the earliest modern human fossils, Homo sapiens sensu stricto, are found in Africa and the adjacent region of the Levant at >100 ka, the ""human revolution"" model creates a time lag between the appearance of anatomical modernity and perceived behavioral modernity, and creates the impression that the earliest modern Africans were behaviorally primitive. This view of events stems from a profound Eurocentric bias and a failure to appreciate the depth and breadth of the African archaeological record. In fact, many of the components of the ""human revolution"" claimed to appear at 40-50 ka are found in the African Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the ""human revolution"" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World. The African Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominid fossil record is fairly continuous and in it can be recognized a number of probably distinct species that provide plausible ancestors for H. sapiens. The appearance of Middle Stone Age technology and the first signs of modern behavior coincide with the appearance of fossils that have been attributed to H. helmei, suggesting the behavior of H. helmei is distinct from that of earlier hominid species and quite similar to that of modern people. If on anatomical and behavioral grounds H. helmei is sunk into H. sapiens, the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250-300 ka.","","","","06021515512fc56b41e0b766c92598ee722068de","","","","","","The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06021515512fc56b41e0b766c92598ee722068de","","2000"

The TD6 dental sample consists of two deciduous and 28 permanent teeth, belonging to a minimum of six individuals. Paleomagnetic analyses of the TD sequence suggest an age for the Aurora stratum of greater than 780 ka. The associated fossil macro- and micrommals are consistent with a date for the Atapuerca-TD6 hominids at the end of the Early Pleistocene. As a whole, the size of the TD6 teeth is large and comparable to that of the African Lower Pleistocene hominids. Most morphological dental traits are plesiomorphic for the genus Homo, whereas the shape analysis has revealed some size-related trends that differ from those seen in early Homo. Thus, the relative size increase of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth and buccolingual diameter of the first molars, the reduction of the third molars and lower canines, and the P(3)>P(4)size sequence are all characteristic of the population represented by the TD6 hominids. The morphological evidence suggests that the TD6 hominids are closer to African Lower and early Middle Pleistocene hominids than they are to European Middle Pleistocene hominids. However, some dental traits of the TD6 hominids, such as the expansion of the anterior teeth, the P(3)>P(4)size sequence, and the morphology of the lower canine also suggest an evolutionary continuity between the population represented by these hominids and the European Middle Pleistocene population. Furthermore, dental evidence indicates that the TD6 hominids are clearly distinct from Asian H. erectus. Dental evidence also suggests that the TD6 hominids could represent an evolutionary connection between H. ergaster and H. heidelbergensis.","","","","f78cb16f9993a9ea88696eb071b6a8e38067895a","","","","","","Dental remains from Atapuerca-TD6 (Gran Dolina site, Burgos, Spain).","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f78cb16f9993a9ea88696eb071b6a8e38067895a","","1999"

"1360",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","The recent discovery of unexpectedly ancient human remains has fuelled interest about the first dispersion of Homo outside Africa. The Dmanisi mandible is perhaps one of the most interesting findings, as it supposedly represents one of the oldest hominids outside of Africa. Recently, different interpretations have been published about this specimen. Our comparison of the Dmanisi mandible with a large sample of mandibles and teeth has led us to a new interpretation. In our view, the Dmanisi mandible exhibits a unique combination of traits. Some of its features, taken in isolation, may be attributed to morphological extremes within the genus Homo. The architecture of the mandible as well as the morphology and dimensions of incisors, canines, and P3s are clearly primitive. However, dental traits such as the reduction of the talonid in the P4s and a distally decreasing molar series seems to be derived. Some combinations of these traits are found in specimens of Homo ergaster and differ from those generally present in later hominids. Thus, we propose that the Dmanisi mandible might be taxonomically classified as Homo sp. indet. (aff. ergaster). Furthermore, some aspects of the dentition in Dmanisi display close similarities to Asian Homo erectus. If the 1.8-1.6 Myr dating for the Dmanisi mandible is correct, the differentiation of the Asian branch of the genus Homo could be regarded as a very ancient event.","","","","67b783cbee06496bd19314f9edc88b6e0d083b26","","","","","","On the taxonomic affinities of the Dmanisi mandible (Georgia).","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67b783cbee06496bd19314f9edc88b6e0d083b26","","1998"

Analysis of the modern sample shows that most interspecific variation in vault thickness can be accounted for by variation in body size. Correlation values are moderate to high (r = 0.75-0.98), and all variables exhibit positive allometry. The bone thickness: body mass relationship of modern humans broadly conforms with that of other primates. However, in the distribution of relative thickness throughout the skull, H. sapiens is distinguished by relative thickening of the parietal and extreme relative thinning of the temporal squama. The bone thickness: body mass relationship in the two early hominid species is examined using published mean body weight estimates generated from post-cranial predictor variables. A. africanus exhibits great similarity to modern humans in its relation to the catarrhine regression data and in the distribution of relative thickness throughout the skull. H. erectus also shows a modern human-like pattern in the distribution of its relative thickness; however, its bone thickness: body mass relationship is dissimilar to that displayed by all other taxa, including the other hominid species.

"1363",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","In order to reassess previous hypotheses concerning dental size reduction of the posterior teeth during Pleistocene human evolution, current fossil dental evidence is examined. This evidence includes the large sample of hominid teeth found in recent excavations (1984-1993) in the Sima de los Huesos Middle Pleistocene cave site of the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain). The lower fourth premolars and molars of the Atapuerca hominids, probably older than 300 Kyr, have dimensions similar to those of modern humans. Further, these hominids share the derived state of other features of the posterior teeth with modern humans, such as a similar relative molar size and frequent absence of the hypoconulid, thus suggesting a possible case of parallelism. We believe that dietary changes allowed size reduction of the posterior teeth during the Middle Pleistocene, and the present evidence suggests that the selective pressures that operated on the size variability of these teeth were less restrictive than what is assumed by previous models of dental reduction. Thus, the causal relationship between tooth size decrease and changes in food-preparation techniques during the Pleistocene should be reconsidered. Moreover, the present evidence indicates that the differential reduction of the molars cannot be explained in terms of restriction of available growth space. The molar crown area measurements of a modern human sample were also investigated. The results of this study, as well as previous similar analyses, suggest that a decrease of the rate of cell proliferation, which affected the later-forming crown regions to a greater extent, may be the biological process responsible for the general and differential dental size reduction that occurred during human evolution.","","","","203d8528797a0244dec8c83eab1033fdf502170a","","","","","","Posterior dental size reduction in hominids: the Atapuerca evidence.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/203d8528797a0244dec8c83eab1033fdf502170a","","1995"

While the calvaria shares some anatomical features with Asian Homo erectus specimens, it exhibits a broader suite of morphological and mensural characteristics suggesting affinities with early Homo sapiens fossils from Asia, Europe, and Africa as well as demonstrating that the Narmada calvaria possesses some unique anatomical features, perhaps because the specimen reflects the incoherent classificatory condition of the genus Homo.","","","","b5ddd0e9235b5e44cf12a6efa291d4e855d5fb1c","","","","","","Is the Narmada hominid an Indian Homo erectus?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5ddd0e9235b5e44cf12a6efa291d4e855d5fb1c","","1991"
"1366",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The earliest traces of Homo erectus have been uncovered in eastern Africa, where fossils from the Turkana basin are 1.7 to 1.8 million years in age. Later members of this species reached other parts of the continent, and probably Homo erectus had begun to disperse out of Africa before 1.0 million years ago. One route would have taken archaic people around the eastern Mediterranean, to Europe and southwestern Asia. Assemblages of crude stone tools are found in Europe, although no human bones are known from these Early Pleistocene localities. The spread of Homo erectus eastward into Asia is poorly documented, but it is clear that populations were present in Java at an early date, and the famous caves at Zhoukoudian were inhabited nearly 0.5 million years ago. Throughout this long history, the species seems to have remained stable morphologically. There are few indications of change, and evolutionary continuity with later groups is not readily apparent. Anatomically more advanced fossils from sites in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa provide the most promising links between Homo erectus and other forms of Homo. Perhaps we should look to these regions, rather than to East Asia, for the origin of our own species.","","","","d38e76a4c1418d06d76a1819fb0e6b143b6f329e","","","","","","The Dispersal of Homo erectus from Africa and the Emergence of More Modern Humans","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d38e76a4c1418d06d76a1819fb0e6b143b6f329e","","1991"
"1367",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The subocclusal morphology of 168 permanent mandibular premolars (N = 77) and molars (N = 91) of Plio-Pleistocene hominids has been investigated. The taxonomic allocation of the teeth, which represent at least 46 individuals, was based on nondental evidence. Specimens were allocated to one of two major taxonomic categories, (EAFROB or EAFHOM), East African Homo erectus (EAFHER), or their taxonomic affinity was regarded as 'unknown' (N = 17). Information about the root system was derived from radiography and direct observation. Morphometric data were in the form of nine linear and two angular measurements based on eighteen reference points. Root form was also assessed using a scheme which recognised four classes of root morphology. Data were compared using both univariate and multivariate techniques, including Principal Component and Canonical Variate analysis. Posterior probabilities derived from the latter were used (in a two-taxon design model) to assess the affinities of the 'unknown' specimens. The variation in hominid mandibular premolar root form was interpreted as two morphoclines, based on the presumed primitive condition of the P3 (with mesiobuccal and distal roots, 2R: MB and D) and P4 (with mesial and distal root, 2R: M and D) root systems. One trend apparently leads towards root reduction (i.e. P3 = 1 R; P4 = 1 R), and the other to root elaboration (i.e. P3 and P4 = 2R: M and D). The extreme form of the latter is the 'molarisation' of the premolar roots seen in EAFROB. Despite major differences in root form there was relatively little taxonomic variation in root metrics, except for a more robust distal root system in EAFROB. Molar root form showed little interspecific variation except for M2 in which the roots in EAFROB were larger and more robust, with differences in root height being greater for the distal than for the mesial roots. Root form and metrics enable four of the 'unknown' specimens (KMN-ER 819, 1482, 1483 and 1801) to be tentatively allocated to EAFHOM, and a single specimen, KMN-ER 3731, to EAFROB. Published assessments of the root morphology of the 'robust' australopithecines from Swartkrans suggest that the premolar root form of Australopithecus (Paranthropus) robustus is not obviously intermediate between the presumed ancestral condition, and the 'molarised' mandibular premolar root systems of Australopithecus (Paranthropus) boisei.","","","","ee38ed3cfdd51933162ca28a5b8ddff4775ee960","","","","","","Analysis of the dental morphology of Plio-Pleistocene hominids.

Four individuals were recovered in situ in Beds II to IV, while three more are most probably derived from Bed IV, the Masek Beds and the Lower Ndutu Beds. One specimen is of uncertain provenance. Deposits from which the fossils were collected range from late Lower Pleistocene to Middle Pleistocene in age. Of particular interest are three fragmentary lower jaws, which can be compared to mandibles of Homo erectus known from localities in Northwest Africa and China. Olduvai hominid 22, a nearly complete half mandible with crowns of P3-M2 in place, shares many anatomical features with fossils from Ternifine and Choukoutien. This individual is also similar to a jaw from the Kapthurin Formation west of Lake Baringo, Kenya. How best to interpret these comparisons is not clear, but in view of marked similarities between specimens representing geographically diverse populations from different time periods, it may be unwise to rely on mandibular evidence alone to document the presence of regional lineages.

Two basically conflicting views have prevailed, one asserting that races developed as local variations in a species evolving phyletically over much of the Old World for up to one million years, and the other view holding that present races are local variations on populations recently expanding into most areas and replacing the previous hominid inhabitants, this occurring since the time of the Neanderthals. Both views are based on the same archeological data. Gene frequency data and time-calibrated genetic distance measures have recently been applied to this problem. Here we show that the probable demographic nature of Pleistocene populations has obscured genetic distances to such an extent that they cannot be used to discriminate between the two viewpoints of racial origins. The racial classifications themselves are probably not useful in this context and obscure the question, so that we presently do not have a scientifically valid understanding of racial origins.","","","","290ef247e76f50892d86436c3d63b28f38ae21a1","","","","","","Archeology, population genetics and studies of human racial ancestry.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/290ef247e76f50892d86436c3d63b28f38ae21a1","","1976"

About 50 years later, von Koenigswald found another series of Pithecanthropus remains in the Sangiran area, Central Java (Fig. 1). In the past few years other fossils of Pithecanthropus have been found by villagers in the Sangiran dome area (see Table 1).

"1378",":Paper","CC-BY","The sixth skull cap of Pithecanthropus erectus (or skull V, since the Modjokerto skull has not been given a number) was found in the upper layers of the Trinil beds of Sangiran (Central Java) in 1963, associated with fossils of the Sino-Malayan fauna. No stone tools were discovered in direct association with the find.



The specimen consists of the occipital, both parietals, both temporals, sphenoid fragments, the frontal and the left zygomatic bone. We consider the skull to be a male in his early twenties. The occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal bones demonstrate definite pithecanthropine characteristics, and the cranial capacity is estimated to be 975 cm3.



Of the superstructures, the supraorbital torus is extraodinarily thick, approaching the condition in Australopithecus boisei and Rhodesian man. And the sagittal torus is certainly higher than in skulls I and II, but lower than in skull IV. In addition, the angle between the occipital and nuchal planes is larger than in the previous finds. As revealed by various features, the gap between the robustness of skull IV on one hand, and skulls I, II and III on the other, is bridged by the present find. There is no reasonable taxonomic need to ascribe this specimen to a new species, because it seems to be merely an intrapopulational variant of the same species.



Other skulls of P. erectus suggest that the bregmatic eminence, and hence the vertex, is invariably situated at bregma, but this new skull cap deviates from the pattern. Its pteric regions disclose the anthropoid X and I types. The middle meningeal groove pattern is similar to other Pithecanthropus skulls; however, it betrays a known anomaly in that the main stem is covered for a short distance by a bony plate. The mastoid process is fairly well developed, and is also well pneumatized as in P. pekinensis, with its air cells invading the pronounced supramastoid crest.



The zygomatic bone, the first one recovered of P. erectus, does not show characters of particular importance. In fact, its thickness is in the range of modern man.



We would like to stress that the absence of the cranial base does not necessarily indicate that the specimen must be a poor victim of cannibalism, since the morphology of the base renders it more susceptible to post-mortem natural traumata.","","","","70fe160f6f227658845dbcb504aecaa926105271","","","","","","The sixth skull cap of Pithecanthropus erectus.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70fe160f6f227658845dbcb504aecaa926105271","","1966"
"1379",":Paper","CC-BY","In the course of terrace-morphological studies undertaken in the summer of 1962, geographer Dr. M. Pecsi discovered bones, flint and quartzite flakes, and a hearth embedded in a distinct layer in the travertine quarry near Vertesszollos, Hungary. The Vertesszollos travertine quarry has been known for some time in Hungarian palaeontological literature (Kretzoi 1926-27, 1941b; Schreter 1951) as a formation older than Wiirm glaciation. On a visit we found a distinct occupation site, sealed with a thick travertine shelf, a few insignificant bone fragments, and implements reminiscent of the ""a spicchio"" scraper. Vertesszoll6s lies 50 kilometers west of Budapest and about 15 kilometers south of the Danube (Fig. 1). On the fourth terrace of Atal6r, a rivulet reduced to the size of a brook today, travertine has long been quarried. The travertine cone, about 10-15 meters thick, is 1 of the occurences that appear at several points and different heights along a line of break running northwest-southeast on fluviatile terraces of the central range on the right bank of the Danube, between Tata and Budapest The exact correlation between the travertine and the fourth terrace overlain with loess is under examination. In this area, travertine is quarried rather irregularly, in a continuous system of pits, and at several points at the same time. The straight, somewhat southward-sloping layer, and another 4 meters of scattered traces of the continuous occupation site, can be followed over 13 meters, at 5 meters' depth, between the layers of the wall face running north-south at the southern part of the present quarry area. Excavations carried out in August, 1963, commissioned by the Hungarian National Museum, showed the succession of beds depicted in Figure 2. Uppermost is the present soil layer, sporadically broken by the pits of former travertine quarrying (1). Underneath is a layer, 2-3 meters thick, of grey, porous travertine of uneven thickness, the exact position of which is not fixed owing to the debris stuck to it (2). Underneath is a compact layer of fairly typical yellow loess (3). In the loess, especially in section A, we found mammalian bones and some implements on the base of an obliquely intercalated reddish calcareous mud layer (4). By washing we recovered mammalian bones from the loess base. A compact, continuous, 50-70 centimeter thick travertine shelf lies between the loess and the cultural horizon. The smooth surface of the shelf is clearly separated from the loess, suggesting a deposition discordancy between the 2 layers. The cultural horizon is about in the middle of a 30-50 centimeter thick, greyish calcareous layer (5), and is uniformily 5 centimeters thick (6). At the southern termination (section C), there is a small, cave-like hollow where the travertine shelf ends and the calcareous mud is directly covered with loess. Over it is a fairly wide clearage of rock and, south of the latter, a grey, spongy, fossiliferous travertine. Judging from the deposition circumstances of the calcareous mudculture horizon-loess complex, this part of the travertine is older than the cultural horizon. In a spongy, fossiliferous, older travertine underlying the yellowish-grey calcareous mud, which is interrupted sporadically by 5-10 centimeter thick calcareous intercalations, we found mammalian fauna by washing from 2 layers below the cultural horizon, at levels of 2, 4, and 5 meters respectively. We recovered some implements and bone fragments in section A from loess above the cultural horizon and, north of it, from a similarly higher level layer of reddish calcareous mud. The type of fauna suggests that these implements belong to Mindel IT, but they do not differ from those of the main layer. South of section C, at the level of the occupation site, were some quartzite chips. A final stratigraphy will be obtained only through major planned excavations; but on the basis of similarities to a dwelling place found at Tata (Vertes et al. 1964), it seems that Early Man settled here on a travertine-tettarata base that had remained dry. This presumption is supported by the aquatic origin (water molluscs) of the calcareous mud. The covering travertine shelf and the loess are subsequent aggradations in this basin; the amount of water that was instrumental in the formation of the upper travertine did not wash away the incoherent loess from its position in the basin surrounded by calcareous tuff walls. To get sufficient information on stratigraphical conditions and to collect archaeological and palaeontological material for the determination of the culture and age we excavated for a week, exposing 2-2.5 meters. On the northern part of the profile divided into sections (section A), we both dug up and blasted down to the cultural horizon (a length of 5 meters and a width of 1.5 meters, starting from the surface). This exposed a narrow strip of the site, since the covering layers arched over considerably. Part of the cultural horizon was investigated on the spot, part of it washed in the museum. A sizable number of specimens were collected from several points, of the loess and from the 2 deeper layers of calcareous mud. We collected about 700 quartzite, flint, and chert objects that can be classified in the implement group, nearly 2,000 pieces (3,000 grams) of waste products, a nuimber of mostly indeterminable mammalian bones and teeth, about 2,000 grams of thoroughly 'burnt bone fragments, as well as malacofauna and pollen samples. The material is being examined by a team. Classification of the material exposed by major excavations in The spring of 1964 will take much time, and years might pass before a comprehensive monograph is published. Considering the importance of the Vertesszollos find, we prepared this preliminary report on the most important archaeological and faunal results.","","","","3843ed077f0d941f58536d82ee1808e1086cf9dc","","","","","","Upper Biharian (Intermindel) Pebble-Industry Occupation Site in Western Hungary","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3843ed077f0d941f58536d82ee1808e1086cf9dc","","1965"

"1381",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","By FRANK B. LIVINGSTONE Howell's review of human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene was most thorough and timely; and his detailed outline of the geological contexts of the human fossils was particularly welcome. His article also seems to be ideal for CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY and CA* treatment, since it contains broad interpretations of the evidence, which for this period is quite fragmentary and open to a multiplicity of interpretations. Hence, the complete absence of discussion on this article is disappointing. There may be complete agreement among human paleontologists about the course of human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene; but I am sure this is not so for all physical anthropologists. As a physical anthropologist who is not an expert in human paleontology, I should like to disagree almost entirely with Howell's conclusions. Briefly, the central disagreement concerns the number of different species of hominid which existed contemporaneously in the Middle Pleistocene. Howell concludes there were two species; I insist there was but one. Although this disagreement may seem trivial, particularly in view of the great number of different taxonomies of the Hominidae, its theoretical implications are enormous. On the one hand, I maintain with Mayr (1950) and others that there has been no speciation among the Hominidae, but only phyletic evolution-i.e., different species may have succeeded one another in time, but at any one period of time only one species was extant. According to this viewpoint, the hominid lineage consists of three successive species which are usually called the Australopithecines, Pithecanthropines, and Homo. It should be noted that the term ""speciation"" is used to denote the branching process in evolution: a population speciates when it gives rise to two distinct descendant populations which are separate species. I would maintain that this did not occur in the hominid lineage after the Australopithecine stage. On the other hand, Howell maintains that in the Middle Pleistocene there existed two different hominid lineages of successive species and thus two different species. He places the European finds (Heidelberg, Swanscombe, and Steinheim) in one lineage; and the North African (Ternifine and Sidi Abderraham), Chinese (Choukoutien Lower Cave), and Javan (Trinil, Sangiran) finds in the other. This disagreement rests, as do most scientific arguments, upon what one accepts as evidence either for or against placing fossils into one or two species; and in this case I think the disagreement is between the ""bone-oriented"" scientists on Howell's side and the ""theoryoriented"" ones on mine. The evidence on hand includes the scraps of bones that have been uncovered and the inferences we can make as to the environment and way of life of the organism. By a minute detailed analysis of the Ternifine and Heidelberg mandibles, Howell claims to show differences which are ""fundamental,"" and therefore indicative of two different species. To Howell and most physical anthropologists, a bump here or a centimeter there is conclusive evidence for a specific difference. However, I maintain that according to our theories, assigning these mandibles to different species makes neither ecological nor evolutionary sense, and therefore the morphological evidence is not only inconclusive but should hardly be considered, beyond the fact that the two forms were generally similar and were what we would expect a Middle Pleistocene hominid to be like. I would go even further and maintain that we shall never infer or understand the course of human evolution by comparative anatomy or detailed analyses of the miserable scraps of bone which have been found. Only by considering these scraps as living, kicking animals who thus conform to all the general laws of population ecology and evolution will we ever understand our own ascent or descent. In fairness to Howell, I should point out that his article is certainly not lacking in theory, and he does seem to accept the general proposition that spatial isolation is a necessary prerequisite for speciation among the higher mammals. Given spatial isolation, then the speed at which speciation occurs is, of course, dependent on other factors, particularly the amount of ecological divergence; but Mayr (1949) has estimated that it takes a minimum of several hundred thousand years, or roughly 30,000 human generations. If the diverging populations reestablish contact in the interim, they can mix and become one species, or one can become extinct, or they can occupy different ecological niches and by the phenomenon of character displacement become even more distinct (for a discussion of this concept in relation to the Hominidae, see Brown 1958). It does not seem to me that there was sufficient ime for the Middle Pleistocene hominids to speciate, assuming that both lineages derive from a generalized Australopithecine; and this view seems further justified by the small ecological divergence between them. Howell has shown that his two lineages were spatially isolated, one occupying Europe, and the other inhabiting an area stretching from North Africa to Java. But genetic divergence is partly a function of distance, so that similarity over such a great distance, coupled with diversity over such a short distance, would be very unexpected-particularly if there were no barriers. Howell does attempt to show that Europe was isolated from the rest of the hominid range; but with fluctuations in sea level it was not always isolated, and certainly not for the length of time required for speciation. But what seems to me to be even stronger evidence against speciation and isolation is that the North African and European groups shared the same tool traditions, while a different tradition existed in Asia. In addition to the evidence against speciation, it seems to me that the theory of ""no speciation among the hominids"" renders the entire fossil record more understandable and comprehensible than does any other theory. It relegates to the trashpile of obsolescence many of the old problems of human evolution, and in this way is part of a common trend in science through which questions that were considered legitimate in one decade turn out to be illegitimate in the next. For example, two problems which have continually perplexed the ""hatrack"" school of physical anthropology are: 1) the origin of modern racial differences; and 2) where Homo sapiens evolved and how he became distributed throughout the world in the last years of the Wuirm glaciation. As Coon (1959) has pointed out, the number of migrations required to place all human races","","","","bdc6a955d71671b39340e2fa4d08189d1c9cfa66","","","","","","More on Middle Pleistocene Hominids","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdc6a955d71671b39340e2fa4d08189d1c9cfa66","","1961"

However, due to its high Global Warming Potential (GWP), considerable effort has been undertaken to find eco-friendly replacement gases but without significant success for decades. In the study of alternative gas searching, the large number of candidate alternative gases limits the searching approach by the experiments. And in this work, different prediction models for gas electrical strength proposed by different researchers with their respective advantages are compared and concluded. Moreover, a new efficient model is developed. According to a comprehensive sample set of 73 gas species, different molecular properties are calculated based on the density functional theory. Strong correlations between electrical strength and above predictors are obtained by multiple regression. This model has a low computational cost and can be used for molecular screening of SF6 alternative gas from the point of insulation property. In addition, by studying above predictors with clear physical meaning, it can be helpful to analyze how to make considerable improvements in the electrical strength, which can prompt the process of molecular design of SF6 alternative gases.","","","","3dc90a337a6225af47e56a554fd684ec3caab1c4","","","","","","A New Prediction Model of SF6 Alternative Gases in Electrical Strength","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dc90a337a6225af47e56a554fd684ec3caab1c4","","2019"

Following up the previous proposed linear regression models, this work introduces machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) as the potential approaches to predict the electrical strength and boiling temperature. Based on a series of descriptors derived from the molecular structure of 74 molecules, the performance of three different methods: multiple linear regression, artificial neural network and random forest are compared and assessed in terms of the sensitivity to the sample size, prediction accuracy and stability, and the interpretability of predictors. Considering the available data are limited, random forest shows superior performance with higher robustness and efficiency. The same approaches were applied to the boiling temperature and random forest produced better results as well. Besides, the variable importance ranked by RF improves understanding of the correlation between the molecular properties and electrical strength. It provides important insights to analyze the properties of the SF6 substitutes during the design and synthesis of the new eco-friendly gases in power equipment.","","","","71bcdab97a56e33fb7fd5e72411efa31b86ada75","","","","","","Prediction of the Electrical Strength and Boiling Temperature of the Substitutes for Greenhouse Gas SF₆ Using Neural Network and Random Forest","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71bcdab97a56e33fb7fd5e72411efa31b86ada75","","2020"

 For fault failures of a steam turbine occur frequently and cause huge losses, it is important to identify the fault category. A steam turbine clustering fault diagnosis method based on t-distribution stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed. Firstly, the t-SNE algorithm is used to map high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space, and data clustering is performed in low-dimensional space. Combined with the fault records of the power plant, the fault data and health data of the clustering result are distinguished. Then, the imbalance problem in the data is processed by the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm to obtain the steam turbine characteristic data set with fault labels. Finally, we used the XGBoost to solve this multiclassification problem. In the experiment, the method achieved the best performance with an overall accuracy of 97% and early warning at least two hours in advance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively evaluate the state and make fault warning for power plant equipment.","","","","85c4e398e7ea3ba52ee1eb04e62be3957c2f54aa","","","","","","A Novel Intelligent Method for Fault Diagnosis of Steam Turbines Based on T-SNE and XGBoost","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85c4e398e7ea3ba52ee1eb04e62be3957c2f54aa","","2020"

Cleaning bad data is thus necessary for the situational analysis of a data-based power system. Methods for the identification and modification of bad data based on state estimation may fail to converge in iterative calculations, and yield poor results when the errors are significant. State estimation also involves non-linear computation, which incurs a significant computational overhead and makes it difficult to efficiently handle large volumes of data. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a method for the detection and identification of bad data based on constraints on spatial–temporal correlation. In the spatial domain, we fix the equivalent power balance condition through the topology of the network. In sequential distribution, we establish data constraints based on the similarity of data among temporal sections. We then check the data in combination with the spatial–temporal correlation constraints. The proposed method was applied to an IEEE 14-bus system and a provincial grid, and the results show that it can reliably detect and modify bad data to significantly improve their quality. The proposed approach avoids non-linear calculations, is computationally efficient, and can quickly detect and modify bad data.","","","","30fc3984a01b5a2cb3eafa974ea1fcb30ca2bb26","","","","","","A Method for Cleaning Power Grid Operation Data Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Constraints","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fc3984a01b5a2cb3eafa974ea1fcb30ca2bb26","","2020"

However, there is a huge gap between energy demand and supply due to the rise of different electric products and electric vehicles. Renewable Energy Harvesting (REH) plays a critical role in managing this demand response gap, where energy is generated from various renewable energy resources such as Solar PhotoVoltaic (SPV) and wind energy. Several research works exist in this regard. However, they have not yet been exploited fully. So, this paper proposed AI-RSREH approach, i.e., the AI-empowered Recommender System for REH in residential houses. The main goal of the proposed AI-RSREH approach is to predict energy generation based on SPV accurately, and this study aims to minimize the gap between the actual generation of energy and the predicted energy generation along with a recommender system for SPV installation. An exploratory residential house-wise data analytics is conducted for the demand response gap. AI-RSREH uses a stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict energy generation with a recommender system based on the energy generation prediction result. The obtained results show the efficacy of the proposed approach compared to the existing methods with respect to parameters such as SPV installation in residential houses and prediction accuracy.","","","","b0836b362249494fe2623eb56aca28aaade93cd9","","","","","","AI-Empowered Recommender System for Renewable Energy Harvesting in Smart Grid System","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0836b362249494fe2623eb56aca28aaade93cd9","","2022"

With the assistance of information and communication technology (ICT), the electric grid can increase the performance of the power grid system with smart energy management. On the other hand, with the usage of renewable energy resources (RERs), smart energy storage, and new transmission technologies in the power grid system, various new features such as real-time monitoring, fast restoration, battery displays, automated outage management, etc. have been assimilated into the smart grid. These new features generate more complexity in energy transmission and constitute important challenges like low energy consumption, high energy cost, social welfare, etc. while designing energy trading mechanisms in the smart grid. In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, several scenarios such as micro-grids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are present where energy trading plays an important role. However, in these scenarios, there are energy transmission and distribution, security and privacy, energy consumption, system reliability, the criticality of data delivery, and a few more challenges caused by distrust, non-transparent, and uncertain energy markets. Motivated from these challenges, we present a four-layered architecture of energy trading used in the smart grid. We propose a comprehensive background regarding the main concepts of energy trading and the implication of enabling technologies that manage the energy imbalances in the smart grid. Then, we present a problem taxonomy based on incentive, mathematical, and simulation model-driven approaches, which are widely used to control and maintain the energy trading mechanisms. Based on the findings from the literature, we also present a solution taxonomy with enabling technologies such as Energy Internet, Software-defined networking (SDN), and blockchain.

"1412",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Agile methods focus on high quality, frequent deliveries, and customer and development team communication. Despite emphasizing customer involvement, in practice end users commonly do not participate in the early stages of these methods; instead, other business-related customers represent them in defining end-user needs. As a result, the produced software often does not satisfy the actual users’ needs, and the User Experience (UX) suffers. User-centered design, Design Thinking, and Lean Startup have been combined with agile methods to support defining the problem focused on user needs and producing effective software. Lean Inception (LI) represents a workshop that combines Design Thinking and Lean Startup. However, the effectiveness of problem definition and end-user participation in LIs is little explored. This paper presents a case study addressing this gap, investigating the use of LIs to define the problem and how the participation of end users in this context contributes to the resulting UX. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with customers and end-users of an agile software project using LI. Our analysis suggests that, while LI supports the identification of business goals, more details about user needs and software requirements are needed to support designers and developers in understanding the problem and evaluating its feasibility. We also identified a mischaracterization of user journeys and personas in LIs due to the short time dedicated to their creation, hampering the discussion of relevant UX issues. Finally, we observed that, when end users were present in the early stages, they helped the development team to design software that fits into their routine, improving the UX and increasing its adoption. We qualitatively discuss these issues and gains of directly involving end users and not “proxy” stakeholders in LI’s.","","","","13374dea70d7f976a1e7b65840d603728a674aa6","","","","","","Investigating Problem Definition and End-User Involvement in Agile Projects that Use Lean Inceptions","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13374dea70d7f976a1e7b65840d603728a674aa6","","2021"

"1414",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Context: Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential to software quality. Studies have shown that software engineers often make mistakes, such as insufficient or misunderstood requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to support all the RE phases, especially eliciting requirements. In this context, Design Thinking (DT) is commonly used to deal with these problems. DT aims at bringing quality to software development to achieve users’ needs. It has a set of techniques and methods that can help software engineers properly elicit requirements to achieve this goal. However, in the literature, there are several techniques and selecting an appropriate one is not a trivial task. Some approaches support the selection of techniques, including DTA4RE and Selection Universe. Objective: This paper aims to analyze the performance of these two approaches to selecting DT techniques in terms of accuracy. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment to obtain the data. We have applied quantitative and qualitative analysis to the data. Results: Regarding the quantitative results, we found no significant difference in accuracy between the Universe Selection approaches and the DTA4RE. Regarding the qualitative results, we found that grouping the techniques into categories presented by the Selection Universe allowed us to reduce the search time for the techniques from DT since the approach allowed us to associate the system features with the techniques that can be used. Conclusion: We found that the two approaches satisfactorily supported the selection of DT techniques for various requirements elicitation activities. In the participants’ perception, the selection universe was helpful because the approach is intuitive. Also, the categorization of techniques made it easier to find the appropriate techniques for the proposed scenarios.","","","","9aaeafa82aa89888b88d1b1b413e883703f9037b","","","","","","Evaluating Approaches to Selecting Design Thinking Techniques : Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9aaeafa82aa89888b88d1b1b413e883703f9037b","","2022"

"1416",":Paper","CC-BY","Design Thinking (DT) has been incorporated into software processes by teams from startups to large companies, used in problem exploration fostering innovative solutions, and integrated into agile methods to satisfy the real stakeholders’ needs. DT places the customer needs up-front and helps to empathize with users, examining their behaviors, and producing outcomes focused on users’ demand. A set of techniques, like personas and user journey, can be used to support this human-centered approach. Selecting which technique to use might be challenging since factors such as the application scenario, stakeholder engagement level and previous knowledge of the problem-to-be-solved may vary from case to case. In our previous work we presented a DT session conducted to better understand the need for a recommendation tool, followed by a requirements elicitation activity in which we defined how the tool should work, and an early evaluation of the initial tool low-fidelity prototypes. Inspired by the Design Science Research method, in this article we extend our previous work by furthering what we performed in the tool’s definition process. We included in this work a requirements refining activity through high-level fidelity prototypes, and a requirements validation activity through a questionnaire-based feedback collection with professionals who have experience on the use of DT in software development. Our results show that our proposal offers an useful and easy to use tool to recommend DT techniques with the potential to support those professionals who apply DT in requirements engineering by suggesting techniques that are the best fit to the declared context.","","","","01288719404686d8759a96ff0cef799b92fb22ff","","","","","","A Tool Proposal for Recommending Design Thinking Techniques in Software Development","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01288719404686d8759a96ff0cef799b92fb22ff","","2022"

These “caftor” drugs are mainly metabolized by cytochromes P450 3A, whose enzymatic activity is influenced by environmental factors, and are sensitive to inhibition and induction. Hence, CFTR modulators are characterized by an important interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and are also prone to drug–drug interactions. However, these CFTR modulators are given at standardized dosages, while they meet all criteria for a formal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) program that should be considered in cases of clinical toxicity, less-than-expected clinical response, drug or food interactions, distinct patient subgroups (i.e., pediatrics), and for monitoring short-term adherence.

The role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of caftor drugs in clinical settings has recently been established. The availability of reliable and robust analytical methods for the quantification of IVA, TEZ, and ELX is essential to support dose–concentration–effect studies. We have developed and validated a new liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for the rapid and simultaneous quantification of IVA, TEZ, and ELX from the plasma of CF patients. The method was based on a rapid extraction protocol from 50 μL human plasma and separation on a reversed-phase C-18 HPLC column after the addition of deuterated internal standards. Accurate analyte quantification using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection was then obtained using a Thermofisher Quantiva triple-quadrupole MS coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC. The method has been validated following international (EMA) guidelines for bioanalytical method validation and has been tested on plasma samples from 62 CF patients treated with the three-drug combination IVA/TEZ/ELX, marketed as Kaftrio® or Trikafta®, in steady-state condition. The assay was linear over wide concentration ranges (0.008–12 mg/L) in plasma for IVA, TEZ, and ELX, suitable for a broad range of plasma concentrations, and accurate and reproducible in the absence of matrix effects. The stability of analytes for at least 30 days at room temperature could allow for cost-effective shipment and storage. On the same day of sample collection, a sweat test was evaluated for 26 associated patients’ samples, FEV1 (%) for 58, and BMI was calculated for 62. However, Spearman correlation showed no correlation between Cthrough plasma concentrations of analytes (IVA, TEZ, ELX) and sweat test, FEV1 (%), or BMI. Our method proved to be suitable for TDM and could be helpful in assessing dose–concentration–response correlations in larger studies.","","","","63176aee09c232eddb00773d8a409a8267a773c2","","","","","","Simultaneous Quantification of Ivacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Elexacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Patients’ Plasma by a Novel LC–MS/MS Method","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63176aee09c232eddb00773d8a409a8267a773c2","","2023"

However, it is of great importance to identify potential off-targets of these novel therapies to understand how they affect lung physiology in CF. ABSTRACT Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators improve clinical outcomes with varied efficacies in patients with CF. However, the mutual effects of CFTR modulators and bacterial adaptation, together with antibiotic regimens, can influence clinical outcomes. We evaluated the effects of ivacaftor (IVA), lumacaftor (LUM), tezacaftor, elexacaftor, and a three-modulator combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI), alone or combined with antibiotics, on sequential CF isolates. IVA and ETI showed direct antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus but not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive effects or synergies were observed between the CFTR modulators and antibiotics against both species, independently of adaptation to the CF lung. IVA and LUM were the most effective in potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus, while IVA and ETI enhanced mainly polymyxin activity against P. aeruginosa. Next, we evaluated the effect of P. aeruginosa pneumonia on the pharmacokinetics of IVA in mice. IVA and its metabolites in plasma, lung, and epithelial lining fluid were increased by P. aeruginosa infection. Thus, CFTR modulators can have direct antimicrobial properties and/or enhance antibiotic activity against initial and adapted S. aureus and P. aeruginosa isolates. Furthermore, bacterial infection impacts airway exposure to IVA, potentially affecting its efficacy. Our findings suggest optimizing host- and pathogen-directed therapies to improve efficacy for personalized treatment. IMPORTANCE CFTR modulators have been developed to correct and/or enhance CFTR activity in patients with specific cystic fibrosis (CF) genotypes. However, it is of great importance to identify potential off-targets of these novel therapies to understand how they affect lung physiology in CF. Since bacterial infections are one of the hallmarks of CF lung disease, the effects (if any) of CFTR modulators on bacteria could impact their efficacy. This work highlights a mutual interaction between CFTR modulators and opportunistic bacterial infections; in particular, it shows that (i) CFTR modulators have an antibacterial activity per se and influence antibiotic efficacy, and (ii) bacterial airway infections affect levels of CFTR modulators in the airways. These findings may help optimize host- and pathogen-directed drug regimens to improve the efficacy of personalized treatment.","","","","70cdd8e8272ac905cf928f96940e1ae7fbedc589","","","","","","Mutual Effects of Single and Combined CFTR Modulators and Bacterial Infection in Cystic Fibrosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70cdd8e8272ac905cf928f96940e1ae7fbedc589","","2023"

Antibiotics are the mainstay in the treatment of exacerbations and chronic bacterial infection in CF. Inhaled antibiotics are effective in treating chronic respiratory bacterial infections and eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the respiratory tract, with limited systemic adverse effects. In the past decade, highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have become a new therapy that partially corrects/opens chloride transport in patients with selected CFTR mutations, restoring mucus hydration and improving mucociliary clearance. The recent triple CFTR modulator combination is approved for ∼80–90% of the CF population and significantly reduces pulmonary exacerbations and improves respiratory symptoms and lung function. CFTR modulators have shifted the focus from symptomatic treatment to personalised/precision medicine by targeting genotype-specific CFTR defects. While these are highly effective, they do not fully normalise lung physiology, stop inflammation or resolve chronic lung damage, such as bronchiectasis. The impact of these new drugs on lung health is likely to change the future management of chronic pulmonary infections in people with CF.

The chosen articles constituted four randomized control trials (RCTs), four systematic reviews, and two narrative reviews. The last date for data collection was April 24, 2022. Based on the findings of this review, we concluded that by combining three CFTR modulators, this therapy had outperformed all the currently available medications in terms of improving pulmonary function, reducing exacerbations, and enhancing the quality of life of CF patients. In clinical trials, headache and rash were the most common side effects, and laboratory testing to assess liver function is suggested. Long-term safety and effectiveness must be confirmed by the continued review of real-life patient data. Studies done on triple therapy thus far have been promising. Unfortunately, a small proportion of the CF population remains ineligible for any form of CFTR modulator therapy owing to their type of genetic mutation, and this provides ground for further research in this field.","","","","5b10ba1faa4be79c5499b759be3079a94087bea9","","","","","","Newly Discovered Cutting-Edge Triple Combination Cystic Fibrosis Therapy: A Systematic Review.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b10ba1faa4be79c5499b759be3079a94087bea9","","2022"

This creates a therapeutic challenge to the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to the potential for significant drug–drug interactions (DDIs). However, the population with CF is more at risk of serious illness following COVID‐19 infection and hence it is important to manage the DDI risk and provide treatment options. CYP3A‐mediated DDI of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor was evaluated using a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling approach. Modeling was performed incorporating physiological information and drug‐dependent parameters of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to predict the effect of ritonavir (the CYP3A inhibiting component of the combination) on the pharmacokinetics of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. The elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor models were verified using independent clinical pharmacokinetic and DDI data of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with a range of CYP3A modulators. When ritonavir was administered on Days 1 through 5, the predicted area under the curve (AUC) ratio of ivacaftor (the most sensitive CYP3A substrate) on Day 6 was 9.31, indicating that its metabolism was strongly inhibited. Based on the predicted DDI, the dose of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor should be reduced when coadministered with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir to elexacaftor 200 mg–tezacaftor 100 mg–ivacaftor 150 mg on Days 1 and 5, with delayed resumption of full‐dose elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor on Day 9, considering the residual inhibitory effect of ritonavir as a mechanism‐based inhibitor. The simulation predicts a regimen of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor administered concomitantly with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with CF that will likely decrease the impact of the drug interaction.","","","","99b41aa59ed68551d298e6e715c126e38e36dfc5","","","","","","Physiologically‐Based Pharmacokinetic‐Led Guidance for Patients With Cystic Fibrosis Taking Elexacaftor‐Tezacaftor‐Ivacaftor With Nirmatrelvir‐Ritonavir for the Treatment of COVID‐19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/99b41aa59ed68551d298e6e715c126e38e36dfc5","","2022"

"1433",":Paper","CC-BY","Abstract Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition that is caused by variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. This causes multisystem disease due to dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel at the apical surface of epithelia. Until recently, treatment was directed at managing the downstream effects in affected organs, principally improving airway clearance and treating infection in the lungs and improving malabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Care delivered by multidisciplinary teams has yielded incremental improvements in outcomes. However, the development of small-molecule CFTR modulator drugs over the last decade has heralded a new era of CF therapeutics. Modulators target the underlying defect and improve CFTR function. Either monotherapy or a combination of modulators is used depending on the specific genotype and class of CFTR disease-causing variants that an individual has. Both ivacaftor and the ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor combination have been demonstrated to be associated with clinically very significant benefits in randomised trials and have rapidly been made available as part of standard care in many countries. CFTR modulators represent one of the best examples of precision medicine to date. They are expensive, however, and equity of access to them worldwide remains an issue. Studies and approvals are also ongoing for children under the age of 6 years for ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. Furthermore, no modulators are available for around 10% of the people with CF. In this review, we firstly summarise the genetics, pathophysiology and clinical problems associated with CF. We then discuss the development of CFTR modulators and key clinical trials to support their use along with other potential future therapeutic approaches.","","","","547241446e1ed6b93a469ba57af64efcda209583","","","","","","Precision Medicine Based on CFTR Genotype for People with Cystic Fibrosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/547241446e1ed6b93a469ba57af64efcda209583","","2022"

"1435",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The genetic multisystem condition cystic fibrosis (CF) has seen a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches within the past decade. Since the first clinical descriptions in the 1930s, treatment advances had focused on the downstream consequences of a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel. The discovery of the gene that codes for CFTR and an understanding of the way in which different genetic mutations lead to disruption of normal CFTR function have led to the creation and subsequent licensing of drugs that target this process. This marks an important move towards precision medicine in CF and results from clinical trials and real-world clinical practice have been impressive. In this review we outline how CFTR modulator drugs restore function to the CFTR protein and the progress that is being made in this field. We also describe the real-world impact of CFTR modulators on both pulmonary and multisystem complications of CF and what this will mean for the future of CF care. CFTR modulator drugs target the underlying cellular defect in cystic fibrosis. They have a range of pulmonary and multisystem effects and are leading to a transformation of care for a majority of people with cystic fibrosis. https://bit.ly/3nfEt8i","","","","5446abba2bf08d8ccc308d64d03d1ba70217009f","","","","","","Progress in precision medicine in cystic fibrosis: a focus on CFTR modulator therapy","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5446abba2bf08d8ccc308d64d03d1ba70217009f","","2021"

Finding solutions for rare diseases can be very challenging for physicians and researchers. Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic, autosomal recessive, multisystemic, life-limiting disease does not escape this sad reality. Despite phenomenal progress in our understanding of this disease, treatment remains difficult. Until recently, therapies for CF individuals were focused on symptom management. The discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and its product, a protein present at the apical surface of epithelial cells regulating ion transport, allowed the scientific community to learn about the basic defect in CF and to study potential therapies targeting the dysfunctional protein. In the past few years, promising therapies with the goal to restore CFTR function became available and changed the lives of several CF patients. These medications, called CFTR modulators, aim to correct, potentialize, stabilize or amplify CFTR function. Furthermore, research is ongoing to develop other targeted therapies that could be more efficient and benefit a larger proportion of the CF community. The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of CF genetics and therapies restoring CFTR function, particularly CFTR modulators and gene therapy.","","","","958a5a443de5228128334d14970a5649e39c0409","","","","","","New Therapies to Correct the Cystic Fibrosis Basic Defect","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/958a5a443de5228128334d14970a5649e39c0409","","2021"

These modulators show robust treatment effects at group level in pwCF with specific mutations. The individual effect however, is variable. In this review we will explain reasons for reconsideration of dosing regimens of CFTR modulating therapy in order to improve treatment response and prevent side effects. Since the effect of a drug depends on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties of CFTR modulators will be discussed. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships will be used to gain insight in dosage response and exposure response relationships. To understand the cause of variation in drug exposure, pharmacokinetic properties that may change due to CF disease will be explained. We show that with current insight, there are conceivable situations that give reason for reconsideration of dosing regimens, however many questions need to be unravelled.","","","","bc0665539acd84e229446c859eb134f157465662","","","","","","CFTR Modulators: Does One Dose Fit All?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc0665539acd84e229446c859eb134f157465662","","2021"

Ivacaftor, a small-molecule CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator, was the first medication to treat the underlying cause of CF. Since its approval, real-world clinical experience on the use of ivacaftor has been documented in large registries and smaller studies. Here, we systematically review data from real-world observational studies of ivacaftor treatment in people with CF (pwCF). Searches of MEDLINE and Embase identified 368 publications reporting real-world studies that enrolled six or more pwCF treated with ivacaftor published between January 2012 and September 2019. Overall, 75 publications providing data from 57 unique studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Studies reporting within-group change for pwCF treated with ivacaftor consistently showed improvements in lung function, nutritional parameters, and patient-reported respiratory and sino-nasal symptoms. Benefits were evident as early as 1 month following ivacaftor initiation and were sustained over long-term follow-up. Decreases in pulmonary exacerbations, Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence, and healthcare resource utilization also were reported for up to 66 months following ivacaftor initiation. In studies comparing ivacaftor treatment to modulator untreated comparator groups, clinical benefits similarly were reported as were decreases in mortality, organ-transplantation, and CF-related complications. The safety profile of ivacaftor observed in these real-world studies was consistent with the well-established safety profile based on clinical trial data. Our systematic review of real-world studies shows ivacaftor treatment in pwCF results in highly consistent and sustained clinical benefit in both pulmonary and non-pulmonary outcomes across various geographies, study designs, patient characteristics, and follow-up durations, confirming and expanding upon evidence from clinical trials.","","","","d64bb9828df9aa504bbc1e76390379b58935c7dd","","","","","","Real-World Outcomes of Ivacaftor Treatment in People with Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d64bb9828df9aa504bbc1e76390379b58935c7dd","","2021"
"1440",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","While approximately 2000 mutations have been discovered in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), only a small amount (about 10%) is associated with clinical cystic fibrosis (CF) disease. The discovery of the association between CFTR and the hyperactive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) has raised the question of the influence of ENaC on the clinical CF phenotype. ENaC disturbance contributes to the pathological secretion, and overexpression of one ENaC subunit, the β-unit, can give a CF-like phenotype in mice with normal acting CFTR. The development of ENaC channel modulators is now in progress. Both CFTR and ENaC are located in the cell membrane and are influenced by its lipid configuration. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the interaction of lipids and these proteins in the membranes. Linoleic acid deficiency is the most prevailing lipid abnormality in CF, and linoleic acid is an important constituent of membranes. The influence on sodium excretion by linoleic acid supplementation indicates that lipid-protein interaction is of importance for the clinical pathophysiology in CF. Further studies of this association can imply a simple clinical adjuvant in CF therapy.","","","","2d316c52884abe01159c81d222ba1c19cecb2120","","","","","","Is the ENaC Dysregulation in CF an Effect of Protein-Lipid Interaction in the Membranes?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d316c52884abe01159c81d222ba1c19cecb2120","","2021"

Cerebral (Sco₂) and peripheral tissue (Sto₂) oxygen saturations can be measured using near infra-red spectroscopy. In a project simulating oxygen system failure during high altitude-high opening parachuting (HAHO), Sao₂, Spo₂, Sco₂, and forearm Sto₂ were measured. The aim of the present analysis was to explore the agreement between Sao₂ and the three noninvasive measurements of hypoxemia (Spo₂, Sco₂, and Sto₂).METHODS: Healthy volunteers from the Norwegian Special Operations Commando were studied in a hypobaric chamber as supplemental oxygen was removed at 301 hPa ambient pressure (30,000 ft) and recompressed at 25 hPa · min-1 (1000 ft · min-1) to ground level simulating a HAHO parachute flight. Sao₂ was compared with Spo₂, Sco₂, and Sto₂ in scatterplots and Bland-Altman plots, calculating bias and limits of agreement (LOA).RESULTS: The bias ± LOA were: Sao₂ vs. Spo₂: -5.8% ± 16, Sao₂ vs. Sco₂: -3.4% ± 11, and Sao₂ vs. Sto₂: 17% ± 30. The bias for Sao₂ vs. Spo₂ was dependent on the range of values, and correcting for this with a sloped bias line reduced the LOA to ± 8.2%.DISCUSSION: There were wide limits of agreement between Sao₂ and Spo₂. Sao₂ and Sco₂ agreed better, whereas Sao₂ and forearm Sto₂ had wide LOA. The agreement between Sao₂ and Spo₂ improved when correcting for the underestimation of Spo₂ at low values. There is a poor agreement between Spo₂ and the gold standard Sao₂ during extreme hypobaric hypoxemia.Ottestad W, Kåsin JI, Høiseth LØ.

"1442",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Acute hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is a major physiological threat during high-altitude flight and operations. In military aviation, although hypoxia-related fatalities are rare, incidences are common and are likely underreported. Hypoxia is a reduction in oxygen availability, which can impair brain function and performance of operational and safety-critical tasks. HH occurs at high altitude, due to the reduction in atmospheric oxygen pressure. This physiological state is also partially simulated in normobaric environments for training and research, by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to achieve comparable tissue oxygen saturation [normobaric hypoxia (NH)]. Hypoxia can occur in susceptible individuals below 10,000 ft (3,048 m) in unpressurised aircrafts and at higher altitudes in pressurised environments when life support systems malfunction or due to improper equipment use. Between 10,000 ft and 15,000 ft (4,572 m), brain function is mildly impaired and hypoxic symptoms are common, although both are often difficult to accurately quantify, which may partly be due to the effects of hypocapnia. Above 15,000 ft, brain function exponentially deteriorates with increasing altitude until loss of consciousness. The period of effective and safe performance of operational tasks following exposure to hypoxia is termed the time-of-useful-consciousness (TUC). Recovery of brain function following hypoxia may also lag beyond arterial reoxygenation and could be exacerbated by repeated hypoxic exposures or hyperoxic recovery. This review provides an overview of the basic physiology and implications of hypoxia for military aviation and discusses the utility of hypoxia recognition training.","","","","084a3e54aa542980dc2560713b01144d4674e638","","","","","","Hypoxic Hypoxia and Brain Function in Military Aviation: Basic Physiology and Applied Perspectives","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/084a3e54aa542980dc2560713b01144d4674e638","","2021"

Although there is increasing evidence for its invaluable support at high altitude, some controversy remains, largely due to differences in individual preconditions, evaluation purposes, measurement methods, the use of different devices, and the lacking ability to interpret data correctly. Therefore, this review is aimed at providing information on the functioning of pulse oximeters, appropriate measurement methods and published time courses of pulse oximetry data (peripheral oxygen saturation, (SpO2) and heart rate (HR), recorded at rest and submaximal exercise during exposure to various altitudes. Results: The presented findings from the literature review confirm rather large variations of pulse oximetry measures (SpO2 and HR) during acute exposure and acclimatization to high altitude, related to the varying conditions between studies mentioned above. It turned out that particularly SpO2 levels decrease with acute altitude/hypoxia exposure and partly recover during acclimatization, with an opposite trend of HR. Moreover, the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) was consistently associated with lower SpO2 values compared to individuals free from AMS. Conclusions: The use of finger pulse oximetry at high altitude is considered as a valuable tool in the evaluation of individual acclimatization to high altitude but also to monitor AMS progression and treatment efficacy.","","","","af6b1dacab287350c4cdd4de9f1e2e733f939c7e","","","","","","The Use of Pulse Oximetry in the Assessment of Acclimatization to High Altitude","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af6b1dacab287350c4cdd4de9f1e2e733f939c7e","","2021"

This study is performed with 32 healthy subjects, using the systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) approach. We investigate the intersubject variability of hemodynamic and systemic physiological responses, due to a verbal fluency task (VFT) under colored light exposure (CLE; blue and red). Five and seven different hemodynamic response patterns were detected in the subgroup analysis of the blue and red light exposure, respectively. We also found that arterial oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure were positively correlated with [O2Hb] at the prefrontal cortex during the CLE-VFT independent of the color of light and classification of the subjects. Our study finds that there is substantial intersubject-variability of cerebral hemodynamic responses, which is partially explained by subject-specific systemic physiological changes induced by the CLE-VFT. This means that both subgroup analyses and the additional assessment of systemic physiology are of crucial importance to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the effects of a CLE-VFT on human subjects.","","","","dcb82e7790230dc2bfcb72af741fdd8b49717988","","","","","","Individual Differences in Hemodynamic Responses Measured on the Head Due to a Long-Term Stimulation Involving Colored Light Exposure and a Cognitive Task: A SPA-fNIRS Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb82e7790230dc2bfcb72af741fdd8b49717988","","2021"

The pairing—dubbed happy hypoxia but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia—is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology. This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals. It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia. These mechanisms include the way dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, the way the prevailing carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) blunts the brain’s response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve. Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for patients with hypoxemia free of dyspnea are operating in the dark, placing vulnerable patients with COVID-19 at considerable risk. In conclusion, features of COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.","","","","38570eb0cc685f77cf4a1aa85e79a1288bced13d","","","","","","Why COVID-19 Silent Hypoxemia Is Baffling to Physicians","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38570eb0cc685f77cf4a1aa85e79a1288bced13d","","2020"
"1448",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","INTRODUCTION: A study was performed to evaluate a cockpit flight simulation suite for measuring moderate altitude effects in a limited subject group. Objectives were to determine whether the apparatus can detect subtle deterioration, record physiological processes throughout hypobaric exposure, and assess recovery.METHODS: Eight subjects trained to perform precision instrument control (PICT) flight and unusual attitude recovery (UAR) and completed chamber flights dedicated to the PICT and UAR, respectively. Each flight comprised five epochs, including ground level pressure (GLP), ascent through altitude plateaus at 10,000, 14,000, and 17,500 ft (3050, 4270, and 5338 m), then postexposure recovery. PICT performance was assessed using control error (FSE) and time-out-of-bounds (TOOB) when pilots exited the flight corridor. UARs were assessed using response times needed to initiate correction and to achieve wings-level attitude. Physiological indices included Spo₂, heart rate (HR), end tidal O₂ and CO₂ pressures, and respiration metrics.RESULTS: Seven subjects completed both flights. PICT performance deteriorated at altitude: FSE increased 33% at 17,513 ft and 21% in Recovery vs. GLP. Mean TOOB increased from 11 s at GLP to 60 s in Recovery. UAR effects were less clear, with some evidence of accelerated responses during and after ascent.CONCLUSIONS: The test paradigm was shown to be effective; piloting impairment was detected during and after exposure. Physiological channels recorded a combination of hypoxia, elevated ventilation, and hypocapnia during ascent, followed by respiratory slowing in recovery. Findings indicate precision piloting and respiration are subject to changes during moderate altitude exposure and may remain altered after Spo₂ recovers, and changes may be linked to hypocapnia.Beer J, Morse B, Dart T, Adler S, Sherman P.

Acute exposure protocols have been designed in hypobaric chambers to train aircrews to recognize hypoxia and quickly take corrective actions. The goal of the acute hypoxia test is to know the time of useful consciousness and the minimal arterial oxygen saturation tolerated. Currently, there is no computer system specifically designed to analyze the physiological variables obtained during the test. This paper reports the development and analytical capabilities of a computational tool specially designed for these purposes. The procedure was designed using the Igor Pro 8.01 language, which processes oxygen saturation and heart rate signals. To accomplish this, three functional boards are displayed. The first allows the loading and processing of the data. The second generates graphs that allow for a rapid visual examination to determine the validity of individual records and calculate slopes on selected segments of the recorded signal. Finally, the third can apply filters to generate data groups for analysis. In addition, this tool makes it possible to propose new study variables that are derived from the raw signals and can be applied simultaneously to large data sets. The program can generate graphs accompanied by basic statistical parameters and heat maps that facilitate data visualization. Moreover, there is a possibility of adding other signals during the test, such as the oxygenation level in vital organs, electrocardiogram, or electroencephalogram, which illustrates the test’s excellent potential for application in aerospace medicine and for helping us develop a better understanding of complex physiological phenomena.","","","","01f449f32fd182ead3651968cc487b9dd128db8e","","","","","","An Igor Pro 8.01 Procedure to Analyze Pulse Oximetry during Acute Hypoxia Test in Aircrews","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01f449f32fd182ead3651968cc487b9dd128db8e","","2023"

Materials and methods We selected 30 patients with HACE diagnosed between January 2012 to August 2022 as the experimental group and 60 patients with dizziness on traveling from the plain to the plateau or from lower altitude to higher altitude in a short period of time as the control group. We collected general clinical data from the experimental group and classified it according to clinical symptoms. In both groups, we then performed a head CT and multi-sequence MRI (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, and DWI). Among them, nine patients with HACE were also scanned using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Finally, we analyzed the images. Results According to clinical symptoms, we divided the 30 cases of HACE into 12 mild cases and 18 severe cases. There was no significant difference in sex, age, leukocyte, neutrophil, or glucose content between mild and severe HACE. The sensitivity and specificity of the MRI diagnosis were 100 and 100%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of the CT diagnosis were 23.3 and 100%, respectively. The distribution range of deep and juxtacortical white matter edema was significantly larger in severe HACE than in mild HACE (p < 0.001). The corpus callosum edema distribution range in severe HACE was significantly larger than that in mild HACE (p = 0.001). The ADC value of the splenium of the corpus callosum was significantly lower in severe HACE than in mild HACE (p = 0.049). In mild and severe HACE, the signal intensity of the DWI sequence was significantly higher than that of conventional MRI sequences (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR) (p = 0.008, p = 0.025, respectively). In severe HACE, seven cases showed bilateral corticospinal tract edema at the thalamic level, and SWI showed cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in five cases, especially in the corpus callosum. Conclusions MRI has more advantages than CT in the evaluation of HACE, especially in the DWI sequence. The white matter injury of severe HACE is more severe and extensive, especially in the corpus callosum, and some CMBs and corticospinal tract edema may also appear.","","","","5b8cec3c7edf64cdff5468fc000619466859f020","","","","","","Study of high-altitude cerebral edema using multimodal imaging","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b8cec3c7edf64cdff5468fc000619466859f020","","2023"
"1451",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","In the course of their missions or training, alpinists, but also mountain combat forces and mountain security services, professional miners, aircrew, aircraft and glider pilots and helicopter crews are regularly exposed to altitude without oxygen supplementation. At altitude, humans are exposed to systemic environmental hypoxia induced by the decrease in barometric pressure (<1,013 hPa) which decreases the inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PIO2), while the oxygen fraction is constant (equal to approximately 20.9%). Effects of altitude on humans occur gradually and depend on the duration of exposure and the altitude level. From 1,500 m altitude (response threshold), several adaptive responses offset the effects of hypoxia, involving the respiratory and the cardiovascular systems, and the oxygen transport capacity of the blood. Fatigue and cognitive and sensory disorders are usually observed from 2,500 m (threshold of prolonged hypoxia). Above 3,500 m (the threshold for disorders), the effects are not completely compensated and maladaptive responses occur and individuals develop altitude headache or acute altitude illness [Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)]. The magnitude of effects varies considerably between different physiological systems and exhibits significant inter-individual variability. In addition to comorbidities, the factors of vulnerability are still little known. They can be constitutive (genetic) or circumstantial (sleep deprivation, fatigue, speed of ascent.). In particular, sleep loss, a condition that is often encountered in real-life settings, could have an impact on the physiological and cognitive responses to hypoxia. In this review, we report the current state of knowledge on the impact of sleep loss on responses to environmental hypoxia in humans, with the aim of identifying possible consequences for AMS risk and cognition, as well as the value of behavioral and non-pharmacological countermeasures.","","","","8481f4eb86393a68e2fddc2bed9a5ac841fd9618","","","","","","Sleep loss effects on physiological and cognitive responses to systemic environmental hypoxia","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8481f4eb86393a68e2fddc2bed9a5ac841fd9618","","2022"

We found a higher preference for the riskier bet in the mild hypoxic than normoxic environment but only in the loss domain. Furthermore, as the probability ratio increased, mild hypoxia increased the preference for the riskier bet in the domain of losses but decreased it for gains. The present findings support that mild hypoxia promotes riskier choices in the loss domain and provide new insights into the impact of mild hypoxia in moderating the effect of probability ratio on risky choices.","","","","ff112646c50032bffff5315cbbe3e37983e7ba72","","","","","","Hypoxia and risk preferences: Mild hypoxia impacts choices for low-probability high-payoff bets","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff112646c50032bffff5315cbbe3e37983e7ba72","","2022"
"1455",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","It has been well established that very-high-altitude (>4000 m) environments can affect human cognitive function and brain activity. However, the effects of long-term exposure to moderate altitudes (2000–3000 m) on cognitive function and brain activity are not well understood. In the present cross-sectional study, we utilized an N-back working memory task and resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine the effects of two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude on working memory and resting-state brain activity in 208 college students, compared with a control group at the sea level. The results showed that there was no significant change in spatial working memory performance after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. In contrast, the analysis of resting-state brain activity revealed changes in functional connectivity patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. These results suggest that long-term exposure to moderate altitudes has no observable effect on spatial working memory performance, while significant changes in functional connectivity and brain network properties could possibly occur to compensate for the effects of mild hypoxic environments. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the resting state activity in the PFC associated with working memory in people exposed to moderate altitudes.","","","","46c6bdc5eed10d1cb531eb5456b9eef33bda2281","","","","","","Effects of Long-Term Exposure to 2260 m Altitude on Working Memory and Resting-State Activity in the Prefrontal Cortex: A Large-Sample Cross-Sectional Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46c6bdc5eed10d1cb531eb5456b9eef33bda2281","","2022"

There are variations in individuals’ physiological responses to low partial pressure of oxygen and hypoxia symptoms can vary from one exposure to another. The aim of this study was to evaluate how normobaric hypoxia (NH) affects pilots’ minute ventilation and 10 min afterwards on Instrument Landing System (ILS) flight performance in Hawk simulator during a tactical flight sortie. Methods: Fifteen volunteer fighter pilots from the Finnish Air Force participated in this double blinded, placebo controlled and randomized study. The subjects performed three flights in a tactical Hawk simulator in a randomized order with full flight gear, regulators and masks on. In the middle of the flight without the subjects’ knowledge, 21% (control), 8% or 6% oxygen in nitrogen was turned on. Minute ventilation (VE) was measured before, during NH and after NH. Forehead peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), wireless ECG and subjective symptoms were documented. The flights were conducted so that both subjects and flight instructors were blinded to the gas mixture. The pilots performed tactical maneuvers at simulated altitude of 20,000 ft or 26,000 ft until they recognized the symptoms of hypoxia. Thereafter they performed hypoxia emergency procedures with 100% oxygen and returned to base (RTB). During the ILS approach, flight performance was evaluated. Results: The mean VE increased during NH from 12.9 L/min (21% O2 on the control flight) to 17.8 L/min with 8% oxygen (p < 0.01), and to 21.0 L/min with 6% oxygen (p < 0.01). Ten minutes after combined hyperventilation and hypoxia, the ILS flight performance decreased from 4.4 (control flight) to 4.0 with 8% oxygen (p = 0.16) and to 3.2 with 6% oxygen (p < 0.01). A significant correlation (r = -0.472) was found between the subjects’ VE during 6% oxygen exposure and the ILS flight performance. Discussion: Hyperventilation during NH has a long-lasting and dose-dependent effect on the pilot’s ILS flight performance, even though the hypoxia emergency procedures are executed 10 min earlier. Hyperventilation leads to body loss of carbon dioxide and hypocapnia which may even worsen the hypoxia hangover.","","","","64c505d537f10eb4f573d7fee1f8a18d7660d175","","","","","","Hyperventilation and Hypoxia Hangover During Normobaric Hypoxia Training in Hawk Simulator","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64c505d537f10eb4f573d7fee1f8a18d7660d175","","2022"

Despite significant welfare concerns, carbon dioxide exposure remains the most common killing method, primarily because there is no practical and humane alternative. We explored whether hypobaric hypoxia via gradual decompression could induce a non-recovery state in anesthetized male C57BL/6 and Balb/c laboratory mice. We aimed to determine if this was possible in a feasible timescale with minimal pathological consequences, as a proof-of-principle step. Systematic evaluation of two decompression rates (75, 150 ms−1) and three profile shapes (accelerated, linear, gradual) in a factorial design revealed that hypobaric hypoxia effectively induced a non-recovery state in anesthetized laboratory mice, irrespective of decompression rate and shape. Mice took longer to reach a non-recovery state with the 75 ms−1 decompression rate (75 ms−1: 257 ± 8.96 vs. 150 ms−1: 214 ± 7.26 s), with longer latencies in gradual and linear shaped profiles. Accelerated shaped profiles were least susceptible to meaningful refinement via rate. The only pathological changes of concern were moderate middle ear congestion and hemorrhage. These findings suggest that hypobaric hypoxia has potential, and subsequent work will evaluate the welfare consequences of gradual decompression in conscious mice, to identify decompression profiles that minimize welfare harms associated with ear barotrauma.","","","","19e0c857753713185495d8b3d1b3299923270eec","","","","","","Determining Candidate Hypobaric Hypoxia Profiles for Humane Killing of Laboratory Mice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19e0c857753713185495d8b3d1b3299923270eec","","2022"

Numerous molecular mechanisms affect appropriate acclimatization to hypobaric and/or normobaric hypoxia and curtail the development of HAIs. The understanding of these mechanisms is essential to optimize hypoxic acclimatization for efficient prophylaxis and treatment of HAIs. This review aims to link outcomes of molecular mechanisms to either adverse effects of acute high-altitude/hypoxia exposure or the developing tolerance with acclimatization. After summarizing systemic physiological responses to acute high-altitude exposure, the associated acclimatization, and the epidemiology and pathophysiology of various HAIs, the article focuses on molecular adjustments and maladjustments during acute exposure and acclimatization to high altitude/hypoxia. Pivotal modifying mechanisms include molecular responses orchestrated by transcription factors, most notably hypoxia inducible factors, and reciprocal effects on mitochondrial functions and REDOX homeostasis. In addition, discussed are genetic factors and the resultant proteomic profiles determining these hypoxia-modifying mechanisms culminating in successful high-altitude acclimatization.

The helicopter reached an altitude of 5500 m during flight and descended at different destinations with varying altitudes. At Hotel Everest View at 3820 m, his oxygen saturation was 79%. He had mild tachypnea and deep breathing but was able to walk around, jump, and take photographs. He returned to Kathmandu (altitude, 1324 m) without using any supplemental oxygen during the entire trip. Based on calculations with the alveolar gas equation, he observed that he and his fellow passengers probably had hypoxemia during the trip. In summary, temporary hypoxemia associated with high altitude in healthy individuals without cardiorespiratory compromise may not require oxygen therapy. In contrast, intensive care unit patients who have respiratory failure may have similar oxygen saturation levels but may require oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

Whereas this relationship has been well investigated when acutely exposed to high altitude, potential benefits of acclimatization on SpO2 and related VO2max in healthy and diseased individuals have been much less considered. Therefore, this narrative review was primarily aimed to identify relevant literature reporting altitude-dependent changes in determinants, in particular SpO2, of VO2max and effects of acclimatization in athletes, healthy non-athletes, and patients suffering from cardiovascular, respiratory and/or metabolic diseases. Moreover, focus was set on potential differences with regard to baseline exercise performance, age and sex. Main findings of this review emphasize the close association between individual SpO2 and VO2max, and demonstrate similar altitude effects (acute and during acclimatization) in healthy people and those suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, in patients with ventilatory constrains, i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steep decline in SpO2 and V̇O2max and reduced potential to acclimatize stress the already low exercise performance.

When individuals enter high-altitude areas, they are prone to suffering from acute mountain sickness (AMS) because they cannot tolerate hypoxia. Headache, fatigue, dizziness, and gastrointestinal reactions are the main symptoms of AMS. When these symptoms cannot be effectively alleviated, they can progress to life-threatening high-altitude pulmonary edema or high-altitude cerebral edema. If the risk of AMS can be effectively assessed before people enter high-altitude areas, then the high-risk population can be promptly discouraged from entering the area, or drug intervention can be established in advance to prevent AMS occurrence and avoid serious outcomes. This article reviews recent studies related to the early-warning biological indicators of AMS to provide a new perspective on the prevention of AMS.","","","","11b60341785330211c1668397816de586d069a6a","","","","","","Can acute high-altitude sickness be predicted in advance?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11b60341785330211c1668397816de586d069a6a","","2022"

In order to evaluate the performance of pulse oximeters during rapidly developing short periods of concurrent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, 13 healthy volunteers underwent 3 breathing phases during outdoor experiments (39 phases in total), monitored simultaneously by five different pulse oximeters. A significant incongruity in values displayed by the tested pulse oximeters was observed, even when the accuracy declared by the manufacturers were considered. In 28.2% of breathing phases, the five used devices did not show any congruent values. The longest uninterrupted congruent period formed 74.4% of total recorded time. Moreover, the congruent periods were rarely observed during the critical desaturation phase of the experiment. The time difference between the moments when the first and the last pulse oximeter showed the typical study endpoint values of SpO2 85% and 75% was 32.1 ± 23.6 s and 24.7 ± 19.3 s, respectively. These results suggest that SpO2 might not be a reliable parameter as a study endpoint, or more importantly as a safety limit in outdoor experiments.

Experimental data sets include 296 segments of their total length of 60 hours, recorded on a home exercise bike under different motion conditions. Wearable instruments with oximetric, heart rate, accelerometric, and thermal camera sensors were used to fill the own database of signals recorded with selected sampling frequencies. The proposed methodology includes fundamental signal and image processing methods for signal analysis and machine learning tools for labeling image components and detecting facial temperature changes. Results show the minimal effect of mask wearing on blood oxygen concentration but its substantial influence on the breathing frequency and the heart rate.

This study aims to demonstrate that continuous monitoring of blood oxygen saturation during a maximal exercise test in female athletes is highly correlated with the determination of the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) or anaerobic threshold (AnT). The measurements were performed using a pulse oximeter during a maximum effort test on a treadmill on a population of 27 healthy female athletes. A common behavior of the oxygen saturation evolution during the incremental exercise test characterized by a decrease in saturation before the aerobic threshold (AeT) followed by a second significant drop was observed. Decreases in peripheral oxygen saturation during physical exertion have been related to the athlete’s physical fitness condition. However, this drop should not be a limiting factor in women’s physical performance. We found statistically significant correlations between the maximum oxygen uptake and the appearance of the ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2), the desaturation time, the total test time, and between the desaturation time and the VT2. We observed a relationship between the desaturation time and the VT2 appearance. Indeed, a linear regression model between the desaturation time and the VT2 appearance can predict 80% of the values in our sample. Besides, we suggest that pulse oximetry is a simple, fairly accurate, and non-invasive technique for studying the physical condition of athletes who perform physical exertion.","","","","15761ced0f1581438ee9af64533347b9a98b27c0","","","","","","Oxygen Saturation Behavior by Pulse Oximetry in Female Athletes: Breaking Myths","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15761ced0f1581438ee9af64533347b9a98b27c0","","2021"

In this Outlook paper, we explain why an accurate physiological interpretation of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging signals is facilitated when systemic physiological activity (e.g., cardiorespiratory and autonomic activity) is measured simultaneously by employing systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS). The rationale for SPA-fNIRS is twofold: (i) SPA-fNIRS enables a more complete interpretation and understanding of the fNIRS signals measured at the head since they contain components originating from neurovascular coupling and from systemic physiological sources. The systemic physiology signals measured with SPA-fNIRS can be used for regressing out physiological confounding components in fNIRS signals. Misinterpretations can thus be minimized. (ii) SPA-fNIRS enables to study the embodied brain by linking the brain with the physiological state of the entire body, allowing novel insights into their complex interplay.

The monitoring of this state will be applied in real learning settings to detect and advise on effective break periods. In this study, two functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) wearable devices were employed to build a BCI to automatically detect the state of cognitive fatigue using machine learning algorithms. An experimental procedure was developed to effectively induce cognitive fatigue that included a close-to-real digital lesson and two standard cognitive tasks: Corsi-Block task and a concentration task. Machine learning models were user-tuned to account for the individual dynamics of each participant, reaching classification accuracy scores of around 70.91 ± 13.67 %. We concluded that, although effective for some subjects, the methodology needs to be individually validated before being applied. Moreover, time on task was not a particularly determining factor for classification, i.e., to induce cognitive fatigue. Further research will include other physiological signals and human–computer interaction variables.","","","","dc1fcc9e83f1874783d26ccb1e327826376d7005","","","","","","Automatic Cognitive Fatigue Detection Using Wearable fNIRS and Machine Learning","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc1fcc9e83f1874783d26ccb1e327826376d7005","","2022"

We aimed to investigate the role the activity of the systemic physiology has on individual variations in the fNIRS data. Thirty-two healthy subjects (17 female, 15 male and age: 25.5 ± 4.3 years) were exposed to blue and red light for 9 min (colored light exposure, CLE) while performing a verbal fluency task (VFT). We found that (i), at the group level, the visual cortex showed a stronger deoxyhemoglobin concentration response during blue light exposure than during red light exposure, and (ii) this relationship was influenced by individually different baseline blood pressure values. Furthermore, we found other correlations between changes in fNIRS signals and changes in systemic physiology. Our study demonstrates the usefulness and necessity of the SPA-fNIRS approach to gain insights into the individual variability of hemodynamic responses measured with fNIRS, especially in the case of an intricate experimental paradigm (i.e., CLE-VFT) as used in our study.","","","","ce6128373827df8722f10226495351d943040ed7","","","","","","The Role of Systemic Physiology in Individual Hemodynamic Responses Measured on the Head Due to Long-Term Stimulation Involving Colored Light Exposure and a Cognitive Task: An SPA-fNIRS Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce6128373827df8722f10226495351d943040ed7","","2022"

One of the main issues related to fNIRS applications is the motion artefact removal, since a corrupted physiological signal is not correctly indicative of the underlying biological process. A novel procedure for motion artifact correction for fNIRS signals based on wavelet transform and video tracking developed for infrared thermography (IRT) is presented. In detail, fNIRS and IRT were concurrently recorded and the optodes’ movement was estimated employing a video tracking procedure developed for IRT recordings. The wavelet transform of the fNIRS signal and of the optodes’ movement, together with their wavelet coherence, were computed. Then, the inverse wavelet transform was evaluated for the fNIRS signal excluding the frequency content corresponding to the optdes’ movement and to the coherence in the epochs where they were higher with respect to an established threshold. The method was tested using simulated functional hemodynamic responses added to real resting-state fNIRS recordings corrupted by movement artifacts. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure in eliminating noise, producing results with higher signal to noise ratio with respect to another validated method.","","","","f4e47d1bdc49359b0cd88f2fea806952b632c569","","","","","","A Motion Artifact Correction Procedure for fNIRS Signals Based on Wavelet Transform and Infrared Thermography Video Tracking","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4e47d1bdc49359b0cd88f2fea806952b632c569","","2021"

While an increasing body of fNIRS research in real-world environments is emerging, most fNIRS studies are still conducted in laboratories, and do not incorporate larger movements performed by participants. This study extends fNIRS applications in real-world environments by conducting a single-subject observational study of a yoga practice with considerable movement (Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga) in a participant’s natural environment (their apartment). The results show differences in cognitive load (prefrontal cortex activation) when comparing technically complex postures to relatively simple ones, but also some contrasts with surprisingly little difference. This study explores the boundaries of real-world cognitive load measurements, and contributes to the empirical knowledge base of using fNIRS in realistic settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fNIRS brain imaging recorded during any moving yoga practice. Future work with fNIRS should take advantage of this by accomplishing studies with considerable real-world movement.","","","","0b9b4e5944e11e8961d40a83c72c97d723f54933","","","","","","Real-World fNIRS Brain Activity Measurements during Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b9b4e5944e11e8961d40a83c72c97d723f54933","","2021"

"1485",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background In March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 a pandemic and a major global public health emergency. Mortality from COVID-19 is rapidly increasing globally, with acute respiratory failure as the predominant cause of death. Many patients experience severe hypoxia and life-threatening respiratory failure often requiring mechanical ventilation. To increase safety margins during emergency anaesthesia and rapid sequence intubation (RSI), patients are preoxygenated with a closed facemask with high-flow oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Due to the high shunt fraction of deoxygenated blood through the lungs frequently described in COVID-19 however, these measures may be insufficient to avoid harmful hypoxemia. Preoxygenation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) potentially reduces the shunt fraction and may thus allow for the necessary margins of safety during RSI. Methods and design The INOCOV protocol describes a phase II pharmacological trial of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) as an adjunct to standard of care with medical oxygen in initial airway and ventilation management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 in acute respiratory failure. The trial is parallel two-arm, randomized, controlled, blinded trial. The primary outcome measure is the change in oxygen saturation (SpO2), and the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change in SpO2 following initiation of iNO.

Materials and Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study on patients requiring prehospital intervention between 11 March 2020 and 4 May 2020. All adult patients in whom a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was suspected by the prehospital physician were included. Patients who presented a prehospital confounding respiratory diagnosis and those who were not eligible for ICU admission were excluded. The main exposure was “Low SpO2” defined as a value < 90%. The primary outcome was 48-h ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were 48-h mortality and 30-day mortality. We analyzed the association between low SpO2 and ICU admission or mortality with univariable and multivariable regression models. Results: A total of 145 patients were included. A total of 41 (28.3%) patients had a low prehospital SpO2 and 21 (14.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU during the first 48 h. Low SpO2 was associated with an increase in ICU admission (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2–10.0), which remained significant after adjusting for sex and age (aOR = 5.2, 95% CI = 1.8–15.4). Mortality was higher in low SpO2 patients at 48 h (OR = 7.1 95% CI 1.3–38.3) and at 30 days (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4–10.7). Conclusions: In our physician-staffed prehospital system, first low prehospital SpO2 values were associated with a higher risk of ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","","","d33fdc90eaec19cf427f6095161af7ff62306436","","","","","","Association between Prehospital Hypoxemia and Admission to Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d33fdc90eaec19cf427f6095161af7ff62306436","","2021"

"1490",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","The role of hypoxia, vascular endothelial injury, and thrombotic inflammation in worsening COVID-19 symptoms has been generally recognized. Damaged vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in forming in situ thrombosis, pulmonary dysfunction, and hypoxemia. Thrombotic inflammation can further aggravate local vascular endothelial injury and affect ventilation and blood flow ratio. According to the results of many studies, obesity is an independent risk factor for a variety of severe respiratory diseases and contributes to high mechanical ventilation rate, high mortality, and slow recovery in COVID-19 patients. This review will explore the mechanisms by which obesity may aggravate the acute phase of COVID-19 and delay long COVID recovery by affecting hypoxia, vascular endothelial injury, and thrombotic inflammation. A systematic search of PubMed database was conducted for papers published since January 2020, using the medical subject headings of “COVID-19” and “long COVID” combined with the following keywords: “obesity,” “thrombosis,” “endothelial injury,” “inflammation,” “hypoxia,” “treatment,” and “anticoagulation.” In patients with obesity, the accumulation of central fat restricts the expansion of alveoli, exacerbating the pulmonary dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion, inflammatory damage, and lung edema. Abnormal fat secretion and immune impairment further aggravate the original tissue damage and inflammation diffusion. Obesity weakens baseline vascular endothelium function leading to an early injury and pre-thrombotic state after infection. Enhanced procoagulant activity and microthrombi promote early obstruction of the vascular. Obesity also prolongs the duration of symptoms and increases the risk of sequelae after hospital discharge. Persistent viral presence, long-term inflammation, microclots, and hypoxia may contribute to the development of persistent symptoms, suggesting that patients with obesity are uniquely susceptible to long COVID. Early interventions, including supplemental oxygen, comprehensive antithrombotic therapy, and anti-inflammatory drugs, show effectiveness in many studies in the prevention of serious hypoxia, thromboembolic events, and systemic inflammation, and are therefore recommended to reduce intensive care unit admission, mortality, and sequelae.","","","","2609b49b0f939ce3015d70070187ec78901c8707","","","","","","The intersection of obesity and (long) COVID-19: Hypoxia, thrombotic inflammation, and vascular endothelial injury","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2609b49b0f939ce3015d70070187ec78901c8707","","2023"

We aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of PPT in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods In this randomised, single-blind, controlled trial, we enrolled hospitalized, non-intubated patients (18 to 75 years with oxygen saturation (Spo2) in free-air breathing ≤90%) with COVID-19 pneumonia at a referral hospital. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PPT (six sessions PPT with breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques) or basic care. The primary outcomes were venous blood O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2) pressures, Spo2, and three-minute walking test (3MWT) that were assessed before and end of sixth session. Secondary outcomes included level of dyspnea, venous blood PH, one-month mortality, three-month mortality and short form-36 (SF-36) after one and three months. The assessor was blinded to the assignment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04357340). Findings In April-May 2020, 40 participants were randomly assigned to PPT or basic care groups. While at the end of intervention, pO2 (adjusted mean difference to baseline measure (AMD) 6.43 mmHg [95%CI 2.8, 10.07], P<0.01), Spo2 (AMD 4.43% [95%CI 2.04, 6.83], P = 0.0011), and 3MTW (AMD 91.44 m [95%CI 68.88, 113.99], P<0.01) were higher in PPT group and basic care group, pCO2 was not improved (AMD -2.1 mmHg [95%CI-6.36, 2.21], P = 0.33). Based on the logistic model adjusted to baseline Spo2, the risks of mortality were reduced 81% ([95%CI: 97% reduction to 30% increase], P = .09) and 84% ([95%CI 74% reduction to 5% increase], P = .06) at one-month and three-month, respectively. There were no significant differences in most SF-36 domains scores after one and three months. No serious adverse event was observed during PPT sessions. Conclusion Early PPT can be considered a safe and relatively effective therapeutic choice for patients with severe COVID-19.","","","","bf19e4d43964c63347e98d3911d0829f1470bc62","","","","","","Safety and efficacy of pulmonary physiotherapy in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (PPTCOVID study): A prospective, randomised, single-blind, controlled trial","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf19e4d43964c63347e98d3911d0829f1470bc62","","2023"

As many studies showed conflicting results regarding the use of Non-invasive ventilation in COVID-19-associated ARDS, no unquestionable indications by operational guidelines were reported. The aim of this study was to estimate the use and success rate of Helmet (h) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in COVID-19-associated ARDS in medical regular wards patients and describe the predictive risk factors for its use and failure. In our monocentric retrospective observational study, we included patients admitted for COVID-19 in medical regular wards. hCPAP was delivered when supplemental conventional or high-flow nasal oxygen failed to achieve respiratory targets. The primary outcomes were hCPAP use and failure rate (including the need to use Bilevel (BL) PAP or oro-tracheal intubation (OTI) and death during ventilation). The secondary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death and OTI. We computed a score derived from the factors independently associated with hCPAP failure. Out of 701 patients admitted with COVID-19 symptoms, 295 were diagnosed with ARDS caused by COVID-19 and treated with hCPAP. Factors associated with the need for hCPAP use were the PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 270, IL-6 serum levels over 46 pg/mL, AST > 33 U/L, and LDH > 570 U/L; age > 78 years and neuropsychiatric conditions were associated with lower use of hCPAP. Failure of hCPAP occurred in 125 patients and was associated with male sex, polypharmacotherapy (at least three medications), platelet count < 180 × 109/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 240. The computed hCPAP-f Score, ranging from 0 to 11.5 points, had an AUC of 0.74 in predicting hCPAP failure (significantly superior to Call Score), and 0.73 for the secondary outcome (non-inferior to IL-6 serum levels). In conclusion, hCPAP was widely used in patients with COVID-19 symptoms admitted to medical regular wards and developing ARDS, with a low OTI rate. A score computed combining male sex, multi-pharmacotherapy, low platelet count, and low PaO2/FiO2 was able to predict hCPAP failure in hospitalized patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19.","","","","074c268f12a8c47ab63b666828b6c676999b8d38","","","","","","Clinical and Personal Predictors of Helmet-CPAP Use and Failure in Patients Firstly Admitted to Regular Medical Wards with COVID-19-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (hCPAP-f Study)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/074c268f12a8c47ab63b666828b6c676999b8d38","","2023"

Recent findings Many home oxygen monitoring programmes were established around the world during the pandemic, mostly in high-income countries to support early detection of hypoxaemia and/or early hospital discharge. The characteristics of these programmes vary widely in the type of monitoring (self-monitoring or clinician-monitoring) and the patient risk groups targeted. There is a lack of evidence for benefits on clinical outcomes, including mortality, and on reductions in healthcare utilisation or cost-effectiveness, but programmes are viewed positively by patients.

"1498",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","As the world progressively recovers from the acute stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we may be facing new challenges regarding the long-term consequences of COVID-19. Accumulating evidence suggests that pulmonary vascular thickening may be specifically associated with COVID-19, implying a potential tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) virus for the pulmonary vasculature. Genetic alterations that may influence the severity of COVID-19 are similar to genetic drivers of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The pathobiology of the COVID-19-induced pulmonary vasculopathy shares many features (such as medial hypertrophy and smooth muscle cell proliferation) with that of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, the presence of microthrombi in the lung vessels of individuals with COVID-19 during the acute phase, may predispose these subjects to the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. These similarities raise the intriguing question of whether pulmonary hypertension (PH) may be a long-term sequela of SARS-COV-2 infection. Accumulating evidence indeed support the notion that SARS-COV-2 infection is indeed a risk factor for persistent pulmonary vascular defects and subsequent PH development, and this could become a major public health issue in the future given the large number of individuals infected by SARS-COV-2 worldwide. Long-term studies assessing the risk of developing chronic pulmonary vascular lesions following COVID-19 infection is of great interest for both basic and clinical research and may inform on the best long-term management of survivors.","","","","d7731e51c8cd9c8393ac5187289ea4bc5bad573c","","","","","","From acute SARS-CoV-2 infection to pulmonary hypertension","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7731e51c8cd9c8393ac5187289ea4bc5bad573c","","2022"

INTERVENTIONS: Periods of APP and semirecumbent position (SRP) were randomly applied for 2 hours and separated by a 2-hour washout period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial blood gases, end-tidal CO2. and esophageal pressure were recorded prior to and at the end of each period. Inspiratory muscle effort was assessed by measuring the esophageal pressure swing (∆PES) and the simplified esophageal pressure–time product (sPTPES). The other endpoints included physiologic dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and the transpulmonary pressure swing. The APP increased the Pao2/Fio2 from 84 Torr (61–137 Torr) to 208 Torr (114–226 Torr) (p = 0.0007) and decreased both the VD/VT and the respiratory rate from 0.54 (0.47–0.57) to 0.49 (0.45–0.53) (p = 0.012) and from 26 breaths/min (21–30 breaths/min) to 21 breaths/min (19–22 breaths/min), respectively (p = 0.002). These variables remained unchanged during the SRP. The ∆PES and sPTPES per breath were unaffected by the position. However, the APP reduced the sPTPES per minute from 225 cm H2O.s.m–1 (176–332 cm H2O.s.m–1) to 174 cm H2O.s.m–1 (161–254 cm H2O.s.m–1) (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: In spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19–associated AHRF supported by high-flow nasal oxygen, the APP improves oxygenation and reduces the physiologic dead space, respiratory rate, and work of breathing per minute.","","","","dc2a674a6461d56eb5fae6ae7d4bd1e498b263d7","","","","","","Physiologic Effects of the Awake Prone Position Combined With High-Flow Nasal Oxygen on Gas Exchange and Work of Breathing in Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Randomized Crossover Trial","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc2a674a6461d56eb5fae6ae7d4bd1e498b263d7","","2022"

"1503",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic increase in acutely ill patients presenting to hospitals with life-threatening acute respiratory disease. There was an immediate need for effective triage systems to facilitate clinical decision making. This review assesses the performance of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) in two contexts. Firstly, the ability to detect acute illness severity and likely clinical deterioration in patients presenting to hospitals with COVID-19. Secondly, the use of NEWS2 in the longitudinal monitoring to detect acute clinical deterioration in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. NEWS2 appeared to be at least comparable and, often, superior to other scoring systems (such as qSOFA and CURB-65), and provided an earlier alert of deterioration. A NEWS2 of 5 had high short-term sensitivity within and was unlikely to miss patients with COVID-19 who go on to deteriorate, but this comes with moderate specificity. However, the specificity of these systems is likely underestimated because preventing deterioration is their purpose.NEWS2 is an adjunct to clinical decision making and has served that purpose during the COVID-19 pandemic, playing an important role in communicating illness severity, clinical deterioration, triaging patients to appropriate levels of care and prompting completion of treatment escalation plans for those with high scores and at imminent risk of deterioration.","","","","45a9cadce5abee8c36ee9fbc68d59016bd377153","","","","","","Evaluation of the utility of NEWS2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45a9cadce5abee8c36ee9fbc68d59016bd377153","","2022"

"1506",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","ABSTRACT Some chronic respiratory diseases can cause hypoxemia and, in such cases, long-term home oxygen therapy (LTOT) is indicated as a treatment option primarily to improve patient quality of life and life expectancy. Home oxygen has been used for more than 70 years, and support for LTOT is based on two studies from the 1980s that demonstrated that oxygen use improves survival in patients with COPD. There is evidence that LTOT has other beneficial effects such as improved cognitive function, improved exercise capacity, and reduced hospitalizations. LTOT is indicated in other respiratory diseases that cause hypoxemia, on the basis of the same criteria as those used for COPD. There has been an increase in the use of LTOT, probably because of increased life expectancy and a higher prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, as well as greater availability of LTOT in the health care system. The first Brazilian Thoracic Association consensus statement on LTOT was published in 2000. Twenty-two years later, we present this updated version. This document is a nonsystematic review of the literature, conducted by pulmonologists who evaluated scientific evidence and international guidelines on LTOT in the various diseases that cause hypoxemia and in specific situations (i.e., exercise, sleep, and air travel). These recommendations, produced with a view to clinical practice, contain several charts with information on indications for LTOT, oxygen sources, accessories, strategies for improved efficiency and effectiveness, and recommendations for the safe use of LTOT, as well as a LTOT prescribing model.","","","","ab7d1a5e7082c82fce6e760729908bba95d18fef","","","","","","2022 Brazilian Thoracic Association recommendations for long-term home oxygen therapy","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab7d1a5e7082c82fce6e760729908bba95d18fef","","2022"

The presence of diabetes plays an important role in the severity of the infection, and a rise in newly diagnosed diabetes cases has been identified. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of new-onset diabetes (NOD) and predictive factors with their cut-off values for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. All patients (n = 219) hospitalized for COVID-19 during three consecutive months were included. NOD was diagnosed in 26.48% of patients. The severity of the infection, hospital admission values for fasting plasma glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the peak values for leucocytes, neutrophils, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and the need for care in the intensive care unit were predictors for the occurrence of NOD in univariate analysis, while only LDH level remained a significant predictor in the multivariable analysis. In conclusion, the results of the study showed a high incidence of NOD in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and identified LDH levels at hospital admission as a significant predictor of NOD during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the persistence of NOD after the COVID-19 infection is not known, therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution.","","","","48110490eff507d69f484325ba0bf46c89c96b28","","","","","","Predictors of New-Onset Diabetes in Hospitalized Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48110490eff507d69f484325ba0bf46c89c96b28","","2022"
"1508",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Background Post mortem examination of lung and heart tissue has been vital to developing an understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology; however studies to date have almost uniformly used tissue obtained from hospital-based deaths where individuals have been exposed to major medical and pharmacological interventions. Methods In this study we investigated patterns of lung and heart injury from 46 community-based, pre-hospital COVID-19-attributable deaths who underwent autopsy. Results The cohort comprised 22 females and 24 males, median age 64 years (range 19–91) at time of death with illness duration range 0–23 days. Comorbidities associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 included obesity (body mass index >30 kg·m−2) in 19 out of 46 cases (41.3%). Diffuse alveolar damage in its early exudative phase was the most common pattern of lung injury; however significant heterogeneity was identified with bronchopneumonia, pulmonary oedema consistent with acute cardiac failure, pulmonary thromboembolism and microthrombosis also identified and often in overlapping patterns. Review of clinical records and next of kin accounts suggested a combination of unexpectedly low symptom burden, rapidly progressive disease and psychosocial factors may have contributed to a failure of hospital presentation prior to death. Conclusions Identifying such advanced acute lung injury in community-based deaths is extremely unusual and raises the question why some with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis were not hospitalised. Multiple factors including low symptom burden, rapidly progressive disease trajectories and psychosocial factors provide possible explanations. Heterogeneous, overlapping and severe cardiopulmonary histopathological states occur following #COVID19 deaths in the community. Explanations for this were previously lacking and include unsensed hypoxaemia, rapid progression and psychosocial factors https://bit.ly/3CkEiij","","","","725192e3952a44318b767bed0de2ca3827756177","","","","","","The trajectory of COVID-19 cardiopulmonary disease: insights from an autopsy study of community-based, pre-hospital deaths","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/725192e3952a44318b767bed0de2ca3827756177","","2022"
"1509",":Paper","CC-BY","Background and Aims: A major limitation to providing oxygen therapy by high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) delivery devices is its availability and therefore as an alternative many clinicians use a standard non rebreathing face mask (NRBM) in order to oxygenate their patients where low-flow nasal oxygen or simple facemask oxygen is not providing adequate respiratory support to achieve the target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). We aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness of HFNO versus NRBM in terms of improving patient outcome among patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: In this prospective open labelled study, 122 COVID-19 patients presenting with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) were randomised to receive either HFNO or NRBM to achieve the target SpO2. The primary clinical outcome measured was device failure rate and secondary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality rate. Results: The device failure rate was significantly higher in HFNO group (39% versus 21%, P = 0.030). Oxygen support with NRBM resulted in a reduced all mortality rate over HFNO (26.2% versus 45%) but the mortality rate after treatment failure in either group (HFNO or NRBM) remained high (91% versus 92%). Conclusion: Oxygen support with NRBM results in both reduced device failure rate and higher survival among patients of COVID-19 with AHRF.","","","","c2c68e4abca0ea30d742f7daeb2ebfa4f87a77c0","","","","","","A randomised controlled trial of high-flow nasal oxygen versus non-rebreathing oxygen face mask therapy in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2c68e4abca0ea30d742f7daeb2ebfa4f87a77c0","","2022"

"1511",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide. However, one epidemiological report has claimed a lower incidence of the disease in people living at high altitude (>2,500 m), proposing the hypothesis that adaptation to hypoxia may prove to be advantageous with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This publication was initially greeted with skepticism, because social, genetic, or environmental parametric variables could underlie a difference in susceptibility to the virus for people living in chronic hypobaric hypoxia atmospheres. Moreover, in some patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, early post-infection ‘happy hypoxia” requires immediate ventilation, since it is associated with poor clinical outcome. If, however, we accept to consider the hypothesis according to which the adaptation to hypoxia may prove to be advantageous with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection, identification of the molecular rational behind it is needed. Among several possibilities, HIF-1 regulation appears to be a molecular hub from which different signaling pathways linking hypoxia and COVID-19 are controlled. Interestingly, HIF-1α was reported to inhibit the infection of lung cells by SARS-CoV-2 by reducing ACE2 viral receptor expression. Moreover, an association of the rs11549465 variant of HIF-1α with COVID-19 susceptibility was recently discovered. Here, we review the evidence for a link between HIF-1α, ACE2 and AT1R expression, and the incidence/severity of COVID-19. We highlight the central role played by the HIF-1α signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.","","","","3ca58970c08852e01712feb13241b4eaa80165db","","","","","","The impact of COVID-19 on populations living at high altitude: Role of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) signaling pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ca58970c08852e01712feb13241b4eaa80165db","","2022"

Given the increased respiratory work of these patients, it is necessary to evaluate their actual breathing efforts. The aim of this study is to report the incidence and determinants of increased effort of breathing (EOB) in critical COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU during the year of 2020. Respiratory rate (RR) was chosen as an indicator of EOB. The cut-off value was set at more than 20 breaths per minute. ROC-AUC analysis was performed to identify the accuracy of the PaO2 and PaCO2 to determine increased EOB. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis was performed to reveal the determinants of increased EOB. Results: 213 patients were included in the study. Mean RR in the population was 24.20 ± 6.28. 138 (64.8%) of the patients had increased EOB. The ROC-AUC analysis revealed the PaO2 (0.656 (CI 95%: 0.579–0.734, p < 0.001) as more accurate predictor of EOB than PaCO2 (0.584 (CI 95%: 0.505–0.662, p = 0.043).

COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, is a highly contagious respiratory disease transmissible mainly via close contact and respiratory droplets which can result in severe, life-threatening respiratory pathologies. It is understood that glutathione, a naturally occurring antioxidant known for its role in immune response and cellular detoxification, is the target of various proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors resulting in the infection, replication, and production of reactive oxygen species. This leads to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 and increased susceptibility to other illnesses such as tuberculosis. The emergence of vaccines against COVID-19, usage of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for infection, and implementation of pharmaceutical drugs have been effective methods for preventing and treating symptoms. However, with the mutating nature of the virus, other treatment modalities have been in research. With its role in antiviral defense and immune response, glutathione has been heavily explored in regard to COVID-19. Glutathione has demonstrated protective effects on inflammation and downregulation of reactive oxygen species, thereby resulting in less severe symptoms of COVID-19 infection and warranting the discussion of glutathione as a treatment mechanism.","","","","5e16aecfd015494b81f7297de341880cedcd8426","","","","","","Recent Developments in the Understanding of Immunity, Pathogenesis and Management of COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e16aecfd015494b81f7297de341880cedcd8426","","2022"

"1518",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background The clinical presentation of COVID-19 suggests altered breathing control - tachypnoea, relative lack of dyspnoea, and often a discrepancy between severity of clinical and radiological findings. Few studies characterize and analyse the contribution of breathing drivers and their ventilatory and perceptual responses. Aim To establish the prevalence of inappropriate ventilatory and perceptual response in COVID-19, by characterizing the relationships between respiratory rate (RR), dyspnoea and arterial blood gas (ABG) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients at presentation to hospital, and their post-Covid respiratory sequelae at follow-up. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study including consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020. In those with concurrent ABG, RR and documented dyspnoea status on presentation, we documented patient characteristics, disease severity, and outcomes at hospital and 6-week post-discharge. Results Of 492 admissions, 194 patients met the inclusion criteria. Tachypnoea was present in 75% pronounced (RR>30) in 36%, and persisted during sleep. RR correlated with heart rate (HR) (r = 0.2674), temperature (r = 0.2824), CRP (r = 0.2561), Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient (r = 0.4189), and lower PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio (r = −0.3636). RR was not correlated with any neurological symptoms. Dyspnoea was correlated with RR (r = 0.2932), A-a gradient (r = 0.1723), and lower PF ratio (r = −0.1914), but not correlated with PaO2 (r = −0.1095), PaCO2 (r = −0.0598) or any recorded neurological symptom except for altered consciousness. Impaired ventilatory homeostatic control of pH/PaCO2 [tachypnoea (RR>20), hypocapnia (PaCO2 <4.6 kPa), and alkalosis (pH>7.45)] was observed in 29%. This group, of which 37% reported no dyspnoea, had more severe respiratory disease (A-a gradient 38.9 vs. 12.4 mmHg; PF ratio 120 vs. 238), and higher prevalence of anosmia (21 vs. 15%), dysgeusia (25 vs. 12%), headache (33 vs. 23%) and nausea (33 vs. 14%) with similar rates of new anxiety/depression (26 vs. 23%), but lower incidence of past neurological or psychiatric diagnoses (5 vs. 21%) compared to appropriate responders. Only 5% had hypoxia sufficiently severe to drive breathing (i.e. PaO2 <6.6 kPa). At 6 weeks post-discharge, 24% (8/34) showed a new breathing pattern disorder with no other neurological findings, nor previous respiratory, neurological, or psychiatric disorder diagnoses. Conclusions Impaired homeostatic control of ventilation i.e., tachypnoea, despite hypocapnia to the point of alkalosis appears prevalent in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, a finding typically accompanying more severe disease. Tachypnoea prevalence was between 12 and 29%. Data suggest that excessive tachypnoea is driven by both peripheral and central mechanisms, but not hypoxia. Over a third of patients with impaired homeostatic ventilatory control did not experience dyspnoea despite tachypnoea. A subset of followed-up patients developed post-covid breathing pattern disorder.","","","","6b103783597c4f24e70dae6b48cdd661d6ed948c","","","","","","Inappropriate Ventilatory Homeostatic Responses in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b103783597c4f24e70dae6b48cdd661d6ed948c","","2022"

"1520",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is characterized by acute respiratory failure like ARDS with endothelial dysfunction and microand macrovascular involvement, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in about 5–23% of the cases [1–3] with high mortality [3, 4]. Most of hospitalized patients have hypoxemic respiratory failure, are old, or have comorbidities [3]. The capability of preventing serious illness with early interventions or managing severe disease could be essential to improve the patients’ outcomes. Better understanding of patients who will progress to acute respiratory insufficiency could help to better monitoring, correct time for possible medications, and choosing the best progressive respiratory support [5, 6]. Early detection of parameters that can predict poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients as old age, multiple comorbidities, high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and severe hypoxemia at admission [7] can help to improve intensive assistance and monitoring. COVID-19 patients that are hospitalized because of acute respiratory failure (20–40% patients) have viral pneumonia that can improve along time or evolve to ARDS, multiple organ failure, and death. These patients can also have complications as pulmonary embolism and secondary infections that must be diagnosed and treated [1, 2]. Monitoring of COVID-19 acute respiratory failure patients includes the following parameters: level of consciousness, capacity to protect the airways, respiratory drive and inspiratory muscles strength and endurance, respiratory rate, arterial gases with emphasis to PaO/ FIO2 ratio, PaCO2 and pH, and respiratory imaging in COVID-19; a thoracic angiotomography can evaluate the lungs parenchyma as well as the pulmonary vascular bed, and a dual-energy tomography can also evaluate the lungs perfusion [8]. Systemic parameters such as arterial pressure, cardiac function (especially cardiac ischemia and arrhythmias), renal function, and hydric balance can be important parameters in specific patients.","","","","e42f22084b9f697ca826dc87b8a489b9f73fd900","","","","","","Is It Possible to Predict Respiratory Evolution in COVID-19 Patients?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e42f22084b9f697ca826dc87b8a489b9f73fd900","","2022"

COVID-19 ARDS patients, within the first 48 h of the need for a non-invasive respiratory support, were retrospectively enrolled. Respiratory support was provided by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or by non-invasive ventilation. One hundred and four patients were enrolled, 84% treated with CPAP and 16% with non-invasive ventilation. Using the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach, 40% and 32% of patients presented respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respectively; 13% did not present acid-base disorders. Using Stewart’s approach, 43% and 33% had a respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respectively; 12% of patients had a mixed disorder characterized by normal pH with a lower SID. The severe hypoxemic and moderate hypoxemic group presented similar frequencies of respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. The most frequent acid-base disorders were respiratory and metabolic alkalosis using both the Henderson–Hasselbalch and Stewart’s approach. Stewart’s approach detected mixed disorders with a normal pH probably generated by the combined effect of strong ions and weak acids. The impairment of oxygenation did not affect acid-base disorders.","","","","f6d8f46cb401bae61435acb61d256bac22992b2f","","","","","","Acid-Base Disorders in COVID-19 Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6d8f46cb401bae61435acb61d256bac22992b2f","","2022"

Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 based on data of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction test from January to April 2020 in Gyeonggi-do, the largest province in Korea. Results Of the 502 patients, 298 consisting of 106 clusters with 5,909 contacts were included. Of these, 277 (93.0%) were symptomatic, and the most common symptoms were cough, fever, sputum, sore throat, and headache. A total of 94 patients (31.5%) had pneumonia, while 8 (2.7%) died during the follow-up period. The secondary attack rate (SAR) in the study population was 3.5% (204/5,909). In exposure settings, the SAR was higher in religious gathering (13.5% [95% confidence interval, 10.7–16.8%]), workplaces (8.49% [95% CI, 6.08–11.74%]), and schools (6.38% [95% CI, 3.39–11.69%]) than in health care facilities (1.92% [95% CI, 1.45–2.55%]). Sore throat at any period, dyspnea at diagnosis or any period, lower cycle threshold value in the lower respiratory tract samples, leukocytosis, and higher bilirubin levels were associated with higher infectivity of COVID-19. The presence of symptoms was not related to the infectivity. Conclusion In establishing the infection control strategies for COVID-19, the variables associated with high infectivity may be considered.","","","","b42d9a36d072b5592fd1eef19dc32f2792589123","","","","","","Infectivity of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Prospective Cohort Study in the Korean Metropolitan Area","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b42d9a36d072b5592fd1eef19dc32f2792589123","","2022"

In Kyoto city, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of HaH care focused on elderly COVID-19 patients from 4 February to 25 June 2021. Eligible patients were (1) COVID-19 patients aged ≥70 years and those who lived with them or (2) COVID-19 patients aged <70 years with special circumstances and those who lived with them. During the study period, 100 patients received HaH care. Their median age was 76 years (interquartile range 56–83), and 65% were over 70 years. Among 100 patients, 36 (36%) had hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤ 92%), 21 (21%) received steroid medication, and 34 (34%) received intravenous fluids. Although 22 patients were admitted to the hospital and 3 patients died there, no patients died during HaH care. HaH care may be safe and effective in elderly patients with COVID-19.

"1529",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","We have previously identified methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine dye approved for clinical use for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications, as a small-molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and ACE2, the first critical step of the attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that methylene blue concentration-dependently inhibits this PPI for the spike protein of the original strain as well as for those of variants of concerns such as the D614G mutant and delta (B.1.617.2) with IC50 in the low micromolar range (1-5 μM). Methylene blue also showed promiscuous activity and inhibited several other PPIs of viral proteins (e.g., HCoV-NL63 – ACE2, hepatitis C virus E – CD81) as well as others (e.g., IL-2 – IL-2Rα) with similar potency. This non-specificity notwithstanding, methylene blue inhibited the entry of pseudoviruses bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2-expressing host cells both for the original strain and the delta variant. It also blocked SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.5) virus replication in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.7 μM) when assayed using quantitative PCR of the viral RNA. Thus, while it seems to be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor with low micromolar activity and it has a relatively narrow therapeutic index, methylene blue inhibits entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, including several of its mutant variants, and has potential as a possible inexpensive, broad-spectrum, orally bioactive small-molecule antiviral for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","","","","dc7a9d376bfa68f697c368b8ba89ddc6ea8820ef","","","","","","Methylene Blue Is a Nonspecific Protein–Protein Interaction Inhibitor with Potential for Repurposing as an Antiviral for COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc7a9d376bfa68f697c368b8ba89ddc6ea8820ef","","2022"

One hypothesis to explain the apparent disconnect between severe hypoxemia and the reported absence of dyspnea is a blunted hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that patients with hypoxemia and COVID-19 have reduced ventilation compared with healthy control subjects. As part of a cross-sectional study of gas exchange in patients with early COVID-19 pneumonia on presentation to the hospital, we measured mean alveolar partial pressure of CO2 (PACO2), which represents the inverse of alveolar ventilation ( _ VA), and related it to the severity of hypoxemia as measured by PaO2. Published healthy subject data relating PACO2 to PaO2 under normoxic and acute hypoxic conditions (2–4) were used to assess whether _ VA levels of patients with COVID-19 were in the expected range for the severity of hypoxemia, thus inferring the ventilatory response of these patients.","","","","7b321f50d3e369ac57c8c8a6144f1b50d9309df1","","","","","","Ventilation Is Not Depressed in Patients with Hypoxemia and Acute COVID-19 Infection","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b321f50d3e369ac57c8c8a6144f1b50d9309df1","","2022"

The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies recommended “supportive care only” avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of “what was working and what wasn’t working”, the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and non-antiviral co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically.","","","","609e074dd9f8e1cf775c51964abbad19e3fcf86e","","","","","","“MATH+” Multi-Modal Hospital Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 Infection: Clinical and Scientific Rationale","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/609e074dd9f8e1cf775c51964abbad19e3fcf86e","","2022"

In this review, the hematological changes are evaluated, with particular focus on the morphology and metabolic aspects of erythrocytes. Changes in the functionality of such cells may, in fact, help provide important information about disease severity and progression. The viral infection causes significant damage to the blood cells that are altered in size, rigidity, and distribution width. Lower levels of hemoglobin and anemia have been reported in several studies, and an alteration in the concentration of antioxidant enzymes has been shown to promote a dangerous state of oxidative stress in red blood cells. Patients with severe COVID-19 showed an increase in hematological changes, indicating a progressive worsening as COVID-19 severity progressed. Therefore, monitored hematological alterations in patients with COVID-19 may play an important role in the management of the disease and prevent the risk of a severe course of the disease. Finally, monitored changes in erythrocytes and blood, in general, may be one of the causes of the condition known as Long COVID.","","","","632bd5c0a049d1c5153081711c5fa461d6b492cc","","","","","","Implication of COVID-19 on Erythrocytes Functionality: Red Blood Cell Biochemical Implications and Morpho-Functional Aspects","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/632bd5c0a049d1c5153081711c5fa461d6b492cc","","2022"

A pathological shift in the oxyhemoglobin curve (ODC) was previously described through the analysis of p50, intended as the oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is saturated by oxygen at 50%. The aim of this study was to analyze Hb-O2 affinity features over time in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients, through the analysis of ODC p50 behavior. A retrospective analysis was performed; through multiple arterial blood gas (ABG) analyses, each p50 was calculated and normalized according to PaCO2, pH and temperature; patients’ p50 evolution over time was reported, comparing the first 3 days (early p50s) with the last 3 days (late p50s) of ICU stay. A total of 3514 ABG analyses of 32 consecutive patients were analyzed. The majority of patients presented a left shift over time (p = 0.03). A difference between early p50s and late p50s was found (20.63 ± 2.1 vs. 18.68 ± 3.3 mmHg, p = 0.03); median p50 of deceased patients showed more right shifts than those of alive patients (24.1 vs. 18.45 mmHg, p = 0.01). One-way ANOVA revealed a p50 variance greater in the early p50s (σ2 = 8.6) than in the late p50s (σ2 = 3.84), associated with a reduction over time (p < 0.001). Comparing the Hb-O2 affinity in critically ill COVID-19 patients between ICU admission and ICU discharge, a temporal shift in the ODC was observed.","","","","0c4443b223e01efbe57a83baae56d0fdaa995259","","","","","","Temporal Changes in the Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve of Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c4443b223e01efbe57a83baae56d0fdaa995259","","2022"

Methods: We consecutively enrolled patients without clinical or biological evidence for superinfection, without left ventricular dysfunction and for whom a pulmonary embolism was discarded by computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography. We investigated lung ventilation and perfusion (LVP) by LVP scintigraphy, and, 24 h later, left and right ventricular function by Tc-99m-labeled albumin-gated blood-pool scintigraphy with late (60 mn) tomographic albumin images on the lungs to evaluate lung albumin retention that could indicate microvascular injuries with secondary edema. Results: We included 20 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All had CT evidence of organizing pneumonia and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. No patient demonstrated preserved ventilation with perfusion defect (mismatch), which may discard a distal lung thrombosis. Patterns of ventilation and perfusion were heterogeneous in seven patients (35%) with healthy lung segments presenting a relative paradoxical hypoperfusion and hypoventilation compared with segments with organizing pneumonia presenting a relative enhancement in perfusion and preserved ventilation. Lung albumin retention in area of organizing pneumonia was observed in 12 patients (60%), indicating microvascular injuries, increase in vessel permeability, and secondary edema. Conclusion: In hospitalized non-critically ill patients without evidence of superinfection, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac dysfunction, various types of damage may contribute to clinical deterioration including microvascular injuries and secondary edema, inconsistencies in lung segments vascularization suggesting a dysregulation of the balance in perfusion between segments affected by COVID-19 and others.

Objectives Our study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients undergoing early intubation compared to those undergoing late intubation. Methods This is a single-center retrospective study of adult COVID-19 patients admitted between March 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021. Early intubation was defined as intubation within 24 hours of a) hospital admission; b) respiratory status deterioration requiring FiO2 60% and higher; or c) moderate/severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis. Results Among the 128 COVID-19 patients included, 66.4% required early intubation, and 33.6% required late intubation. The 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration, hospital and ICU length of stay were equal regardless of intubation timing. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, COVID-19 therapies, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and pH were comparable for both groups. Better lung compliance was observed during early intubation than late intubation based on plateau (mean 21.3 vs. 25.5 cmH2O; P < 0.01) and peak pressure (mean 24.1 vs. 27.4 cmH2O; P = 0.04). Conclusions In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the timing of intubation was not significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes in the setting of matching clinical characteristics.

This retrospective study was aimed to assess the outcome of treatment with HFNC therapy in adult COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) admitted in intensive care units (ICU) and to assess the factors affecting outcome. Material and methods We retrieved electronic medical records of all COVID-19 patients who received HFNC for respiratory support after failure to maintain adequate oxygenation with conventional oxygen devices, between June 1 and August 31, 2020. The data retrieved were statistically analyzed. Results A total number of 558 COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICUs, out of which 139 patients were identified to be on HFNC and 85 met the inclusion criteria for the study. The success rate of 48.2% with HFNC was observed in these patients. The patients recorded to experience HFNC success were of young age and having higher baseline oxygen saturation compared to those who had its failure. The ROX indices post-initiation were observed to be significantly higher in the success group (p ≤0.001). Awake-prone positioning while receiving HFNC was followed by around more patients in the success group (p <0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline oxygen saturation, awake-prone positioning, and number of days on HFNC were found to be independently affected outcome with HFNC. Conclusion Almost half of the cases of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia can be managed successfully with HFNC, without the need of mechanical ventilation.

Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula>. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone’s camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue.

In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.","","","","7358ab8b5e4c58f5a73b4096914d94b407ed4c91","","","","","","A Multi-Channel Ratio-of-Ratios Method for Noncontact Hand Video Based SpO$_2$ Monitoring Using Smartphone Cameras","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7358ab8b5e4c58f5a73b4096914d94b407ed4c91","","2021"

The response to all these strategies, which include high nasal flow, continuous positive pressure, non-invasive ventilation, or even prone positioning in awake patients, can be highly variable depending on the predominant phenotypic involvement. Deciding when to replace conventional oxygen therapy with non-invasive respiratory support, which to choose, the role of combined methods, definitions, and attitudes toward treatment failure, and improved case improvement procedures are directly relevant clinical questions for the daily care of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

"1550",":Paper","CC-BY","Background Few studies have explored the illness perceptions, experiences or attitudes towards the future of survivors of critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Through in-depth qualitative interviews, we aimed to enrich our understanding of participants’ perspectives, with the hope of offering more holistic and appropriate care to future patients. Methods Participants who had survived critical COVID-19 illness (defined as a laboratory or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, with hypoxia requiring high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or mechanical ventilation) were invited to participate. After informed consent procedures, clinic-demographic details were documented and individual interviews conducted using a topic guide, and were audio-recorded, translated, transcribed and coded into NVivo software where themes were extracted. Results Of 21 participants (13 female, 8 male), the mean age was 51.8 years (range 34 - 68), and mean duration of COVID symptoms was 21.7 days (range 17 - 37). Eighteen participants had been on HFNO, and 5 required mechanical ventilation. The major themes were: distressing experience; faith-based beliefs sustaining them; gratitude to healthcare workers (HCWs); better understanding of COVID and how dangerous it is; optimism for the future; and a resolve to implement lifestyle changes. Conclusion Qualitative interviews revealed our participants’ experience of severe COVID-19 as a difficult and terrifying ordeal, mitigated by faith-based beliefs, and the presence and care of HCWs. These experiences were reported by the participants as life changing, and all were inspired to focus on future self-care, and invest in fulfilling relationships. These insights call for future interventions to improve patient-centred care, including follow-up debriefing sessions, and support for lifestyle changes.","","","","1d7d0e730fd00248d7e496e49c64370b87ec3aac","","","","","","New life after near death: Surviving critical COVID-19 infection","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d7d0e730fd00248d7e496e49c64370b87ec3aac","","2021"

However, the absence of respiratory symptoms may delay the start of NIRS. The aim of this study was to determine whether a simple bedside test such as single-breath counting test (SBCT) can predict the need for NIRS in the 24 h following the access to Emergency Department (ED). We performed a prospective observational study on 120 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. ROC curves were used to analyze factors which might predict NIRS requirement. We found that 36% of patients had normal respiratory rate and did not experience dyspnea at rest. 65% of study population required NIRS in the 24 h following the access to ED. NIRS-requiring group presented lower PaO2/FiO2 (235.09 vs. 299.02), SpO2/FiO2 ratio (357.83 vs. 431.07), PaCO2 (35.12 vs. 40.08), and SBCT (24.46 vs. 30.36) and showed higher incidence of dyspnea at rest (57.7% vs. 28.6%). Furthermore, SBCT predicted NIRS requirement even in the subgroup of patients without respiratory symptoms (AUC = 0.882, cut-off = 30). SBCT might be a valuable tool for bedside assessment of respiratory function in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and might be considered as an early clinical sign of impending respiratory deterioration.","","","","b305c60a11b32e39b785c8009b36194666ab5625","","","","","","Single-Breath Counting Test Predicts Non-Invasive Respiratory Support Requirements in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b305c60a11b32e39b785c8009b36194666ab5625","","2021"
"1553",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Background: Oxygen (O2) is a drug with specific biochemical and physiological properties, a range of effective doses and may have side effects. In 2015, 14% of over 55,000 hospital patients in the UK were using oxygen. 42% of patients received this supplemental oxygen without a valid prescription. Health care professionals are frequently uncertain about the relevance of hypoxemia and have low awareness about the risks of hyperoxemia. Numerous randomized controlled trials about targets of oxygen therapy have been published in recent years. A national guideline is urgently needed. Methods: A national S3 guideline was developed and published within the Program for National Disease Management Guidelines (AWMF) with participation of 10 medical associations. A literature search was performed until February 1, 2021, to answer 10 key questions. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) System (“The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence”) was used to classify types of studies in terms of validity. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for assessing the quality of evidence and for grading guideline recommendation, and a formal consensus-building process was performed. Results: The guideline includes 34 evidence-based recommendations about indications, prescription, monitoring and discontinuation of oxygen therapy in acute care. The main indication for O2 therapy is hypoxemia. In acute care both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia should be avoided. Hyperoxemia also seems to be associated with increased mortality, especially in patients with hypercapnia. The guideline provides recommended target oxygen saturation for acute medicine without differentiating between diagnoses. Target ranges for oxygen saturation are based depending on ventilation status risk for hypercapnia. The guideline provides an overview of available oxygen delivery systems and includes recommendations for their selection based on patient safety and comfort. Conclusion: This is the first national guideline on the use of oxygen in acute care. It addresses health care professionals using oxygen in acute out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings.","","","","f5e758ac18c7d8eb652181ffebb65bd630bc42e8","","","","","","German S3 Guideline: Oxygen Therapy in the Acute Care of Adult Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5e758ac18c7d8eb652181ffebb65bd630bc42e8","","2021"
"1554",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Abstract Introduction Prone positioning has been widely utilized in ARDS management before and during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its demonstrated mortality benefits. In pregnancy, proning requires careful attention to often overlooked physiologic changes in pregnancy and additional technical challenges accompanying a gravid abdomen. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a proning technique that was successfully used at our institution to avoid premature delivery of the fetus while improving maternal outcomes. All technical challenges are addressed in the instructional videos using a pregnant model with twin gestation at 32 weeks. Methods We reviewed all the patients’ charts with positive SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 until July 2020 and identified those who developed ARDS. Subsequently, we identified four patients that were proned during the antepartum period. We described their clinical course, including the change in ventilatory parameters in relationship with proning timing. Stepwise instructions for self-proning and proning in mechanically ventilated patients are illustrated in video format. Results During the study period, we identified 100 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanical ventilation was required in 8 of these patients. In four cases, proning was performed during the antepartum period. We were able to improve the P/F ratio while decreasing FiO2 and avoiding iatrogenic preterm delivery. Except for one case, where the patient self-extubated and required emergent delivery, all patients were successfully extubated, followed for prenatal care, and delivered for usual obstetric indications. Conclusion Proning remains a well-proven intervention in ARDS and should be considered in pregnant women when indicated. We recognize that proning might not be effective in all cases. However, proning positioning is an option to improve oxygenation in patients with severe hypoxemia when the next consideration is delivery of a premature infant or maternal cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","","","","5ec37e77235a0ab9de94b445efe3c15fa4f76359","","","","","","Proning modus operandi in pregnancies complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ec37e77235a0ab9de94b445efe3c15fa4f76359","","2021"
"1555",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Background Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy has been proposed to treat hypoxaemia and reduce inflammation in COVID-19. Our objective was to analyse safety and efficacy of HBO2 in treatment of hypoxaemia in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate time to hypoxaemia correction. Methods This was a multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between July and November 2020. Patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 ≤90% despite oxygen supplementation) were assigned to receive either HBO2 treatment or the standard treatment for respiratory symptoms for 7 days. HBO2 treatment was planned for ≥5 sessions (1 /day) for 90 min at 1.45 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Outcomes were time to normalise oxygen requirement to SpO2 ≥93%, need for mechanical respiratory assistance, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality within 30 days. A sample size of 80 patients was estimated, with a planned interim analysis after determining outcomes on 50% of patients. Results The trial was stopped after the interim analysis. 40 patients were randomised, 20 in each group, age was 55.2±9.2 years. At admission, frequent symptoms were dyspnoea, fever and odynophagia; SpO2 was 85.1%±4.3% for the whole group. Patients in the treatment group received an average of 6.2±1.2 HBO2 sessions. Time to correct hypoxaemia was shorter in treatment group versus control group; median 3 days (IQR 1.0–4.5) versus median 9 days (IQR 5.5–12.5), respectively (p<0.010). OR for recovery from hypoxaemia in the HBO2 group at day 3 compared with the control group was 23.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 329.6; p=0.001) Treatment had no statistically significant effect on acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days after admission. Conclusion Our findings support the safety and efficacy of HBO2 in the treatment of COVID-19 and severe hypoxaemia.

"1557",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Objective Between 1 March and 15 June, France experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 29 549 deaths occurred among COVID-19 patients, 17 250 of whom died in hospital. Our hypothesis is that crude mortality rates are not sufficient to assess the impact of the epidemic on public health. The objective of this paper is to estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) of patients who died from COVID-19. Method We realised a retrospective analysis of the exhaustive sample of COVID-19 PCR-positive patients who died in public hospitals of Marseille during this first wave. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities and care pathways were collected from medical records. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to assess what would have been the probability of dying within 1 year of these patients in the absence of COVID-19 and to estimate total YLL. Results Among the 1631 patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19, 178 patients died, at an average age of 80 years. According to CCI, 88.8% of the deceased patients had an 85% probability of dying within 1 year before COVID-19. Among the 11.2% who had a lower CCI probability, 18 out of 20 had at least one additional comorbidity known to be a major risk factor of mortality in COVID-19 disease. Cumulative total number of YLL was estimated to be 541 in this deceased population, that is, an average of 3 YLL. Conclusion Although our results should be interpreted with caution, this analysis confirms that mortality due to COVID-19 translates into a limited number of YLL due to both old age and preexisting comorbidities in the most vulnerable patients. This fact should be better considered in public health management of the pandemic both for risk communication and design of the most appropriate protective measures.","","","","c5f7045da57ceb7e8baa5f4e2f2bca7b94fb3bfb","","","","","","Life-years lost by COVID-19 patients in public hospitals of Marseille (APHM-South-Eastern France): a limited death toll: a retrospective analysis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5f7045da57ceb7e8baa5f4e2f2bca7b94fb3bfb","","2021"

"1560",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Chemosensory systems (olfaction, taste, trigeminus nerve, solitary chemoreceptor cells, neuroendocrine pulmonary cells, and carotid body, etc.) detect molecules outside or inside our body and may share common molecular markers. In addition to the impairment of taste and olfaction, the detection of the internal chemical environment may also be incapacitated by COVID-19. If this is the case, different consequences can be expected. (1) In some patients, hypoxia does not trigger distressing dyspnea (“silent” hypoxia): Long-term follow-up may determine whether silent hypoxia is related to malfunctioning of carotid body chemoreceptors. Moreover, taste/olfaction and oxygen chemoreceptors may be hit simultaneously: Testing olfaction, taste, and oxygen chemoreceptor functions in the early stages of COVID-19 allows one to unravel their connections and trace the recovery path. (2) Solitary chemosensory cells are also involved in the regulation of the innate mucosal immune response: If these cells are affected in some COVID-19 patients, the mucosal innate immune response would be dysregulated, opening one up to massive infection, thus explaining why COVID-19 has lethal consequences in some patients. Similar to taste and olfaction, oxygen chemosensory function can be easily tested with a non-invasive procedure in humans, while functional tests for solitary chemosensory or pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are not available, and autoptic investigation is required to ascertain their involvement.","","","","3877e8817c2666375b987d20fa619ef442faf986","","","","","","Are Multiple Chemosensory Systems Accountable for COVID-19 Outcome?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3877e8817c2666375b987d20fa619ef442faf986","","2021"

"1563",":Paper","CC-BY","Background: COVID-19 can infect an asymptomatic person silently without any overt symptoms despite diffuse blood clots throughout the body. Clot formation is induced by COVID-19 associated coagulopathy that can cause a high mortality rate. D-dimer, a fairly decisive marker for the coagulopathy event, is physiologically a marker of the fibrinolysis process. The increase of D-dimers in COVID-19 cases must be followed up because it relates to the initiation of a cytokine storm. Case presentation: We report an asymptomatic patient with sudden D-dimer elevation who received anticoagulant therapy. After three days of heparin administration, D-dimer results became normal and anticoagulant therapy was stopped. However, on the 12th day, the D-dimer level rebounded back and was followed by an increase of hs-C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, although SARS-CoV-2 PCR result became negative. A hyperglycaemic reaction and a sudden increase of HbA1C was observed in the patient. After three weeks D-dimer had returned to normal levels, and so did the other markers. The patient recovered fully and still no symptoms were obvious. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients without symptoms may be at risk of an asymptomatic coagulopathy process. The decreasing level of D-dimer erroneously cannot ensure that the coagulopathy process stops.","","","","f380f97308a71534a00e71e164a3cca9f2557013","","","","","","Case Report: Asymptomatic COVID-19 patient with a subtle hypercoagulable state and fluctuating D-dimer level","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f380f97308a71534a00e71e164a3cca9f2557013","","2021"

"1565",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Abundant evidence strongly suggests that the condition of pregnancy makes women and their fetuses highly vulnerable to severe Corona-virus 2019 (COVID-19) complications. Here, two novel hypoxia-related conditions are proposed to play a pivotal role in better understanding the relationship between COVID-19, pregnancy and poor health outcomes. The first condition, “misattributed dyspnea (shortness of breath)” refers to respiratory symptoms common to both advanced pregnancy and COVID-19, which are mistakenly perceived as related to the former rather than to the latter; as a result, pregnant women with this condition receive no medical attention until the disease is in an advanced stage. The second condition, “silent hypoxia”, refers to abnormally low blood oxygen saturation levels in COVID-19 patients, which occur in the absence of typical respiratory distress symptoms, such as dyspnea, thereby also leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. The delay in diagnosis and referral to treatment, due to either “misattributed dypsnea” or “silent hypoxia”, may lead to rapid deterioration and poor health outcome to both the mothers and their fetuses. This is particularly valid among women during advanced stages of pregnancy as the altered respiratory features make the consequences of the disease more challenging to cope with. Studies have demonstrated the importance of monitoring blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry as a reliable predictor of disease severity and outcome among COVID-19 patients. We propose the use of home pulse oximetry during pregnancy as a diagnostic measure that, together with proper medical guidance, may allow early diagnosis of hypoxia and better health outcomes.","","","","789f020d2cfcae56d60f22c7020dd80da7f59984","","","","","","The Misattributed and Silent Causes of Poor COVID-19 Outcomes Among Pregnant Women","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/789f020d2cfcae56d60f22c7020dd80da7f59984","","2021"
"1566",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Early in the pandemic era of COVID-19 the term “happy or silent hypoxia” was introduced to describe patients with COVID-19 who presented with severe hypoxemia and absence of dyspnea (Couzin-Frankel, 2020; Guan et al., 2020). The absence of dyspnea despite severe hypoxemia was considered to be a “paradox” and unique to COVID-19 (Archer et al., 2020; Ferenchick and Ferenchick, 2020). As such the term “happy or silent hypoxia” has been received wide attention by the press and social media and even described as a silent killer in COVID-19 (Levitan, 2020). Although scientific evidence is lacking, central nervous system viral invasion has been put forward to explain this “paradox” (Nouri-Vaskeh et al., 2020; Gopal et al., 2021; Tavčar et al., 2021). Nevertheless, basic principles of respiratory system physiology dictate that the absence of dyspnea despite severe hypoxemia is not specifically linked to COVID-19 but to other lung diseases as well (Tobin et al., 2020). The aim of our article is to present information about the responses to both acute and sustained hypoxia and provide an analysis of control of breathing physiology that could explain the absence of dyspnea despite severe hypoxemia. Specifically, we apply in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 our currently published analysis (Vaporidi et al., 2020) that relates arterial carbon dioxide levels with respiratory centers response to this stimulus, contrasting the brain’s responses to the patient’s ability to generate effective alveolar ventilation. This analysis may facilitate comprehension of the pathophysiology of dyspnea in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19.","","","","67e4f88b9c8ffb3276de4dd49bda32d027e4bec1","","","","","","Happy or Silent Hypoxia in COVID-19–A Misnomer Born in the Pandemic Era","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67e4f88b9c8ffb3276de4dd49bda32d027e4bec1","","2021"

Objective: Our meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical characteristics between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors requiring ECMO support. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed between December first, 2019, to June first, 2021. Studies with comparative data of COVID-19 ECMO patients were selected, in which clinical characteristics and complications were assessed. Results: Sixteen cohort studies involving 706 COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support with pooled mortality rate of 40% were included. Younger age (mean 51 years vs 55 years; P < .001), fewer comorbidities (23% vs 31%; odds ratio [OR] 0.55; P  =  .02), and less renal replacement therapy (RRT) (21% vs 39%; OR 0.41; P  =  .007) and vasopressor (76% vs 92%; OR 0.35; P  =  .008) requirement were demonstrated in COVID-19 survivors requiring ECMO support than nonsurvivors. Survivors also had higher pre-ECMO pH (mean 7.33 vs 7.26; P < .001) than nonsurvivors. No difference was observed in gender, body mass index, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) before ECMO support initiation, total ECMO support duration, and pre-ECMO parameters of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, tidal volume (mL/kg), positive end-expiratory pressure, and plateau pressure. The rate of bleeding complications was lower in survivors (32% vs 59%; OR 0.36; P  =  .001) than nonsurvivors, but no difference was observed in thromboembolism and secondary infections. Conclusions: We found advanced age, multiple comorbidities, lower pre-ECMO pH, greater RRT, and vasopressor requirements, and bleeding are predictors of death in COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support. The duration of MV before ECMO support initiation and total ECMO support duration was similar among survivors and nonsurvivors.

"1569",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Neonatal survival requires precise control of breathing and cardiovascular action, with fatal consequences or severe injury without support. Prematurity presents multiple opportunities to disrupt cardiorespiratory regulation, leading to expressions of apnea of prematurity, periodic breathing, and inappropriate cardiovascular responses to apnea. Failed breathing control can result from altered breathing drives, typically arising from untimely development of sensory or motor coordination processes. Some drives, such as temperature, are a special concern in neonates with low body mass, enhancing susceptibility to rapid body cooling. Chemical drives, such as pH or CO2 or O2, may be inadequately developed; in some conditions, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), breathing responses to CO2 or low O2 may be reduced or absent, and coupling of cardiovascular responses to breathing changes are abolished. Sleep states exert profound influences on both chemical and temperature drives, with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep potentially modifying descending temperature influences, and state transitions significantly altering respiratory responses to chemical stimuli. In addition, neonates spend the majority of time in REM sleep, a state which induces a generalized inhibition of skeletal muscle activity that abolishes muscle tone to upper airway and thoracic wall muscles, enhancing the likelihood for obstructive sleep apnea. Although disrupted regulatory drives can often be replaced by positive (or negative) pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure or enhanced by manipulating neurotransmitter action via caffeine, those approaches may exert negative consequences in the long term; the lungs of neonates, especially premature infants, are fragile, and easily injured by positive pressure. The consequences of caffeine use, acting directly on neural receptors, although seemingly innocuous in the near-term, may have long-term concerns and disrupts the integrity of sleep. The developmental breathing field needs improved means to support ventilation when one or more drives to respiration fail, and when the cardiovascular system, depending heavily on interactions with breathing, is compromised. Neuromodulatory procedures which manipulate the vestibular system to stabilize breathing or use tactile or proprioceptive stimuli to activate long-established reflexive mechanisms coupling limb movement with respiratory efforts can provide support for central and obstructive apnea, as well as for periodic breathing and cardiovascular action, particularly during sleep.","","","","6b1905728889c3dea6340adaad01a9aa48dcc718","","","","","","Neuromodulatory Support for Breathing and Cardiovascular Action During Development","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b1905728889c3dea6340adaad01a9aa48dcc718","","2021"

However, the stratification of patients at risk of mortality is not well defined. In this study, we aimed to define a mortality risk index to allocate patients to the appropriate intensity of care. Methods: This is a 12 months observational longitudinal study designed to develop and validate a pragmatic mortality risk score to stratify COVID-19 patients aged ≥18 years and admitted to hospital between March 2020 and March 2021. Main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: 244 patients were included in the study (mortality rate 29.9%). The Covid-19 Assessment for Survival at Admission (CASA) index included seven variables readily available at admission: respiratory rate, troponin, albumin, CKD-EPI, white blood cell count, D-dimer, Pa02/Fi02. The CASA index showed high discrimination for mortality with an AUC of 0.91 (sensitivity 98.6%; specificity 69%) and a better performance compared to SOFA (AUC = 0.76), age (AUC = 0.76) and 4C mortality (AUC = 0.82). The cut-off identified (11.994) for CASA index showed a negative predictive value of 99.16% and a positive predictive value of 57.58%. Conclusions: A quick and readily available index has been identified to help clinicians stratify COVID-19 patients according to the appropriate intensity of care and minimize hospital admission to patients at high risk of mortality.","","","","092302fb3de5f6bf062843386d4c13fff1764db7","","","","","","The COVID-19 Assessment for Survival at Admission (CASA) Index: A 12 Months Observational Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/092302fb3de5f6bf062843386d4c13fff1764db7","","2021"
"1571",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Background and Aim: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. By crossing boundaries between the disciplines of biophysics and pathophysiology, we present evidence that WCR may: (1) cause morphologic changes in erythrocytes including echinocyte and rouleaux formation that can contribute to hypercoagulation; (2) impair microcirculation and reduce erythrocyte and hemoglobin levels exacerbating hypoxia; (3) amplify immune system dysfunction, including immunosuppression, autoimmunity, and hyperinflammation; (4) increase cellular oxidative stress and the production of free radicals resulting in vascular injury and organ damage; (5) increase intracellular Ca2+ essential for viral entry, replication, and release, in addition to promoting pro-inflammatory pathways; and (6) worsen heart arrhythmias and cardiac disorders. Relevance for Patients: In short, WCR has become a ubiquitous environmental stressor that we propose may have contributed to adverse health outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and increased the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we recommend that all people, particularly those suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduce their exposure to WCR as much as reasonably achievable until further research better clarifies the systemic health effects associated with chronic WCR exposure.","","","","11ed28b5df0b780006a4da5039ddbb554b36119d","","","","","","Evidence for a connection between coronavirus disease-19 and exposure to radiofrequency radiation from wireless communications including 5G","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11ed28b5df0b780006a4da5039ddbb554b36119d","","2021"

As a step toward understanding these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19, recent experiments revealed contradictory data on the impact of COVID-19 infection on red blood cells (RBCs) oxygenation parameters. However, structural protein damage and membrane lipid remodeling in RBCs from COVID-19 patients that may impact RBC function have been reported. Moreover, COVID-19 infection could potentially disrupt one, if not all, of the other major pathways of homeostasis.

"1574",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","OBJECTIVES: Owing to the fact that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an underreported disease, the strategy used for the diagnosis of OSA has been extensively dissected to devise a simplified process that can be accessed by the public health services. Polysomnography (PSG) type I, the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA, is expensive and difficult to access by low-income populations. In this study, we aimed to verify the accuracy of the oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) in comparison to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) using a portable monitor. METHODS: We evaluated 94 type III PSG home test results of 65 elderly patients (69.21±6.94 years old), along with information, such as the body mass index (BMI) and sex, using data obtained from a clinical trial database. RESULTS: A significant linear positive correlation (r=0.93, p<0.05) was observed between ODI and AHI, without any interference from sex, BMI, and positional component. The sensitivity of ODI compared to that of AHI increased with an increase in the severity of OSA, while the specificity of ODI in comparison to that of AHI was high for all degrees of severity. The accuracy of ODI was 80.7% for distinguishing between patients with mild and moderate apnea and 84.4% for distinguishing between patients with moderate and severe apnea. CONCLUSION: The ODI values obtained in uncontrolled conditions exhibited high sensitivity for identifying severe apnea compared to the AHI values, and correctly identified the severity of OSA in more than 80% of the cases. Thus, oximetry is promising strategy for diagnosing OSA.","","","","c94ab1e58f54c6eb6bed305d04a7cec9ec9cfc00","","","","","","Diagnostic accuracy of oximetry for obstructive sleep apnea: a study on older adults in a home setting","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c94ab1e58f54c6eb6bed305d04a7cec9ec9cfc00","","2021"

It has increased hospital occupancy, heralded economic turmoil, and the rapid transmission and community spread have added to the burden of the virus. Most of the patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure often secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Based on the limited data available, there have been different opinions about the respiratory mechanics of the ARDS caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our article provides an insight into COVID-19 pathophysiology and how it differs from typical ARDS. Based on these differences, our article explains the different approach to ventilation in COVID-19 ARDS compared to typical ARDS. We critically analyze the role of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and proning in the ICU patients. Through the limited data and clinical experience are available, we believe that early proning in COVID-19 patients improves oxygenation and optimal PEEP should be titrated based on individual lung compliance.","","","","fdb810f670b9bc656a9877061d52cb9fccad05c0","","","","","","Role of proning and positive end-expiratory pressure in COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb810f670b9bc656a9877061d52cb9fccad05c0","","2021"

"1579",":Paper","CC-BY","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has presented emergency medical services (EMS) worldwide with the difficult task of identifying patients with COVID-19 and predicting the severity of their illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological respiratory parameters in pre-hospital patients with COVID-19 differed from those without COVID-19 and if they could be used to aid EMS personnel in the prediction of illness severity. Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 were included by EMS personnel in Uppsala, Sweden. A portable respiratory monitor based on pneumotachography was used to sample the included patient’s physiological respiratory parameters. A questionnaire with information about present symptoms and background data was completed. COVID-19 diagnoses and hospital admissions were gathered from the electronic medical record system. The physiological respiratory parameters of patients with and without COVID-19 were then analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression. Results Between May 2020 and January 2021, 95 patients were included, and their physiological respiratory parameters analyzed. Of these patients, 53 had COVID-19. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of having COVID-19 increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.000–1.118), tidal volume (95% CI 0.996–0.999) and negative inspiratory pressure (95% CI 1.017–1.152). Patients admitted to hospital had higher respiratory rates (p<0.001) and lower tidal volume (p = 0.010) compared to the patients who were not admitted. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of hospital admission increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.081–1.324), rapid shallow breathing index (95% CI 1.006–1.040) and dead space percentage of tidal volume (95% CI 1.027–1.159). Conclusion Patients taking smaller, faster breaths with less pressure had higher odds of having COVID-19 in this study. Smaller, faster breaths and higher dead space percentage also increased the odds of hospital admission. Physiological respiratory parameters could be a useful tool in detecting COVID-19 and predicting hospital admissions, although more research is needed.","","","","30bab5101601d8fd1037fa2728c1f17fa4969c2b","","","","","","Physiological respiratory parameters in pre-hospital patients with suspected COVID-19: A prospective cohort study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30bab5101601d8fd1037fa2728c1f17fa4969c2b","","2021"
"1580",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","TO THE EDITOR: We have read with great interest the paper authored by Barreto-Filho et al. (1), “Nondyspnogenic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 pneumonia.” Although the notion of blunted respiratory sensation in patients with COVID-19 has already been disputed (2), the authors developed in their viewpoint a physiological case to support the view that SARS-COV virus can decrease the capacity of infected patients to “feel” the effects of their viral pneumonia, leading to “nondyspnogenic hypoxemic respiratory failure.” Based on the evidence and the rationale presented in the paper, we fear that this article may contribute to more “myth-building” around this newly discovered disease. As briefly developed in our letter, the authors are excessively using the “argument from analogy” while making their case, without really bringing evidence of the existence of such a syndrome. They also seem to have disregarded the complex anatomical basis of dyspnea generation, which relies on widespread structures, making an isolated alteration of dyspnea—identical in many of these patients—difficult to conceive, not to mention the common observation of very severe asynchrony in patients with COVID when mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume strategies. Finally, no data obtained from a systematic study of breathing sensations in these patients, against adequate control groups, are presented. It is intriguing that the authors first acknowledged the fact that isolated acute hypoxemia at the level observed in these patients (who do receive oxygen supplement and typically remain with SaO2 > 88%) is unlikely to produce significant dyspnea, rendering obsolete the need to discuss the notion of “nondyspnogenesis,” as previously argued by Tobin et al. (2). Perhaps as importantly, unless a patient has underlying lung disease, COVID-19 viral infection does not cause hypercarbia or alteration in respiratory mechanics, during mild forms ofmultifocal pneumonia, that would be severe enough to produce major breathing sensation, at least at rest. Yet, the authors are trying to describe the possible physiological basis for a nondyspnogenic acute hypoxemic respiratory in COVD-19 pneumonia, an entity that they are not even sure is real. Equating the capacity of this virus to invade neurons, both experimentally and clinically, with an alteration in dyspnea sensation (1) is certainly a big leap in reasoning. Simply stated, the sensation of dyspnea can be understood as resulting from the collection of peripheral sensing inputs processed centrally in the brainstem, increasing in turn the neural output to the respiratory muscles while sending a “copy” of this information toward the thalamus, the limbic system, and the sensorimotor cortex, where the sensation becomes “conscious” (3–5). Therefore, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to imagine lesions of the central nervous system exclusively affecting breathing sensations to be systematically present in a large proportion of patients with COVID19 without alteration in any other sensory ormotor functions that are processed in the same areas. For instance, the authors reference literature on the role of the vagal and glossopharyngeal nerves in the ventilatory response and breathing discomfort during hypercapnia. True as this may be, it does not address the core argument of why and how COVID19 should be presenting with a reduced sensation of dyspnea. If cranial nerves were affected, we should expect patients to have deficits in the functions of these nerves that would manifest as changes in gastrointestinal motility, cardiac response, gag reflex, etc. Furthermore, if the virus was to affect deeper brain structures, such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or more extensively the dorsal or ventral medulla, which may indeed affect the responses to hypoxia and respiratory sensations, such lesions would not account for an isolated decrease in shortness of breath. Indeed, when limited and unilateral defects are affecting the rostral medulla, abnormal symptoms ranging from hypoventilation during sleep and reduced CO2 sensitivity to severe respiratory and cardiovascular control abnormalities are present (6, 7), whereas bilateral or more widespread lesions are usually lethal (8). These changes are not reliably observed in patients with COVID-19, who typically do not experience hypercapnia or certainly not severe respiratory and cardiovascular control abnormalities. The same reasoning can be applied to more rostral structure, including the thalamus, the limbic, or the sensory cortex (wherein painful sensations are also encoded) (9). We concede that the generation of dyspnea could be altered in patients with COVID-19 in coma with diffuse encephalitis; however, most patients who present with hypoxemic pneumonia have no neurological symptoms that would be compatible with the diagnosis of diffuse encephalitis. Finally, most clinicians caring for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 will have observed striking phenomena of asynchrony.

"1585",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Background: Hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 is one of the strongest predictors of mortality. Silent hypoxia is characterised by the presence of hypoxia without dyspnoea. Silent hypoxia has been shown to affect the outcome in previous studies. Methods: This was a retrospective study of a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hypoxic at presentation. Clinical, laboratory and treatment parameters in patients with silent hypoxia and dyspnoeic hypoxia were compared. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the factors predicting mortality. Results: Among 2080 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, 811 patients were hypoxic with SpO2 <94% at the time of presentation. Among them, 174 (21.45%) did not have dyspnoea since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, 5.2% of patients were completely asymptomatic for COVID-19 and were found to be hypoxic only on pulse oximetry. The case fatality rate in patients with silent hypoxia was 45.4% as compared to 40.03% in dyspnoeic hypoxic patients (P = 0.202). The odds ratio of death was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.41–2.97) in the patients with silent hypoxia after adjusting for baseline characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment and in-hospital complications, which did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.851). Conclusion: Silent hypoxia may be the only presenting feature of COVID-19. As the case fatality rate is comparable between silent and dyspnoeic hypoxia, it should be recognised early and treated as aggressively. Because home isolation is recommended in patients with COVID-19, it is essential to use pulse oximetry in the home setting to identify these patients.","","","","b5bbf164196f6c76c470567e0ca59c1943ae2ac7","","","","","","Silent Hypoxia in Coronavirus disease-2019: Is it more dangerous? -A retrospective cohort study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5bbf164196f6c76c470567e0ca59c1943ae2ac7","","2021"

From social distancing to oxygen stress, organisms have been tackling pandemic‐related problems for millions of years. What can we learn from such diverse adaptations in our own applications? This review uses a seminar course on the COVID‐19 crisis to illustrate bioinspiration as an approach to teaching biology content. At the start of the class, students mind‐mapped the entire problem; this range of subproblems was used to structure the biology content throughout the entire class. Students came to individual classes with a brainstormed list of biological systems that could serve as inspiration for a particular problem (e.g., absorptive leaves in response to the problem of toilet paper shortages). After exploration of relevant biology content, discussion returned to the focal problem. Students dug deeper into the literature in a group project on mask design and biological systems relevant to filtration and transparency. This class structure was an engaging way for students to learn principles from ecology, evolution, behavior, and physiology. Challenges with this course design revolved around the interdisciplinary and creative nature of the structure; for instance, the knowledge of the participants was often stretched by engineering details. While the present class was focused on the COVID‐19 crisis, a course structured through a bioinspired approach can be applied to other focal problems, or subject areas, giving instructors a powerful method to deliver interdisciplinary content in an integrated and inquiry‐driven way.","","","","e665481f7c409321a8bb5f11331cbf6c83fe5f61","","","","","","Bioinspiration as a method of problem‐based STEM education: A case study with a class structured around the COVID‐19 crisis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e665481f7c409321a8bb5f11331cbf6c83fe5f61","","2021"

Oxygen pinching reduced oxygen use by 51% to 64%, maintained simulated oxygen saturation between 88% and 90%, and increased simulated average alveolar partial pressure of oxygen from a room air baseline of approximately 131 to 294–424 mm Hg compared with 607 mm Hg with 10 liters per minute (LPM) continuous oxygen flow. Simulation provided a methodology to rapidly evaluate a technique that has begun to be used with COVID-19 patients in low-resource environments experiencing an acute oxygen shortage.","","","","d0301e81003f3be41323752042a196ed13cb00f0","","","","","","Manual Conservation of Supplemental Oxygen in Low-Resource Settings During the COVID-19 Pandemic","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0301e81003f3be41323752042a196ed13cb00f0","","2021"
"1591",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Background: Respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) often presents with worsening gas exchange over a period of days. Once patients require mechanical ventilation (MV), the temporal change in gas exchange and its relation to clinical outcome is poorly described. We investigated whether gas exchange over the first 5 days of MV is associated with mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days in COVID-19. Methods: In a cohort of 294 COVID-19 patients, we used data during the first 5 days of MV to calculate 4 daily respiratory scores: PaO2/FiO2 (P/F), oxygenation index (OI), ventilatory ratio (VR), and Murray lung injury score. The association between these scores at early (days 1-3) and late (days 4-5) time points with mortality was evaluated using logistic regression, adjusted for demographics. Correlation with ventilator-free days was assessed (Spearman rank-order coefficients). Results: Overall mortality was 47.6%. Nonsurvivors were older (P < .0001), more male (P = .029), with more preexisting cardiopulmonary disease compared to survivors. Mean PaO2 and PaCO2 were similar during this timeframe. However, by days 4 to 5 values for all airway pressures and FiO2 had diverged, trending lower in survivors and higher in nonsurvivors. The most substantial between-group difference was the temporal change in OI, improving 15% in survivors and worsening 11% in nonsurvivors (P < .05). The adjusted mortality OR was significant for age (1.819, P = .001), OI at days 4 to 5 (2.26, P = .002), and OI percent change (1.90, P = .02). The number of ventilator-free days correlated significantly with late VR (−0.166, P < .05), early and late OI (−0.216, P < .01; −0.278, P < .01, respectively) and early and late P/F (0.158, P < .05; 0.283, P < .01, respectively). Conclusion: Nonsurvivors of COVID-19 needed increasing intensity of MV to sustain gas exchange over the first 5 days, unlike survivors. Temporal change OI, reflecting both PaO2 and the intensity of MV, is a potential marker of outcome in respiratory failure due to COVID-19.","","","","8d7737b8e39a2ca8818c12f5e1813ad82d9af6d5","","","","","","Survival of COVID-19 Patients With Respiratory Failure is Related to Temporal Changes in Gas Exchange and Mechanical Ventilation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d7737b8e39a2ca8818c12f5e1813ad82d9af6d5","","2021"
"1592",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which binds to the S1 spike protein on the surface of the virus. To delineate the impact of S1 spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, we incubated the S1 spike protein with human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAEC). HPAEC treatment with the S1 spike protein caused disruption of endothelial barrier function, increased levels of numerous inflammatory molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-1β, CCL5, CXCL10), elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a mild rise in glycolytic reserve capacity. Because low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is associated with severe cases of COVID-19, we also evaluated treatment with hemoglobin (HbA) as a potential countermeasure in hypoxic and normal oxygen environments in analyses with the S1 spike protein. We found hypoxia downregulated the expression of the ACE2 receptor and increased the critical oxygen homeostatic signaling protein, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α); however, treatment of the cells with HbA yielded no apparent change in the levels of ACE2 or HIF-1α. Use of quantitative proteomics revealed that S1 spike protein-treated cells have few differentially regulated proteins in hypoxic conditions, consistent with the finding that ACE2 serves as the host viral receptor and is reduced in hypoxia. However, in normoxic conditions, we found perturbed abundance of proteins in signaling pathways related to lysosomes, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and pyrimidine metabolism. We conclude that the spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in HPAEC, and that treatment with HbA failed to reverse the vast majority of these spike protein-induced changes.","","","","a2530bf6d3eb7f205d54419ace6b8f1f78bed1d5","","","","","","Cell-Free Hemoglobin Does Not Attenuate the Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Subunit in Pulmonary Endothelial Cells","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2530bf6d3eb7f205d54419ace6b8f1f78bed1d5","","2021"

The objective of this paper was to analyze the prognostic ability of the pulse oximetry saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) and the ratio of SpO2/FiO2 to the respiratory rate–ROX index–as predictors of IMV in an emergency department in confirmed COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was carried out in four provinces of Spain between March and November 2020. The discriminative power of the predictive variable was assessed through a prediction model trained using a derivation sub-cohort and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) on the validation sub-cohort. A total of 2040 patients were included in the study. The IMV rate was 10.1%, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 35.3%. The performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was better than the ROX index–AUC = 0.801 (95% CI 0.746–0.855) and AUC = 0.725 (95% CI 0.652–0.798), respectively. In fact, a direct comparison between AUCs resulted in significant differences (p = 0.001). SpO2 to FiO2 ratio is a simple and promising non-invasive tool for predicting risk of IMV in patients infected with COVID-19, and it is realizable in emergency departments.","","","","809bf9cb6b4cb7e91f234643fcc99d22b6fd7fad","","","","","","Role of SpO2/FiO2 Ratio and ROX Index in Predicting Early Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19.

Owing to the necessity of following strict anti-epidemic sanitary measures when taking care of infected patients, the accessibility of standard diagnostic methods may be limited. Consequently, the significance and potential of bedside diagnostic modalities increase, including lung ultrasound (LUS). Method: Multicenter registry study involving adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, for whom LUS was performed. Results: A total of 228 patients (61% males) qualified for the study. The average age was 60 years (±14), 40% were older than 65 years of age. In 130 from 173 hospitalized patients, HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) was performed. In 80% of patients, LUS findings indicated interstitial pneumonia. In hospitalized patients multifocally located single B-lines, symmetrical B-lines, and areas of white lung were significantly more frequent as compared to ambulatory patients. LUS findings, both those indicating interstitial syndrome and consolidations, were positively correlated with HRCT images. As compared to HRCT, the sensitivity and specificity of LUS in detecting interstitial pneumonia were 97% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: As compared to HRCT, LUS is characterized by a very high sensitivity and specificity in detecting interstitial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Potentially, LUS can be a particularly useful diagnostic modality for COVID-19 patients pneumonia.","","","","e7ce29836452eda9c1d75ac173d1c3f17c69ca76","","","","","","Lung Ultrasound Examination in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Multicenter Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7ce29836452eda9c1d75ac173d1c3f17c69ca76","","2021"

"1606",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","The article written by Simonson et al. (2021), ‘Silent hypoxaemia in COVID-19 patients’, provides a comprehensive and interesting review on how hypoxaemia is related to dyspnoea.However, wewould like to address some points that need further clarification. Firstly, the terms ‘happy hypoxia’ and ‘silent hypoxia’ are based on the clinician’s perception of an expected response related to levels of oxygen saturation (SpO2 ; Tobin et al. 2020), which implies that the only symptom of hypoxaemia is dyspnoea. Dyspnoea, however, is complex and difficult to define, as it can be perceived in different ways – not only by ‘air hunger’ (Tobin, 1990). As dyspnoea is a subjective experience, it is difficult to match specific levels of arterial partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2 ) with this symptom. Indeed, a more appropriate term could be ‘asymptomatic hypoxia’, as we need to measure many variables including tissue hypoxia to be sure that it is ‘silent’. Humans have been dealing with hypoxia inmany different ways across our evolution, both as breath-hold divers (Schagatay, 2009) and as indigenous permanent inhabitants of moderate to high altitude regions of the Tibetan plateau, the Andes, Eastern Africa and North America (Huang, 2014; Simonson, 2015; West, 2019), proving that humans can thrive even in conditions of hypoxia. In addition, even in critical care patients, some levels of hypoxaemia could be accepted (permissive hypoxaemia) if tissue oxygenation is not affected (Martin & Grocott, 2013; Panwar et al. 2016). The individual response to hypoxia is highly variable; therefore it is difficult to define a precise threshold value of PaO2 and SpO2 (Tobin et al. 2020). Another important factor is timing, as the concept of acclimatization plays an important role in the response to hypoxia in order to cope with the restricted supply of oxygen (West, 2006). In COVID-19 patients, dyspnoea typically occurs 8–12 days after the onset of symptoms (Li&Ma, 2020; Zhou et al. 2020). Since it has been shown that acclimatization to high altitude takes between 4 and 8 days (Rahn & Otis, 1949), it may be possible that a similar process occurs in COVID-19 patients, having to cope with hypoxia for several days, hence reducing their oxygen consumption accordingly (West, 2006). Secondly, we would like to clarify some statements about breath-hold diving. In the review, the authors cite two references (Lindholm & Lundgren, 2006; Overgaard et al. 2006) to explain normal arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PaCO2 ) at the end of a breath-hold. Parenthetically, hyperventilation is avoided nowadays in competitive breath-hold diving, as it is a risk factor for hypoxic syncope (Pearn et al. 2015). Regardless, Overgaard et al. (2006) found end-tidal partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PET,CO2 ) at the end of breath-holding (at different lung volumes) ranging between 45.7 and 50.2 mmHg, which is not in the normal range. A classical study on exhaled gases (Liner & Linnarsson, 1994) found a baseline PET,CO2 of 39 mmHg, which, after a surface breath-hold, had gone up to 46mmHg, while it was 45mmHg after a simulated 20 m dive. Recently, PaCO2 was measured at 40 m depth, and it was found that baseline values of 37.7 mmHg had increased to 42mmHg at depth (Bosco et al. 2018), but these were not maximal-effort dives. Competitive breath-hold divers repeatedly expose themselves to hypercapnia and hypoxia, which increases tolerance to these stimuli due to a blunted ventilatory response to hypercapnia and/or hypoxia (Ferretti et al. 1991). During a breath-hold, PaO2 will continue to drop as long as apnoea is extended, while PaCO2 concomitantly rises, causing hypoxiaand hypercapnia-induced chemoreceptor activity in carotid and aortic bodies (Parkes, 2006). The resulting neural activity causes involuntary contractions of the diaphragm and inspiratory muscles, known as involuntary breathing movements (IBM; Hentsch & Ulmer, 1984). While untrained individuals may terminate apnoea shortly after the onset of IBM’s, competitive freedivers can consciously suppress this respiratory sensory information due to training-induced psychological tolerance until discomfort and/or signs of asphyxia (tunnel vision, hearing distortion) indicates them to break apnoea, before losing consciousness (Schagatay, 2009). Thus, in untrained individuals, the breaking point of apnoea will most likely be influenced by hypercapnia alone, while the combination of both hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hypercapnia, will be the determining factor for competitive freedivers. Freedivers also possess a powerful ""diving response"" which efficiently reduces metabolism and oxygen consumption (Schagatay, 2009). The responses to extreme hypoxia and hypercapnia are not only a feature of elite breath-hold divers, as studies show that this adaptation can be trained (Hentsch & Ulmer, 1984; Engan et al. 2013). Breath-holding therefore seems to be a good in vivo model to understand severe hypoxia, which may be useful to test hypotheses regarding the ventilatory drive on healthy individuals. Additionally, when hypoxia occurs, an early response is the rapid splenic contraction which elevates haematocrit. This response has been observed during breath-holding (Baković et al. 2003; Schagatay et al. 2005), at high altitude (Purdy et al. 2019; Schagatay et al. 2020) and under hypobaric hypoxia (Richardson et al. 2008; Lodin-Sundström & Schagatay, 2010). It allows an increase in oxygen blood content by 10%without any changes in SpO2 . So far, this response has not been studied in clinical situations related to hypoxia, but it was evident in drowning victims (Haffner et al. 1994) and could have importance in clinical conditions. Wewould like to remark on an observation of the authors in regard to the lack of an excessive ventilatory response that could reduce self-induced lung injury (Mascheroni et al. 1988; Brochard et al. 2017). We believe that a more holistic view that includes our natural defence mechanisms against hypoxia would be fruitful for better understanding of asymptomatic hypoxaemia. We advocate for this more holistic view as organism survival can be addressed in multiple ways.","","","","b5c381adcac704e245d03f39c463b80573b0089f","","","","","","A more holistic view could contribute to our understanding of ‘silent hypoxaemia’ in Covid‐19 patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5c381adcac704e245d03f39c463b80573b0089f","","2021"

"1616",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The key regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia and inflammation (hypoxia inducible factor, HIF, and nuclear factor-kappa B, NF-κB, respectively) are evolutionarily conserved and share significant crosstalk. Tissues often experience hypoxia and inflammation concurrently at the site of infection or injury due to fluid retention and immune cell recruitment that ultimately reduces the rate of oxygen delivery to tissues. Inflammation can induce activity of HIF-pathway genes, and hypoxia may modulate inflammatory signaling. While it is clear that these molecular pathways function in concert, the physiological consequences of hypoxia-induced inflammation and how hypoxia modulates inflammatory signaling and immune function are not well established. In this review, we summarize known mechanisms of HIF and NF-κB crosstalk and highlight the physiological consequences that can arise from maladaptive hypoxia-induced inflammation. Finally, we discuss what can be learned about adaptive regulation of inflammation under chronic hypoxia by examining adaptive and maladaptive inflammatory phenotypes observed in human populations at high altitude. We aim to provide insight into the time domains of hypoxia-induced inflammation and highlight the importance of hypoxia-induced inflammatory sensitization in immune function, pathologies, and environmental adaptation.","","","","cbedc6f24ac8fe2b5771798ed10da8331b334731","","","","","","Hypoxia and Inflammation: Insights From High-Altitude Physiology","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cbedc6f24ac8fe2b5771798ed10da8331b334731","","2021"

"1620",":Paper","CC-BY","Background & objectives: India witnessed a massive second surge of COVID-19 cases since March 2021 after a period of decline from September 2020. Data collected under the National Clinical Registry for COVID-19 (NCRC) were analysed to describe the differences in demographic and clinical features of COVID-19 patients recruited during these two successive waves. Methods: The NCRC, launched in September 2020, is an ongoing multicentre observational initiative, which provided the platform for the current investigation. Demographic, clinical, treatment and outcome data of hospitalized, confirmed COVID-19 patients were captured in an electronic data portal from 41 hospitals across India. Patients enrolled during September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 and February 1 to May 11, 2021 constituted participants of the two successive waves, respectively. Results: As on May 11, 2021, 18961 individuals were recruited in the registry, 12059 and 6903 reflecting in-patients from the first and second waves, respectively. Mean age of the patients was significantly lower in the second wave [48.7 (18.1) yr vs. 50.7 (18.0) yr, P<0.001] with higher proportion of patients in the younger age group intervals of <20, and 20-39 yr. Approximately 70 per cent of the admitted patients were ≥ 40 yr of age in both waves of the pandemic. The proportion of males were slightly lower in second wave as compared to the first [4400 (63.7%) vs. 7886 (65.4%), P=0.02]. Commonest presenting symptom was fever in both waves. In the second wave, a significantly higher proportion [2625 (48.6%) vs. 4420 (42.8%), P<0.003] complained of shortness of breath, developed ARDS [422(13%) vs. 880 (7.9%), P<0.001], required supplemental oxygen [1637 (50.3%) vs. 4771 (42.7%), P<0.001], and mechanical ventilation [260 (15.9%) vs. 530 (11.1%), P<0.001]. Mortality also significantly increased in the second wave [OR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52)] in all age groups except in <20 yr. Interpretation & conclusions: The second wave of COVID-19 in India was slightly different in presentation than the first wave, with a younger demography, lesser comorbidities, and presentation with breathlessness in greater frequency.","","","","f11efb4705a74bf07e37de57f63d5ea8f4df48ad","","","","","","Clinical profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in first & second wave of the pandemic: Insights from an Indian registry based observational study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f11efb4705a74bf07e37de57f63d5ea8f4df48ad","","2021"
"1621",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) (CARDS) pneumonitis presents a clinical challenge as regards to the timing of intubation and ambiguity of outcome. There is a lack of clear consensus on when to switch patients from trials of noninvasive therapies to invasive mechanical ventilation. We investigated the effect of the timing of intubation from the time of admission on the clinical outcome of CARDS. Aim and objective The aim and objective was to analyze the effect of timing of intubation early (within 48 hours of admission to critical care unit) versus delayed (after 48 hours of admission to critical care unit) on mortality in severe CARDS patients. Materials and methods A retrospective observational study performed in a 28-bedded COVID-19 intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India. All patients admitted between April 1, 2020, and October 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 (RT-PCR positive) requiring mechanical ventilation were included in the study. Results The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Among 2,230 patients that were admitted to the hospital, 525 required critical care (23.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 162 patients and 147 (28%) of critical care admission were included in the study cohort after exclusion. Seventy-five patients (51%) were intubated within 48 hours of critical care admission (early group) and 72 (48.9%) were intubated after 48 hours of critical care admission (delayed group). With regards to the total of 147 included patients; male patients were 74.1% with a median age of 59 years (interquartile range, 51–68 years). Diabetes (44.9%) and hypertension (43.5%) were the most common comorbidities. Higher admission acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores and lower absolute lymphocyte count were observed in patients intubated within 48 hours. The early intubated group had a mortality of 60% whereas the same was observed as 77.7% in delayed intubation group, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). Conclusion Current study concludes that early intubation is associated with improved survival rates in severe CARDS patients.

"1622",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","ABSTRACT Objectives We investigated how wearing a mask – and its modality (surgical vs. N95) – affect hemodynamic and hematologic function in males and females across two exercise intensities (submaximal (SUB) and maximal (MAX)). Methods 144 individuals participated in the present study and were randomly allocated to three mask groups of 48 (N95, SURGICAL, and NO MASK) with two exercise subgroups for each mask group (MAX, n = 24; SUB, n = 24) for both sexes. Participants in each experimental group (N95SUB, N95MAX; SURSUB, SURMAX; SUB, MAX) were assessed for their hemodynamic and hematologic function at baseline and during recovery after exercise. Results No significant differences were noted for either hemodynamic or hematologic function at post-exercise as compared to baseline with regard to mask modality (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) for maximal intensity were significantly greater at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to SURGICAL (P < 0.05). No differences were noted for hemodynamic and hematologic function with N95 and SURGICAL compared to NOMASK for either intensity (P > 0.05). Females showed significantly greater HR values at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to NO MASK, but no significant differences were noted for hematological function between sexes (P > 0.05). Conclusion Our findings show that wearing a face mask (N95/surgical) while exercising has no detrimental effects on hemodynamic/hematologic function in both males and females, and suggest that wearing a mask, particularly a surgical mask, while exercising during the ongoing pandemic is safe and poses no risk to individual’s health. Future studies examining physiological responses to chronic exercise with masks are warranted.","","","","3ec12cb7ba4225764ba0be900a9d4647b1cf9e06","","","","","","Does wearing a mask while exercising amid COVID-19 pandemic affect hemodynamic and hematologic function among healthy individuals?

Risk factors, histopathological characterization, pathophysiology, prevalence, and management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, and few studies have addressed these issues.Areas covered:This article reviews the current evidence regarding post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on the potential risk factors, histopathology, pathophysiology, functional and tomographic features, and potential therapeutic modalities. A search on the issue was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO databases and the Cochrane library between 1 December 2019, and 25 January 2021. Studies were reviewed and relevant topics were incorporated into this narrative review. Expert opinion: Pulmonary sequelae may occur secondary to COVID-19, which needs to be included as a potential etiology in the current differential diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, serial clinical, tomographic, and functional screening for pulmonary fibrosis is recommended after COVID-19, mainly in patients with pulmonary involvement in the acute phase of the disease. Further studies are necessary to determine the risk factors, markers, pathophysiology, and appropriate management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.","","","","646e6fa151c56e2454f89d1cdc766ba3b9ebe0bd","","","","","","Pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19: a narrative review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/646e6fa151c56e2454f89d1cdc766ba3b9ebe0bd","","2021"

"1628",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The immunological and pathophysiological response to COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory impairment affecting gas exchange and lung mechanics. Such was the scale of the respiratory support needed during the first wave of the pandemic, that recruitment of non-respiratory clinical staff was essential to help deal with the growing number of cases. It quickly became apparent that it was vital to rapidly equip these healthcare professionals with appropriate physiological knowledge and practical skills if therapies were to be applied effectively. Furthermore, the unravelling of unusual clinical features of COVID-19, further highlighted a need for knowledge of long-established principles of respiratory physiology. An online digital educational resource, or “respiratory learning tool kit” was developed with interactive material including visualisations, animations, and pathophysiological examples to facilitate understanding. The learning outcomes were centred on physiological principles, essential for understanding the pathophysiology relating to COVID-19, and management and treatment. Topics included principles of gas exchange, gas transport, homeostasis and central control of respiration. These basic physiological principles were linked to pathophysiology and clinical skills around oxygen administration and non-invasive supports such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). From the degree of engagement and evaluation comments, it was clear that the resource successfully achieved its aim—to increase physiological knowledge and its practical understanding, enabling healthcare professionals to practice with confidence in such an uncertain environment.","","","","0d20504b7e04cb876ea7f3a140b8813646ae5ffa","","","","","","Supplemental Learning in Respiratory Physiology for Healthcare Professionals Towards Successful Treatment of COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d20504b7e04cb876ea7f3a140b8813646ae5ffa","","2021"

To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the sorbed probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 (5108 KОЕ) and B. bifidum 1 (5107 KОЕ) in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-А3 in the complex therapy of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients without severe risk factors.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An open, randomized prospective study included 100 patients (45 men, 55 women), aged 18 to 60 years without risk factors for severe COVID-19 with pneumonia confirmed by computed tomography, and an area of lung lesion no more than 75% (moderate forms). SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs (RT-PCR) was detected in 72% of the participants, in the rest it was highly probable in terms of the aggregate parameters. Diagnostics of COVID-19 and its severity, the appointment of a standard examination and treatment were carried out in accordance with the Temporary Methodological Recommendations of the Ministry of Health of Russia, version 8 of 09.03.2020. This publication presents the results of using B. bifidum 1 (3 capsules twice a day for 10 days) during the peak of clinical manifestations (in a hospital).


RESULTS
In those who received sorbed B. bifidum 1, by the 10th day of treatment, the frequency of weakness was 32% lower (RR 0.55 [95% CI 0.240.73], OR 0.25 [0.110.59]); hypoosmia/dysgeusia by 22% (RR 0.42 [0.050.65], OR 0.40 [0.170.90]) and cough by 24% (RR 0.39 [0.070.60], OR 0.38 [0.170.84]). B. bifidum 1 reduced the average duration of weakness by 3 days [1.14.9], hypoosmia/dysgeusia by 3.2 days [1.35.1], cough by 1.9 days [0.43,4], dyspnea by 1.8 days [0.72.7], diarrhea by 1.7 days [0.13.5]; reduced the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 20% (RR 0.77 [0.240.93], OR 0.18 [0.050.68]). Due to the deterioration of the condition and the increase in the symptoms of respiratory failure, additional treatment was required less often by 24% (p=0.005). After the end of the intervention, the frequency of virologic debridement, levels of CRP, leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets and the degree of lung damage on computed tomography did not statistically differ in the compared groups. No side effects of B. bifidum 1 (5108 KОЕ) have been identified.


CONCLUSION
The use of sorbed B. bifidum 1 (5108 KОЕ) improved the well-being of patients without risk factors with moderate viral (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and reduced the duration of diarrheal syndrome in a short time. The safety profile of their use was high. More research is needed to clarify the anti-inflammatory effects of the sorbed probiotic.","","","","3ce77e96fd056cb7e835beee9c806d979bd73f6c","","","","","","[Efficiency of application of sorbed probiotics in complex therapy of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Among these sectors, healthcare providers and medical workers have been impacted prominently due to the massive increase in demand for medical services under unprecedented circumstances. Hence, any tool that can help the compliance with social guidelines for COVID-19 spread prevention will have a positive impact on managing and controlling the virus outbreak and reducing the excessive burden on the healthcare system. This perspective article disseminates the perspectives of the authors regarding the use of novel biosensors and intelligent algorithms embodied in wearable IoMT frameworks for tackling this issue. We discuss how with the use of smart IoMT wearables certain biomarkers can be tracked for detection of COVID-19 in exposed individuals. We enumerate several machine learning algorithms which can be used to process a wide range of collected biomarkers for detecting (a) multiple symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the dynamical likelihood of contracting the virus through interpersonal interaction. Eventually, we enunciate how a systematic use of smart wearable IoMT devices in various social sectors can intelligently help controlling the spread of COVID-19 in communities as they enter the reopening phase. We explain how this framework can benefit individuals and their medical correspondents by introducing Systems for Symptom Decoding (SSD), and how the use of this technology can be generalized on a societal level for the control of spread by introducing Systems for Spread Tracing (SST).","","","","a1d2b2e3b5fada7d618148fa8bb4c0daa2d59617","","","","","","Perspective: Wearable Internet of Medical Things for Remote Tracking of Symptoms, Prediction of Health Anomalies, Implementation of Preventative Measures, and Control of Virus Spread During the Era of COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1d2b2e3b5fada7d618148fa8bb4c0daa2d59617","","2021"

Intubation and mechanical ventilation are a strategic treatment of COVID-19 distress or hypoxia. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases through April 1, 2021, to identify relevant randomized control trials, observational studies, and case series. Results: 24 studies were included in this review. Studies were conducted in the USA, China, Spain, South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Brazil. Most patients were intubated in the intensive care unit. Rapid sequence induction was mostly used for intubation. ROX index might be utilized for the predictor of the necessity of intubation in COVID-19 patients. According to the previous studies the rate of intubation reported 5 to 88%. It was revealed that 1.4 - 44.5% of patients might be extubated. Yet obesity and age (elderly) are the only risk factors of delayed or difficult extubation. Discussion and conclusion: Acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients could require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, and hypoxia were the most important reasons for intubation. Also, increased levels of ferritin, d-dimer, and lipase in common with hypoxia are correlated with intubation and ICU admission Mortality following intubation is reported to be 15 to 36%. Awake-prone positioning in comparison to high-flow nasal oxygen therapy did not reduce the risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation. There was no association between intubation timing and mortality of infected patients. noninvasive ventilation may have survival benefits.

The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics—as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.","","","","349bc92c91ef2bfa22bfdd33f0665c709d31fc90","","","","","","Harnessing the Power of Smart and Connected Health to Tackle COVID-19: IoT, AI, Robotics, and Blockchain for a Better World","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/349bc92c91ef2bfa22bfdd33f0665c709d31fc90","","2021"

Interventions The studied oximeters are top-selling in Europe/USA (AFAC FS10D, AGPTEK FS10C, ANAPULSE ANP 100, Cocobear, Contec CMS50D1, HYLOGY MD-H37, Mommed YM101, PRCMISEMED F4PRO, PULOX PO-200 and Zacurate Pro Series 500 DL). Directly after collection of a SaO2 blood sample, we obtained pulse oximeter readings (SpO2). SpO2-readings were performed in rotating order, blinded for SaO2 and completed <10 min after blood sample collection. Outcome measures Bias (SpO2–SaO2) mean, root mean square difference (ARMS), mean absolute error (MAE) and accuracy in identifying hypoxaemia (SaO2 ≤90%). As a clinical index test, we included a hospital-grade SpO2-monitor (Philips). Results In 35 consecutive patients, we obtained 2258 SpO2-readings and 234 SaO2-samples. Mean bias ranged from −0.6 to −4.8. None of the pulse oximeters met ARMS ≤3%, the requirement set by International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)-standards and required for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 501(k)-clearance. The MAE ranged from 2.3 to 5.1, and five out of ten pulse oximeters met the requirement of ≤3%. For hypoxaemia, negative predictive values were 98%–99%.

"1641",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Összefoglaló. Számos közlemény született arról, hogy a COVID-19-pneumoniás betegek jelentős hányadában az artériás parciális oxigéntenzió kifejezetten alacsony, mégsem jellemző a dyspnoe, és a pulzusoximetria sem mutat - a csökkent oxigéntenzióval arányos - súlyos hypoxaemiát. A jelenséget ""happy hypoxaemia"" néven említik. Ugyanakkor a légszomjról nem panaszkodó, de súlyos alveolocapillaris O2-felvételi zavarban szenvedő COVID-19-pneumoniás betegek a legkisebb fizikai megterhelést sem tűrik, és állapotuk gyorsan kritikussá válhat, tehát a hypoxaemia mértékének időben való felismerése kulcskérdés. A jelen közleményben egy ilyen eset rövid ismertetése után összefoglaljuk a súlyos, de tünetmentes hypoxaemia hátterében meghúzódó élettani okokat. Ezek között szerepel a hypocapnia (respiratoricus alkalosis) is, mely alacsony oxigéntenzió mellett is a hemoglobin viszonylag megtartott oxigénszaturációját eredményezi. Ezért a mindennapi COVID-19-ellátásban a megismételt artériásvérgáz-meghatározások jelentősége nem hangsúlyozható eléggé. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 362-365. Summary. Many COVID-19 patients have very low arterial partial oxigen tension while severe dyspnoe does not develop. Pulse oxymetry indicates only moderate reduction of arterial O2 saturation in these patients. The phenomenon is named ""happy hypoxaemia"". Lack of (severe) dyspnoe and only moderately decreased O2 saturation in severely impaired alveolo-capillary O2 uptake may partially be explained by an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin in the presence of low arterial partial pressure of CO2. The latter results from increased alveolar ventilation, while low partial pressure of O2 in COVID-19 patients reflects right-to-left shunting of pulmonary blood flow and ventilation-perfusion mismatch of the diseased lungs. While such patients may have mild complaints as related to the real impairment of alveolo-capillary oxygen exchange, severe hypoxaemia is a negative prognostic factor of outcome in this state where severe clinical deterioration may rapidly appear. The latter circumstance together with the unusual relationship of O2 partial pressure and O2 saturation of hemoglobin in COVID-19 emphasize the importance of repeated complete arterial blood gas analyses in these patients.

"1645",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Objectives The majority of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 can be managed using virtual care. Dyspnoea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea measures in capturing hypoxaemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea in diagnosing hypoxaemia in COVID-19 patients. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from 3 April 2020 to 13 September 2020. Dyspnoea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/−LR) for detecting hypoxaemia. In the primary analysis, hypoxaemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%; the diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea was also assessed across a range of oxygen saturation cutoffs from 92% to 97%. Results During the study period, 89/501 (17.8%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 17/89 (19.1%) were diagnosed with hypoxaemia. The presence/absence of dyspnoea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxaemia, with SN 47% (95% CI 24% to 72%), SP 80% (95% CI 68% to 88%), NPV 86% (95% CI 75% to 93%), PPV 36% (95% CI 18% to 59%), +LR 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7) and −LR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.1). The SN of dyspnoea was 50% (95% CI 19% to 81%) when a cut-off of <92% was used to define hypoxaemia. A modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score >1 (SP 98%, 95% CI 88% to 100%), Roth maximal count <12 (SP 100%, 95% CI 75% to 100%) and Roth counting time <8 s (SP 93%, 95% CI 66% to 100%) had high SP that could be used to rule in hypoxaemia, but displayed low SN (≤50%). Conclusions Subjective dyspnoea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxaemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19. Safe home management of patients with COVID-19 should incorporate home oxygenation saturation monitoring.","","","","73ce677d77c16c9cadb250daa85539b29c2d9f6c","","","","","","Diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea in detecting hypoxaemia among outpatients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73ce677d77c16c9cadb250daa85539b29c2d9f6c","","2021"
"1646",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Background: The rapid increase in the spread of COVID-19 and the numbers of infected patients worldwide has highlighted the need for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and more advanced therapy. This need is more urgent in resource-constrained settings. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Study design: The current study was conducted based on a retrospective cohort design. Methods: The participants included 665 definite cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital from February 20 to May 14, 2020. The baseline characteristics of patients were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the significant odds ratio (OR) for ICU admission. Results: Participants were aged 59.52±16.72 years, and the majority (55.6%) of them were male. Compared to non-ICU patients (n=547), the ICU patients (n=118) were older, had more baseline comorbidities, and presented more often with dyspnea, convulsion, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and less often with myalgia. Significant OR (95% CI) of ICU admission was observed for the 60-80 age group (2.42, 95%CI: 1.01; 5.79), ≥80 age group (3.73, 95%CI: 1.44; 9.42), ≥3 comorbidities (2.07, 95%CI: 1.31; 3.80), loss of consciousness (6.70, 95%CI: 2.94, 15.24), tachypnea (1.79, 95%CI: 1.03, 3.11), and SpO2<90 (5.83, 95%CI: 2.74; 12.4). Abnormal laboratory results were more common among ICU-admitted patients; in this regard, leukocytosis (4.45, 95%CI: 1.49, 13.31), lymphopenia (2.39, 95%CI: 1.30; 4.39), elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (1.99, 95%CI: 1.04; 3.83), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.25, 95%CI: 1.18-4.30) had a significant OR of ICU admission. Chest computer tomography (CT) revealed that consolidation (1.82, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.24), pleural effusion (3.19, 95%CI: 1.71, 5.95), and crazy paving pattern (8.36, 95%CI: 1.92, 36.48) had a significant OR of ICU admission. Conclusion: As evidenced by the obtained results, the predictors of ICU admission were identified among epidemiological characteristics, presenting symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings.","","","","4a0b61ad1f8bae28f31f7b3947832e0ef432d6e0","","","","","","Predictors of Intensive Care Unit Admission among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in a Large University Hospital in Tehran, Iran","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a0b61ad1f8bae28f31f7b3947832e0ef432d6e0","","2021"

"1648",":Paper","CC-BY","INTRODUCTION
We sought to provide the first report of the use of NEWS2 monitoring to pre-emptively identify clinical deterioration within hospitalised COVID-19 patients.


METHODS
Consecutive adult admissions with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this single-centre retrospective UK cohort study. We analysed all electronic clinical observations recorded within 28 days of admission until discharge or occurrence of a serious event, defined as any of the following: initiation of respiratory support, admission to intensive care, initiation of end of life care, or in-hospital death.


RESULTS
133/296 (44.9%) patients experienced at least one serious event. NEWS2 ≥ 5 heralded the first occurrence of a serious event with sensitivity 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), specificity 0.28 (0.21-0.35), positive predictive value (PPV) 0.53 (0.47-0.59), and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.96 (0.90-1.00). The NPV (but not PPV) of NEWS2 monitoring exceeded that of other early warning scores including the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (0.59 [0.52-0.66], p<0.001) and quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (0.58 [0.51-0.65], p<0.001).


CONCLUSION
Our results support the use of NEWS2 monitoring as a sensitive method to identify deterioration of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, albeit at the expense of a relatively high false-trigger rate.","","","","9966694f20229313ae489498c30db8cb709baf98","","","","","","National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to identify inpatient COVID-19 deterioration: a retrospective analysis.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9966694f20229313ae489498c30db8cb709baf98","","2021"

"1650",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Abstract Background Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral disease that may cause interstitial pneumonia, impaired alveolar gas exchange and hypoxemia. We ascertained the time course of intradialytic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) in MHD patients between 4 weeks pre-diagnosis and the week post-diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods We conducted a quality improvement project in confirmed COVID-19 in-center MHD patients from 11 dialysis facilities. In patients with an arterio-venous access, SaO2 was measured 1×/min during dialysis using the Crit-Line monitor (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA, USA). We extracted demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data, and COVID-19-related symptoms from the patients’ electronic health records. Results Intradialytic SaO2 was available in 52 patients (29 males; mean ± standard deviation age 66.5 ± 15.7 years) contributing 338 HD treatments. Mean time between onset of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 and diagnosis was 1.1 days (median 0; range 0–9). Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis the rate of HD treatments with hypoxemia, defined as treatment-level average SaO2 <90%, increased from 2.8% (2–4 weeks pre-diagnosis) to 12.2% (1 week) and 20.7% (3 days pre-diagnosis). Intradialytic O2 supplementation increased sharply post-diagnosis. Eleven patients died from COVID-19 within 5 weeks. Compared with patients who recovered from COVID-19, demised patients showed a more pronounced decline in SaO2 prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions In HD patients, hypoxemia may precede the onset of clinical symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19. A steep decline of SaO2 is associated with poor patient outcomes. Measurements of SaO2 may aid the pre-symptomatic identification of patients with COVID-19.","","","","197641b3538a48aa509f9a69be97ed749e8a8657","","","","","","Arterial oxygen saturation and hypoxemia in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/197641b3538a48aa509f9a69be97ed749e8a8657","","2021"

"1653",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Alterations in brain functioning, especially in regions associated with cognition, can result from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and are predicted to result in various psychiatric diseases. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, diseases associated with sequelae of COVID-19, or ‘long COVID’, also include serious long-term mental and cognitive changes, including the condition recently termed ‘brain fog’. Hypoxia in the microenvironment of select brain areas may benefit the reproductive capacity of the virus. It is possible that in areas of cerebral hypoxia, neuronal cell energy metabolism may become compromised after integration of the viral genome, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Because of their need for constant high metabolism, cerebral tissues require an immediate and constant supply of oxygen. In hypoxic conditions, neurons with the highest oxygen demand become dysfunctional. The resulting cognitive impairment benefits viral spread, as infected individuals exhibit behaviors that reduce protection against infection. The effects of compromised mitochondrial function may also be an evolutionary advantage for SARS-CoV-2 in terms of host interaction. A high viral load in patients with COVID-19 that involves the CNS results in the compromise of neurons with high-level energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose that selective neuronal mitochondrial targeting in SARS-CoV-2 infection affects cognitive processes to induce ‘brain fog’ and results in behavioral changes that favor viral propagation. Cognitive changes associated with COVID-19 will have increasing significance for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and long-term care.","","","","4683088f9c8c016e2aecb9184156d3240c54c222","","","","","","Selective Neuronal Mitochondrial Targeting in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Affects Cognitive Processes to Induce ‘Brain Fog’ and Results in Behavioral Changes that Favor Viral Survival","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4683088f9c8c016e2aecb9184156d3240c54c222","","2021"

This phenomenon, referred to as silent hypoxemia, is not unknown in other settings, but was first described in the context of COVID-19 (1, 2) and occurred in our COVID-19 patient population with increased frequency. Some patients initially present with mild symptoms, but begin to show signs of decompensation after some hours. There is still a lack of systematic studies; the pathophysiology is only partly understood. Consequently, diagnostic interpretation and outpatient care are challenging; the absence of symptom-related distress increases the risk that severe courses of the disease are not recognized.

While enormous strides have been made in understanding the molecular pathways involved in patients infected with coronaviruses an overarching and comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is lacking. Such an understanding is essential in the formulation of effective prophylactic and treatment strategies. Based on clinical, proteomic, and genomic studies as well as autopsy data severe COVID-19 disease can be considered to be the connection of three basic pathologic processes, namely a pulmonary macrophage activation syndrome with uncontrolled inflammation, a complement-mediated endothelialitis together with a procoagulant state with a thrombotic microangiopathy. In addition, platelet activation with the release of serotonin and the activation and degranulation of mast cells contributes to the hyper-inflammatory state. Auto-antibodies have been demonstrated in a large number of hospitalized patients which adds to the end-organ damage and pro-thrombotic state.

We evaluated clinical outcome data of two hospitals that agreed on a predefined protocol for restrictive use of invasive ventilation where the decision to intubate was based on the clinical presentation and oxygen content rather than on the degree of hypoxaemia. Method Data analysis was carried out of patients with positive PCR-testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), typical history, and symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates who exhibited oxygen saturation values of <93%. Results We identified 78 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The oxygen saturation nadir was 84.4±6.5% for the whole group. 53 patients (68%) received nasal oxygen (group 1), 17 patients (22%) were treated with nasal high-flow continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation or a combination thereof (group 2), and eight patients (10%) were intubated (group 3). The Horovitz index was 216±8 for group 1, 157±13 for group 2 and 106±15 for group 3. Oxygen content was 14.5±2.5, 13.4±1.9 and 11.6±2.6 mL O2·dL−1 for the three respective groups.

A growing number of studies have found that the severe COVID-19 patients have thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolism. Coagulopathy associated with increased risk of death in the patients. Unfortunately, the mechanism of coagulopathy is not clearly addressed. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 thrombosis and improving the coagulopathy through efficient treatment may help to stop disease progression, reduce mortality and sequelae. In severe COVID-19 patients, inflammation, cytokine storm, and coagulation are closely related, which together cause blood congestion and thrombosis. Many cytokines activate blood cells, expressing activating factors or releasing activated microparticles, and then accelerating thrombosis. However, the role of blood cells is not well understood in COVID-19 patients. In addition, cytokines stimulate endothelial cells, transforming them into a procoagulant phenotype.

"1663",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a major worldwide public health issue. Initially, improved supportive and anti-inflammatory intervention, often employing known drugs or technologies, provided measurable improvement in management. We have recently seen advances in specific therapeutic interventions and in vaccines. Nevertheless, it will be months before most of the world's population can be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. In the interim, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment offers several potentially beneficial therapeutic effects. Three small published series, one with a propensity-score-matched control group, have demonstrated safety and initial efficacy. Additional anecdotal reports are consistent with these publications. HBO2 delivers oxygen in extreme conditions of hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia, even in the presence of lung pathology. It provides anti-inflammatory and anti-proinflammatory effects likely to ameliorate the overexuberant immune response common to COVID-19. Unlike steroids, it exerts these effects without immune suppression. One study suggests HBO2 may reduce the hypercoagulability seen in COVID patients. Also, hyperbaric oxygen offers a likely successful intervention to address the oxygen debt expected to arise from a prolonged period of hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. To date, 11 studies designed to investigate the impact of HBO2 on patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 have been posted on clinicaltrials.gov. This paper describes the promising physiologic and biochemical effects of hyperbaric oxygen in COVID-19 and potentially in other disorders with similar pathologic mechanisms.","","","","be581397e878f59b8a78139d1ebeee436e7abd40","","","","","","Physiologic and biochemical rationale for treating COVID-19 patients with hyperbaric oxygen.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be581397e878f59b8a78139d1ebeee436e7abd40","","2021"
"1664",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The growing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis has stressed worldwide healthcare systems probably as never before, requiring a tremendous increase of the capacity of intensive care units to handle the sharp rise of patients in critical situation. Since the dominant respiratory feature of COVID-19 is worsening arterial hypoxemia, eventually leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) promptly needing mechanical ventilation, a systematic recourse to intubation of every hypoxemic patient may be difficult to sustain in such peculiar context and may not be deemed appropriate for all patients. Then, it is essential that caregivers have a solid knowledge of physiological principles to properly interpret arterial oxygenation, to intubate at the satisfactory moment, to adequately manage mechanical ventilation, and, finally, to initiate ventilator weaning, as safely and as expeditiously as possible, in order to make it available for the next patient. Through the expected mechanisms of COVID-19-induced hypoxemia, as well as the notion of silent hypoxemia often evoked in COVID-19 lung injury and its potential parallelism with high altitude pulmonary edema, from the description of hemoglobin oxygen affinity in patients with severe COVID-19 to the interest of the prone positioning in order to treat severe ARDS patients, this review aims to help caregivers from any specialty to handle respiratory support following recent knowledge in the pathophysiology of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection.","","","","f0a7ea0910a8b79e809ce7f5da512e4664954fc5","","","","","","The Fundamentals of Respiratory Physiology to Manage the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Overview","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a7ea0910a8b79e809ce7f5da512e4664954fc5","","2021"

We aim to describe the acute functional outcomes of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients after transferring out of the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: 51 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients at a national designated center for COVID-19 were included in this exploratory, retrospective observational cohort study from January 1 to May 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed. Functional outcomes were measured primarily with the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and divided into 2 categories: dependent ambulators (FAC 0–3) and independent ambulators (FAC 4–5). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine associations. Results: Many patients were dependent ambulators (47.1%) upon transferring out of ICU, although 92.2% regained independent ambulation at discharge. On multivariate analysis, we found that a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1 or more (odds ratio 14.02, 95% CI 1.15–171.28, P = 0.039) and a longer length of ICU stay (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.04–2.16, P = 0.029) were associated with dependent ambulation upon discharge from ICU. Conclusions: Critically ill COVID-19 survivors have a high level of impairment following discharge from ICU. Such patients should be screened for impairment and managed appropriately by rehabilitation professionals, so as to achieve good functional outcomes on discharge.","","","","8596d566b2075d7fb6e1a27547a1895bd1d621b0","","","","","","Acute Functional Outcomes in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8596d566b2075d7fb6e1a27547a1895bd1d621b0","","2021"
"1666",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 μM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction. Methylene blue inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells with similar IC50 (3.5 μM). Hence, this PPI inhibitory activity could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","","","","fe63a6ae45ebba918bd843898917fa9f7bb07f9d","","","","","","Methylene Blue Inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 Spike–ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction–a Mechanism that can Contribute to its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe63a6ae45ebba918bd843898917fa9f7bb07f9d","","2021"

Recognizing hypoxia in patients early on can have a considerable effect on therapy success and survival rate. Methods We collected data using a standard blood gas analyzer from 50 patients and analyzed measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxide-pCO2, partial pressure of oxygen-pO2 and oxygen saturation-sO2, bicarbonate concentrations-HCO3− as well as ionized calcium concentrations. We further examined PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 of the patients and analyzed differences between patients tested positive and those tested negative for the virus. Results Venous pCO2 was significantly higher whereas pO2 and sO2 were significantly lower in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The pH, and ionized calcium concentrations of patients tested positive for the virus were significantly lower than in those tested negative. Conclusions Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients upon admission to the emergency room exhibit lower venous blood levels of oxygen, pH, and calcium and higher levels of carbon dioxide compared to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. This blood gas analysis constellation could help in identifying SARS-CoV-2-positive patients more rapidly and identifying early signs of hypoxia.","","","","756e1bc5da7b6bfc44de1a5d1a58ce6e993d7795","","","","","","Venous blood gas analysis in patients with COVID-19 symptoms in the early assessment of virus positivity","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/756e1bc5da7b6bfc44de1a5d1a58ce6e993d7795","","2020"
"1668",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with pneumonia in China (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) at the end of 2019, the world is currently facing a global pandemic of infections with SARS-CoV-2 and cases of COVID-19. Since severely ill patients often show elevated methemoglobin (MetHb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentrations in their blood as a marker of disease severity, we aimed to summarize the currently available published study results (case reports and cross-sectional studies) on MetHb and COHb concentrations in the blood of COVID-19 patients. To this end, a systematic literature research was performed. For the case of MetHb, seven publications were identified (five case reports and two cross-sectional studies), and for the case of COHb, three studies were found (two cross-sectional studies and one case report). The findings reported in the publications show that an increase in MetHb and COHb can happen in COVID-19 patients, especially in critically ill ones, and that MetHb and COHb can increase to dangerously high levels during the course of the disease in some patients. The medications given to the patient and the patient’s glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status seem to be important factors determining the severity of the methemoglobinemia and carboxyhemoglobinemia. Therefore, G6PD status should be determined before medications such as hydroxychloroquine are administered. In conclusion, MetHb and COHb can be elevated in COVID-19 patients and should be checked routinely in order to provide adequate medical treatment as well as to avoid misinterpretation of fingertip pulse oximetry readings, which can be inaccurate and unreliable in case of elevated MetHb and COHb levels in the blood.","","","","de5572c78cee1a655ce5d2e0b9adf50d955e67d4","","","","","","The Role of Methemoglobin and Carboxyhemoglobin in COVID-19: A Review","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de5572c78cee1a655ce5d2e0b9adf50d955e67d4","","2020"
"1669",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Anti‐tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologicals, Dexamethasone and rIL‐7 are of considerable interest in treating COVID‐19 patients who are in danger of, or have become, seriously ill. Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well‐conducted human trials. Newer information with anti‐TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID‐19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti‐TNF biologicals on community‐acquired COVID‐19 during their long‐term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL‐7Rα, the receptor for IL‐7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody‐based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL‐7‐ enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti‐TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL‐7, currently being trialed as a COVID‐19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID‐19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4‐positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins.","","","","553e6fa5f4a7adaa15a5049cdc2bbf98483685fa","","","","","","Background to new treatments for COVID‐19, including its chronicity, through altering elements of the cytokine storm","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553e6fa5f4a7adaa15a5049cdc2bbf98483685fa","","2020"

Thanks to early flattening of the epidemiological curve, ventilator demand in Greece was kept lower than supply throughout the pandemic, allowing for unbiased comparison of the outcomes of patients undergoing early intubation vs. delayed or no intubation. Methods: We conducted an observational study including all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 consecutively admitted in Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020. Patients subsequently admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into the “early intubation” vs. the “delayed or no intubation” group. The “delayed or no intubation” group included patients receiving non-rebreather mask for equal to or more than 24 h or high-flow nasal oxygen for any period of time or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for any period of time in an attempt to avoid intubation. The remaining intubated patients comprised the “early intubation” group. Results: During the study period, a total of 101 patients (37% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the hospital. Fifty-nine patients (58% of the entire cohort) were exclusively hospitalized in general wards with a mortality of 3% and median length of stay of 7 days. Forty-two patients (19% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the ICU; all with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Of those admitted in the ICU, 62% had at least one comorbidity and 14% were never intubated. Early intubation was not associated with higher ICU-mortality (21 vs. 33%), fewer ventilator-free days (3 vs. 2 days) or fewer ICU-free days than delayed or no intubation. Conclusions: A strategy of early intubation was not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to delayed or no intubation. Given that early intubation may presumably reduce virus aerosolization, these results may justify further research with a randomized controlled trial.","","","","5741891d83bedd3f811c3940e7617fe22627dc13","","","","","","Effect of Early vs. Delayed or No Intubation on Clinical Outcomes of Patients With COVID-19: An Observational Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5741891d83bedd3f811c3940e7617fe22627dc13","","2020"

"1672",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Shortly after the onset of the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), concerns were raised about the potentially heightened risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).1 To substantiate these suspicions, we performed a questionnaire-based study to assess the severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering PD andmultiple sclerosis (MS), whose SARSCoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. We found that none of them (PD, n= 5;MS, n= 10) developed severe clinical manifestations of infectious disease. Importantly, all patients were taking amantadine.2 Although the aforementioned lack of severe cases among patients taking amantadine could happen by chance, it also provoked hypothesis generation. We suggested that our finding may reflect possible effect of amantadine antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2. Indeed, it has recently been shown that amantadine interferes with the lysosomal milieu andmay inhibit the virus’s entry to host cells.3 However, currently amantadine is the foremost neurological drug, used to treat PD and disorders of consciousness and prescribed off-label to patients suffering from MS. The drug enters the blood-brain barrier and acts as a weak but unique glutamate/N-methyl-Daspartate receptor antagonist, which concomitantly activates the cystine/glutamate antiporter and stimulates glutathione synthesis.4 We would like to point to 2 other possible mechanisms by which this drug could contribute to mitigation of COVID-19 in infected patients. The first relates to the anti-fatigue effect. Fatigue, a very prevalent symptom in MS (>90% patients), is a multifaceted phenomenon partially related to central mechanisms. Already >3 decades ago a serendipitous observation was made that a patient with MS had a remarkable improvement in fatigue while taking amantadine to prevent influenza, and the effect was soon confirmed in a small double-blind controlled study. Amantadine is the only drug that seemed to improve fatigue symptoms in MS, although the data were limited,5 and a more recent study did not support such conclusion.6 Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19 in adults and is more common in patients who require hospitalization. A recent report evidenced that COVID-19 increased fatigue in a cohort of patients with PD.7 Importantly, patients with MS and PD display blunted respiratory response to hypercapina and hypoxia.8,9 A connection of depressed responsivity to carbon dioxide and hypoxia with fatigue appears intuitively highly probable. The second mechanism by which amantadine may benefit patients with COVID-19 relates to its arousalenhancing effect. Impaired consciousness is a frequent central nervous system manifestation of COVID-19. Since arousal is a normal, physiological response to respiratory stimuli such as hypoxia and hypercapnia, it is plausible to expect that impaired consciousness in patients with COVID-19 blunt their respiratory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Depressed response to hypercapnia and hypoxia may be an important factor in the development of severe forms of COVID-19, including the so-called silent, or “happy” hypoxemia, a phenomenon of the absence of dyspnea in patients with COVID-19 who exhibit severe hypoxemia with considerable risk of death.10 Although it is too early to advocate amantadine as a treatment for COVID-19, a controlled trial of this drug for postexposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV2 infection is indicated.","","","","0e9a379b55bfb2d29c354c423780e4050b8a16f0","","","","","","Amantadine for COVID‐19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e9a379b55bfb2d29c354c423780e4050b8a16f0","","2020"

The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies’ recommended “supportive care only” avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of “what was working and what wasn’t working,” the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically.

Our aim was to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. Methodology/Principal findings The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patients condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW environment that is able to provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO 2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO 2 <92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidences that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.","","","","a9fb1f2279bfd3460b673e546f9a9b1aacd2f421","","","","","","An emergency system for monitoring pulse oximetry, peak expiratory flow, and body temperature of patients with COVID-19 at home: Development and preliminary application","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9fb1f2279bfd3460b673e546f9a9b1aacd2f421","","2020"

We aimed to identify differences in patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of COVID-19 positive cases to develop and validate a diagnostic-model predicting who will develop severe-form and who will need critical-care in the future. Methods: In this observational retrospective study, COVID-19 positive cases (total 417) diagnosed in Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE were recruited, and their prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital and the need for intensive care was reviewed until their tests turned negative. Patients were classified according to their clinical state into mild, moderate, severe, and critical. We retrieved all the baseline clinical data, laboratory, and radiological results and used them to identify parameters that can predict admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Patients with ICU admission showed a distinct clinical, demographic as well as laboratory features when compared to patients who did not need ICU admission. This includes the elder age group, male gender, and presence of comorbidities like diabetes and history of hypertension. ROC and Precision-Recall curves showed that among all variables, D dimers (>1.5 mg/dl), Urea (>6.5 mmol/L), and Troponin (>13.5 ng/ml) could positively predict the admission to ICU in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, decreased Lymphocyte count and albumin can predict admission to ICU in patients with COVID-19 with acceptable sensitivity (59.32, 95% CI [49.89–68.27]) and specificity (79.31, 95% CI [72.53–85.07]).

"1679",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","SUMMARY The world is struggling to deal with the corona pandemic. Effective therapies are still awaited due to the lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Bearing recent research and clinical observations in mind, the authors propose a novel physiological mechanism of COVID-19 and explain development of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 related hemoglobinopathy. It is a consistent observation that the radiological picture of COVID-19 related ARDS bears more resemblance to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) than typical ARDS. There has been great controversy regarding this proposed similarity. The main argument from those objecting to this comparison is that the etiology is hypoxia in case of HAPE and inflammation in COVID-19 related ARDS. We propose that considering the recent bioinformatics prediction models, COVID-19 might first infect red blood cells via CD147 and cause hemoglobin damage. The resulting hypoxemia may cause pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction leading to HAPE-like lung lesions. The now introduced alveolar hypoxia further exaggerates hemoglobinopathy hypoxemia leading to a vicious cycle. In this review, the authors recommend laboratory experiments to prove these hypotheses. The proposed physiological mechanism has significant therapeutic implications. If proven, the authors suggest the use of exchange transfusion as adjunct therapy and development of anti-CD147 drugs.","","","","dcc3c6e3bce36ea62a3fb7e899c34c8fc3796de5","","","","","","COULD COVID-19 BE A HEMOGLOBINOPATHY?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcc3c6e3bce36ea62a3fb7e899c34c8fc3796de5","","2020"
"1680",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Introduction UK guidelines suggest that pulse oximetry, rather than blood gas sampling, is adequate for monitoring of patients with COVID-19 if CO2 retention is not suspected. However, pulse oximetry has impaired accuracy in certain patient groups, and data are lacking on its accuracy in patients with COVID-19 stepping down from intensive care unit (ICU) to non-ICU settings or being transferred to another ICU. Methods We assessed the bias, precision and limits of agreement using 90 paired SpO2 and SaO2 from 30 patients (3 paired samples per patient). To assess the agreement between pulse oximetry (SpO2) and arterial blood gas analysis (SaO2) in patients with COVID-19, deemed clinically stable to step down from an ICU to a non-ICU ward, or be transferred to another ICU. This was done to evaluate whether the guidelines were appropriate for our setting. Results Mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 (bias) was 0.4%, with an SD of 2.4 (precision). The limits of agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 were as follows: upper limit of 5.2% (95% CI 6.5% to 4.2%) and lower limit of −4.3% (95% CI −3.4% to −5.7%). Conclusions In our setting, pulse oximetry showed a level of agreement with SaO2 measurement that was slightly suboptimal, although within acceptable levels for Food and Drug Authority approval, in people with COVID-19 judged clinically ready to step down from ICU to a non-ICU ward, or who were being transferred to another hospital’s ICU. In such patients, SpO2 should be interpreted with caution. Arterial blood gas assessment of SaO2 may still be clinically indicated.","","","","b964e19d2a40e57e0238fe027b268a0c9d20adc4","","","","","","Working accuracy of pulse oximetry in COVID-19 patients stepping down from intensive care: a clinical evaluation","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b964e19d2a40e57e0238fe027b268a0c9d20adc4","","2020"

It is well documented that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause hypoxemia and thrombophilia in patients, both of which may contribute to the development of NAION. It is uncertain whether the association of NAION and COVID-19 was causal or coincidental but the purpose of this case report is to argue that there is biological plausibility and to help shed light on potential ophthalmologic complications of COVID-19.","","","","1468a3add9bf289c7b1f8f83ddfa17fe391936dc","","","","","","A Case of Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy with COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1468a3add9bf289c7b1f8f83ddfa17fe391936dc","","2020"

"1683",":Paper","CC-BY-ND","Carotid body glomus cells are multimodal arterial chemoreceptors able to sense and integrate changes in several physical and chemical parameters in the blood. These cells are also essential for O2 homeostasis. Glomus cells are prototypical peripheral O2 sensors necessary to detect hypoxemia and to elicit rapid compensatory responses (hyperventilation and sympathetic activation). The mechanisms underlying acute O2 sensing by glomus cells have been elusive. Using a combination of mouse genetics and single-cell optical and electrophysiological techniques, it has recently been shown that activation of glomus cells by hypoxia relies on the generation of mitochondrial signals (NADH and reactive oxygen species), which modulate membrane ion channels to induce depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and transmitter release. The special sensitivity of glomus cell mitochondria to changes in O2 tension is due to Hif2α-dependent expression of several atypical mitochondrial subunits, which are responsible for an accelerated oxidative metabolism and the strict dependence of mitochondrial complex IV activity on O2 availability. A mitochondrial-to-membrane signaling model of acute O2 sensing has been proposed, which explains existing data and provides a solid foundation for future experimental tests. This model has also unraveled new molecular targets for pharmacological modulation of carotid body activity potentially relevant in the treatment of highly prevalent medical conditions.","","","","268f7e42814ca8dc7a4861b345c84c2e4b6c9f49","","","","","","Molecular Mechanisms of Acute Oxygen Sensing by Arterial Chemoreceptor Cells.

Infected individuals exhibit unpredictable symptoms that tend to worsen if age is advanced, a state of malnutrition persists, or if cardiovascular comorbidities are present. Once transmitted, the virus affects the lungs and in predisposed individuals can elicit a sequela of fatal cardiovascular consequences. We aim to present the pathophysiology of COVID-19, emphasizing the major cellular and clinical manifestations from a cardiological perspective. As a roaming viral particle or more likely via the Trojan horse route, SARS-CoV-2 can access different parts of the body. Cardiovascular features of COVID-19 can count myocardial injuries, vasculitis-like syndromes, and atherothrombotic manifestations. Deviations in the normal electrocardiogram pattern could hide pericardial effusion or cardiac inflammation, and dispersed microthrombi can cause ischemic damages, stroke, or even medullary reflex dysfunctions. Tailored treatment for reduced ejection fraction, arrhythmias, coronary syndromes, macrothrombosis and microthrombosis, and autonomic dysfunctions is mandatory. Confidently, evidence-based therapies for this multifaceted nevertheless purely cardiological COVID-19 will emerge after the global assessment of different approaches.","","","","d853c65712470a3e582c63404f6833a871ce1abc","","","","","","SARS-CoV-2 Aiming for the Heart: A Multicenter Italian Perspective About Cardiovascular Issues in COVID-19","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d853c65712470a3e582c63404f6833a871ce1abc","","2020"

"1690",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus attacks multiple organs of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, including the brain. There are worldwide descriptions of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease. As many as 55% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been reported to have neurological disturbances three months after infection by SARS-CoV-2. The mutability of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its potential to directly affect the CNS highlight the urgency of developing technology to diagnose, manage, and treat brain injury in COVID-19 patients. The pathobiology of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated neurological sequelae of this infection remain poorly understood. In this review, we outline the rationale for the use of blood biomarkers (BBs) for diagnosis of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, the research needed to incorporate their use into clinical practice, and the improvements in patient management and outcomes that can result. BBs of brain injury could potentially provide tools for detection of brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Elevations of BBs have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of COVID-19 patients. BB proteins have been analyzed in CSF to detect CNS involvement in patients with infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculous meningitis. BBs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnosis of mild versus moderate traumatic brain injury and have identified brain injury after stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and epilepsy. BBs, integrated with other diagnostic tools, could enhance understanding of viral mechanisms of brain injury, predict severity of neurological deficits, guide triage of patients and assignment to appropriate medical pathways, and assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients.","","","","4187d53f261a39c34b90e59ebfa5374d4d032c6a","","","","","","Blood Biomarkers for Detection of Brain Injury in COVID-19 Patients","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4187d53f261a39c34b90e59ebfa5374d4d032c6a","","2020"

"1697",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Abstract Background The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared SARS-CoV-2 as pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 present mainly with respiratory symptoms. Prone position has been traditionally used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to improve oxygenation and prevent barotrauma in ventilated patients. Awake proning is being used as an investigational therapy in COVID to defer invasive ventilation, improve oxygenation, and outcomes. Hence, we conducted a retrospective case study to look for benefits of awake proning with oxygen therapy in non-intubated COVID patients. Materials and methods A retrospective case study of 15 COVID patients admitted from June 15 to July 1, 2020 to HDU in our hospital was conducted. Cooperative patients who were hemodynamically stable and SpO2 < 90% on presentation were included. Oxygen was administered through facemask, non-rebreathing mask and noninvasive ventilation to patients as per requirement. Patients were encouraged to maintain prone position and target time was 10–12 hours/day. SpO2 and P/f ratio in supine and prone position was observed till discharge. Primary target was SpO2 > 95% and P/f > 200 mm Hg. Other COVID therapies were used according to institutional protocol. Results The mean SpO2 on room air on admission was 80%. In day 1 to 3, the mean P/f ratio in supine position was 98.8 ± 29.7 mm Hg which improved to 136.6 ± 38.8 mm Hg after proning (p = 0.005). The difference was significant from day 1 to 10. Two patients were intubated. The mean duration of stay was 11 days. Conclusion Awake prone positioning showed marked improvement in P/f ratio and SpO2 in COVID-19 patients with improvement in clinical symptoms with reduced rate of intubation. Highlights Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation by reducing V/Q mismatch. Awake prone positioning has been used along with high-flow oxygen therapy in recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus for management of mild to moderate cases.

We report three cases of symptomatic patients that required intensive care management with labs and imaging consistent with COVID-19 with initial false-negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing. Improper sampling, viral load, and manufacturer variances of tests all contribute to reduced sensitivity.

"1699",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has created a worldwide pandemic. Many patients with this infection have an asymptomatic or mild illness, but a small percentage of patients require hospitalization and intensive care. Patients with respiratory tract involvement have a spectrum of presentations that range from scattered ground-glass infiltrates to diffuse infiltrates with consolidation. Patients with the latter radiographic presentation have severe hypoxemia and usually require mechanical ventilation. In addition, some patients develop multiorgan failure, deep venous thrombi with pulmonary emboli, and cytokine storm syndrome. The respiratory management of these patients should focus on using low tidal volume ventilation with low intrathoracic pressures. Some patients have significant recruitable lung and may benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and/or prone positioning. There is no well-established anti-viral treatment for this infection; the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma and remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In addition, randomized trials have demonstrated that dexamethasone improves outcomes in patients on mechanical ventilators or on oxygen. There are ongoing trials of other drugs which have the potential to moderate the acute inflammatory state seen in some of these patients. These patients often need prolonged high-level intensive care. Hospitals are confronted with significant challenges in patient management, supply management, health care worker safety, and health care worker burnout.","","","","03ac4dc7d0478a77e565564fb7da8785fb6a92ce","","","","","","Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Secondary to Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03ac4dc7d0478a77e565564fb7da8785fb6a92ce","","2020"

The influence of hARF severity on patients’ outcomes is still poorly understood. Design Observational, prospective, multicentre study. Setting Three academic hospitals in Milan (Italy) involving three respiratory high dependency units and three general wards. Participants Consecutive adult hospitalised patients with a virologically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients aged <18 years or unable to provide informed consent were excluded. Interventions Anthropometrical, clinical characteristics and blood biomarkers were assessed within the first 24 hours from admission. hARF was graded as follows: severe (partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) <100 mm Hg); moderate (PaO2/FiO2 101–200 mm Hg); mild (PaO2/FiO2 201–300 mm Hg) and normal (PaO2/FiO2 >300 mm Hg). Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the assessment of clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality based on the severity of respiratory failure. Secondary outcomes were intubation rate and application of continuous positive airway pressure during hospital stay. Results 412 patients were enrolled (280 males, 68%). Median (IQR) age was 66 (55–76) years with a PaO2/FiO2 at admission of 262 (140–343) mm Hg. 50.2% had a cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of mild, moderate and severe hARF was 24.4%, 21.9% and 15.5%, respectively. In-hospital mortality proportionally increased with increasing impairment of gas exchange (p<0.001). The only independent risk factors for mortality were age ≥65 years (HR 3.41; 95% CI 2.00 to 5.78, p<0.0001), PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤200 mm Hg (HR 3.57; 95% CI 2.20 to 5.77, p<0.0001) and respiratory failure at admission (HR 3.58; 95% CI 1.05 to 12.18, p=0.04). Conclusions A moderate-to-severe impairment in PaO2/FiO2 was independently associated with a threefold increase in risk of in-hospital mortality. Severity of respiratory failure is useful to identify patients at higher risk of mortality.

Consensus suggestions can standardise care, thereby improving outcomes and facilitating future research. Methods An International Task Force was composed and agreement regarding courses of action was measured using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. 70% agreement was necessary to make a consensus suggestion. Results The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3 months. The Task Force was unable to reach sufficient agreement to yield consensus suggestions for the post-hospital care of COVID-19 survivors. The Task Force fell one vote shy of suggesting routine screening for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions The Task Force addressed questions related to pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19 and the post-hospital care of survivors, yielding several consensus suggestions. Management options for which there is insufficient agreement to formulate a suggestion represent research priorities. For patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia who require oxygen support, the International Task Force made suggestions for remdesivir and dexamethasone, but against hydroxychloroquine.

"1709",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Purpose To investigate the role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in assessing intubation timing for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Materials and methods Seventy-two patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were admitted to a makeshift intensive care unit (ICU). All patients underwent bedside lung ultrasonography one to two times per day. The patients were either intubated, treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or given high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after a discussion with the multidisciplinary group after their conditions worsened. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed daily after intubation, and patients received mechanical ventilation. Lung ultrasound was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after patients were admitted to the ICU; if the patient was intubated, LUS determination was performed before intubation within 24 h (T1) and on days 1, 2, 5, and 7 after intubation (T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively).The goal of this study was to evaluate the severity of lung aeration loss in intubated and non-intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by ultrasound at different time points within one week. Results A total of 16 patients were included in this study, including nine who were intubated and mechanically ventilated and seven patients without intubation. The number of elderly individuals in the intubated group was higher than in the non-intubated group (P < 0.05). In addition, there were more male than female patients in both groups. Patient characteristics (BMI, SOFA, and PaO2/FiO2 value) were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). The 28-day mortality rate of intubated patients was higher than that of non-intubated patients; six patients in the intubated group and two patients in the non-intubated group died. Nine intubated patients showed changes in LUS within seven days (n = 9). The mean LUS within 24 h before intubation was 12.8 ± 1.3. LUS was significantly higher on T1 than on T5 (P <0.05), and did not significantly differ from T1 to T4. Comparing LUS between intubated and non-intubated patients on T1 showed that the LUS of intubated patients was significantly higher than that of non-intubated patients (P <0.05). Between the two patient groups, oxygenation index was 140.1 ± 7.7 vs. 137.8 ± 5.9 on T1, and the respiratory rate of the two groups was 26 ± 5 vs. 28 ± 4 breaths/min. Neither oxygenation index nor RR significantly differed between the two groups. Conclusion LUS may be an effective tool for assessing intubation timing in critically ill patients with Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia.","","","","f79bda8b72ae03bf3ddef06fe5c9f8e910b40439","","","","","","Lung ultrasound score in establishing the timing of intubation in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia: A preliminary retrospective observational study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f79bda8b72ae03bf3ddef06fe5c9f8e910b40439","","2020"
"1710",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Background: Outpatient COVID-19 has been insufficiently characterized. Objective: To determine the progression of disease and subsequent determinants of hospitalization. Design: A prospective outpatient cohort. Setting: Outpatients were recruited by phone between April 21 to June 23, 2020 after receiving outpatient or emergency department testing within a large health network in Maryland, USA. Participants: Outpatient adults with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: Symptoms, portable pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate, and temperature were collected by participants on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after enrollment. Baseline demographics, comorbid conditions were evaluated for risk of subsequent hospitalization using negative binomial, logistic, and random effects logistic regression. Results: Among 118 SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients, the median age was 56.0 years (IQR, 50.0 to 63.0) and 50 (42.4%) were male. Among those reporting active symptoms, the most common symptoms during the first week since symptom onset included weakness/fatigue (67.3%), cough (58.0%), headache (43.8%), and sore throat (34.8%). Participants returned to their usual health a median of 20 days (IQR, 13 to 38) from the symptom onset, and only 65.5% of respondents were at their usual health during the fourth week of illness. Over 28 days, 10.9% presented to the emergency department and 7.6% required hospitalization. Individuals at the same duration of illness had a 6.1 times increased adjusted odds of subsequent hospitalization per every percent decrease in home SaO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41 to 31.23, p=0.02). Limitations: Severity and duration of illness may differ in a younger population. Conclusion: Symptoms often persisted but uncommonly progressed to hospitalization. Home SaO2 might be an important adjunctive tool to identify progression of COVID-19.","","","","2fea833ffd266e7eb5817a3e47928ae06163c3ed","","","","","","The Clinical Course of COVID-19 in the Outpatient Setting: A Prospective Cohort Study","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fea833ffd266e7eb5817a3e47928ae06163c3ed","","2020"
"1711",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Reviews of COVID-19 CT imaging along with postmortem lung biopsies and autopsies indicate that the majority of patients with COVID-19 pulmonary involvement have secondary organising pneumonia (OP) or its histological variant, acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia, both well-known complications of viral infections. Further, many publications on COVID-19 have debated the puzzling clinical characteristics of ‘silent hypoxemia’, ‘happy hypoxemics’ and ‘atypical ARDS’, all features consistent with OP. The recent announcement that RECOVERY, a randomised controlled trial comparing dexamethasone to placebo in COVID-19, was terminated early due to excess deaths in the control group further suggests patients present with OP given that corticosteroid therapy is the first-line treatment. Although RECOVERY along with other cohort studies report positive effects with corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, treatment approaches could be made more effective given that secondary OP often requires prolonged duration and/or careful and monitored tapering of corticosteroid dose, with ‘pulse’ doses needed for the well-described fulminant subtype. Increasing recognition of this diagnosis will thus lead to more appropriate and effective treatment strategies in COVID-19, which may lead to a further reduction of need for ventilatory support and improved survival.","","","","d2669554e117e3013609436ca616ff1307e7882f","","","","","","SARS-CoV-2 organising pneumonia: ‘Has there been a widespread failure to identify and treat this prevalent condition in COVID-19?’","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2669554e117e3013609436ca616ff1307e7882f","","2020"

We present a case of a 56-year-old man with COVID-19 who presented to the fever clinic of our institution with fever and cough without any respiratory distress but low oxygen saturation. The patient deteriorated over the next 2 days but eventually recovered of his illness in due course of time.

"1723",":Paper","CC-BY","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the world including India. Management of patients complicated with neurological illness requiring neurocritical care is challenging during this time. Patients with neurological disease may develop COVID-19 infection or there could be independent neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Critically ill neurological patients are more vulnerable to contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, neurological patients with comorbidities and multisystem involvement are at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Though SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the pulmonary system, it can complicate the assessment and management of neurological patients. With increasing COVID-19 numbers, the hospitalizations of both non-COVID and COVID-19 neurological patients will bring significant strain on the hospital and neurocritical care facilities. Streamlining work pattern, understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its impact on neurological function, establishing general and specific neurocritical care management strategies, ensuring protection and well-being of health care providers, and implementing effective infection control policies are key elements of efficient neurocritical care management during this pandemic. This joint position statement and advisory on the practice of neurocritical care during the COVID-19 pandemic by the Neurocritical Care Society of India and the Indian Society of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care has been developed to guide clinicians providing care to the critically ill neurological patients in the neurocritical care unit during the current pandemic. As the situation from this novel disease is rapidly evolving, readers must constantly update themselves with newly emerging evidence to provide the best possible care to the critically ill neurological patients.","","","","e4a823be4d2801acdb6c2f8ef71db2549e488ad4","","","","","","The Neurocritical Care Society of India (NCSI) and the Indian Society of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care (ISNACC) Joint Position Statement and Advisory on the Practice of Neurocritical Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4a823be4d2801acdb6c2f8ef71db2549e488ad4","","2020"
"1724",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","As of June 20th, 2020, the Center for Disease Control’s tabulations show more than 2.2 million recorded cases of COVID-19 and nearly 120,000 in deaths in the U.S. ( 1 ) Infected patients present with a wide range of symptoms, from completely asymptomatic to rapidly progressive pneumonia leading to death. Rigorous and widespread testing remains a critical component of strategies for containing this pandemic. The limited availability of molecular diagnostics constrains the use of these technologies to those who present with disease. The current gold standards rely on detection of viral RNA typically by RT-PCR, but such approaches, as commonly implemented, have significant disadvantages. First, the nasopharyngeal swab is uncomfortable and may not be tolerated well by all patients, particularly children or the elderly. Second, false negative rates remain a significant concern, with some RT-PCR tests exhibiting values as high as 15% ( 2 ). Third, swab samples must be collected by trained staff to avoid false negatives or inclusive tests ( 3 , 4 ). Fourth, samples must be transported via viral medium to centralized laboratory facilities, where delays for rural or remote areas can reach 48 hours or longer ( 5 ). Alternative tests based on antibodies offer some promise, but the appearance of antibodies (IgM and IgG) can lag weeks to months after the initial exposure ( 6 ). Furthermore, positive antibody titers may potentially only reflect prior exposure as opposed to protective immunity. Emerging evidence suggests re-infection by endemic coronaviruses is not atypical, thereby adding complications to protocols for follow-up molecular testing ( 6 , 7 ). The net result is a continuing gap between widespread population level testing and the availability of tests, likely to persist for the foreseeable future ( 8 - 11 ). These circumstances motivate the development of complementary technologies for diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19 infections ( 2 , 12 , 13 ).

This network will be deployed to monitor a population settling in a target area (cities, region, country, etc.). The goal of this system is the detection and early diagnosis of the disease in people infected with the COVID-19 virus, using a device (such as a bracelet or a chest strap). This device collects in real time all the necessary biomedical measurements of a person, including their location, freeing them from any hospitalization or use of complex and expensive equipment. These informations are then transmitted, via a wireless connection, to a regional or national control center which takes care of its storage in a specialized database. This center executes a decision-making algorithm using artificial intelligence and fuzzy inference engine to detect accurately each possible abnormal change in the supervised biomedical signs reflecting risk factor or indicating the appearance of symptoms characterizing COVID-19 disease. In the positive case, the control system triggers a warning alarm concerning this infected person and requests intervention of the competent authorities to take the necessary measures and actions.

This review focuses on the upper truncal deformity. This deformity is discernable by its residual tissue laxity in the upper arm, back, lateral chest, and breast. Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the morbidity of this procedure when these regions are treated in one operative setting. Methods A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent an upper body lift for truncal deformities after massive weight loss by the senior author between August 2006 and December 2019 was performed. Patient comorbidities and demographics, preoperative parameters, operative factors, and minor and major complications were assessed. Results No intraoperative or major complications occurred. The overall complication rate was 71% (20/28), which were all minor and most related to wound breakdown. Using logistical regression analysis, we found that neither BMI nor amount of weight resected contributed to a higher complication rate in this cohort. Simple matching coefficients analysis identified anemia, hypertension, lifetime smoking history, celecoxib use, and multiple concurrent procedures as comorbidities and intraoperative factors with an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Conclusions This review helps define the role of upper body lift in the care of patients with massive weight loss and addresses the morbidity of a comprehensive approach to upper body deformity. Appropriate patient selection, preoperative patient counseling, sound operative technique, and supportive postoperative care can help to avoid adverse outcomes.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an important non-opioid component of this approach. However, besides potential other adverse effects, there has been a longstanding discussion on the potentially harmful effects of NSAIDs on healing after surgery and trauma. This review describes current knowledge of the effects of NSAIDs on healing of bones, cartilage, soft tissue, wounds, flaps and enteral anastomoses. Overall, animal data suggest some potentially harmful effects, but are contradictory in most areas studied. Human data are limited and of poor quality; in particular, there are only very few good randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but many cohort studies with potential for significant confounding factors influencing the results. The limited human data available are not precluding the use of NSAIDs postoperatively, in particular, short-term for less than 2 weeks. However, well-designed and large RCTs are required to permit definitive answers.","","","","1173ea919045e57008a1226e806f81c6e99385e3","","","","","","Do NSAIDs Really Interfere with Healing after Surgery?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1173ea919045e57008a1226e806f81c6e99385e3","","2021"

"1733",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","Research on topical drug delivery relies on reconstructed human skin (RHS) in addition to ex vivo human and animal skin, each with specific physiological features. Here, we compared the penetration of dexamethasone from an ethanolic hydroxyethyl cellulose gel into ex vivo human skin, murine skin, and RHS. For comprehensive insights into skin morphology and penetration enhancing mechanisms, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and stimulated Raman spectromicroscopy (SRS) were combined. STXM offers high spatial resolution with label-free drug detection and is therefore sensitive to tissue damage. Despite differences in sample preparation and data analysis, the amounts of dexamethasone in RHS, detected and quantified by STXM and LC-MS/MS, were very similar and increased during the first 100 min of exposure. SRS revealed interactions between the gel and the stratum corneum or, more specifically, its protein and lipid structures. Similar to both types of ex vivo skin, higher protein-to-lipid ratios within the stratum corneum of RHS indicated reduced lipid amounts after 30 min of ethanol exposure. Extended ethanol exposure led to a continued reduction of lipids in the ex vivo matrixes, while protein integrity appeared to be compromised in RHS, which led to declining protein signals. In conclusion, LC-MS/MS proved the predictive capability of STXM for label-free drug detection. Combining STXM with SRS precisely dissected the penetration enhancing effects of ethanol. Further studies on topical drug delivery should consider the potential of these complementary techniques.","","","","09bc7fbc0266697d9a33e671cf519e7f1cad0a2e","","","","","","Qualifying X-ray and Stimulated Raman Spectromicroscopy for Mapping Cutaneous Drug Penetration.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09bc7fbc0266697d9a33e671cf519e7f1cad0a2e","","2019"

Burn injuries represent a high risk of morbidity and mortality. The wound healing process is complex and requires the participation of different types of cells. Therefore, new biomaterials, which innovate the wound healing process, are being investigated.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to investigate the use of bacterial cellulose both in its pure state and enriched with lidocaine in full-thickness burns in rats.


METHODS
Thirty rats (Wistar) (260 ± 20 gramas) divided into control group (CG), bacterial cellulose membrane group (MG) and bacterial cellulose membrane enriched with lidocaine group (MLG) were used. The burns were induced using a 150°C heated soldering iron, held on the animal neck for 10 seconds. The biomaterial was applied immediately after injury and skin samples were collected on the tenth day of the treatment. The level of significance of p⩽0.05 was used for the conclusion of the statistical analysis.


RESULTS
The groups treated with the biomaterials, a histological pattern compatible with a more advanced repair stage showing skin appendages, mild inflammatory infiltrate, better collagen fiber organization and mild immunostaining COX-2 and MMP-9 was observed, when compared to the control group that did not receive any type of treatment.


CONCLUSION
Thus, was concluded that the bacterial cellulose-based biomaterial both in its pure state and enriched with lidocaine optimizing the full-thickness burn wound healing in rats.","","","","6a076109235ac135e6ddef0f70de28ec7f3ad8b6","","","","","","Bacterial cellulose membrane used as biological dressings on third-degree burns in rats.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a076109235ac135e6ddef0f70de28ec7f3ad8b6","","2017"
"1739",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Aspirin is a generally well‐tolerated drug that is now widely used in aged patients for its antithrombotic action. Aspirin works through several pathways to reduce inflammation, fever and to alter platelet activity. The scientific literature suggests that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes by aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs may be deleterious to normal wound repair processes and result in healing inhibition. However, novel effects of aspirin on other pathways that regulate inflammation and repair have been reported more recently. These pathways, including inhibition of inflammatory second messengers and transcription factor pathways and production of anti‐inflammatory, pro‐resolution factors (lipoxins), provide a possible explanation for beneficial effects of aspirin in chronic wound healing. There have been limited studies to date that provide good evidence to support aspirin use in chronic venous leg ulcers but this may change as we see results from randomized trials that are currently being undertaken. In this article, we look at possible effects that aspirin administration may have on venous leg ulcer healing and the expanding knowledge of potential beneficial effects of aspirin that operate via novel pathways. Though the literature suggests that aspirin treatment and cyclooxygenase inhibition may have deleterious effects in normal healing, it is possible that in chronic wounds that may be trapped in an inflammatory state that aspirin treatment may result in beneficial outcomes.","","","","0d69f0920baa4704365d1daa88323bf014ec1697","","","","","","Aspirin treatment for chronic wounds: Potential beneficial and inhibitory effects","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d69f0920baa4704365d1daa88323bf014ec1697","","2017"

To conduct a review of reported cases of epidermal maturation arrest and to compare their clinical and histological descriptions with that of persistent granulation tissue with a focus on diagnostic methods and response to treatment.


METHODS
The authors performed a literature search within Pubmed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for all reported cases of epidermal maturation arrest under the terms ""epidermal maturation arrest,"" ""epidermal arrest,"" ""epidermal maturation,"" and ""re-epithelialization maturation arrest."" They reviewed the clinical and histological presentation of hypergranulation tissue as well as the evidence for the most widely used treatments.


RESULTS
There is only one case series and one case report of epidermal maturation arrest, and the former gives the most detailed clinical and histological description including response to treatment. The clinical description, histological findings, and response to treatment of all cases are comparable to that of persistent granulation tissue and there is no histological or cytological data provided to support that epidermal maturation arrest exists as a distinct entity.


CONCLUSION
Among the cases of epidermal maturation arrest reported in the literature, there is insufficient evidence that keratinocytes acquired a state of arrest in their migration. Rather, the described cases appear to have been complicated by persistent granulation tissue, a well-known aberration in wound healing.","","","","a1795b260219d64f03fd1ec427d6bcee761e69cf","","","","","","A review of epidermal maturation arrest: a unique entity or another description of persistent granulation tissue?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1795b260219d64f03fd1ec427d6bcee761e69cf","","2014"

In this study, we examined a double paracrine mechanism between keratinocytes and fibroblasts through interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) and an IL‐1‐induced inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using the skin equivalent. The epidermal layer of the skin equivalent expressed high levels of IL‐1α mRNA (IL1A mRNA) and relatively low levels of IL‐1β mRNA (IL1B mRNA). IL1A mRNA was not detected in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also expressed low but not negligible levels of IL1B mRNA only in the presence of keratinocytes. Expression of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 mRNA (PTGS2 mRNA) and production of PGE2 in three‐dimensionally cultured fibroblasts were noticeably stimulated by co‐culture with keratinocytes, whereas PTGS2 mRNA expression in the epidermal layer was very low. In addition, hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15‐(NAD) mRNA was highly expressed in keratinocytes but not in fibroblasts, and exogenous IL‐1β stimulated PTGS2 mRNA expression in the dermal equivalent. The thickness of the epidermal layer and the number of MKI67‐positive keratinocytes in the skin equivalent were decreased by treatment with indomethacin, and the decrease recovered when exogenous PGE2 was added. These results indicate that keratinocytes stimulate their own proliferation through a double paracrine mechanism mediated by IL‐1 and PGE2.","","","","4e6a2e7d0d8ee6876cc94841adc1ca860b2c9a3f","","","","","","Stimulatory effect of fibroblast‐derived prostaglandin E2 on keratinocyte stratification in the skin equivalent","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e6a2e7d0d8ee6876cc94841adc1ca860b2c9a3f","","2014"
"1744",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Background Birch bark has a long lasting history as a traditional medicinal remedy to accelerate wound healing. Recently, the efficacy of birch bark preparations has also been proven clinically. As active principle pentacyclic triterpenes are generally accepted. Here, we report a comprehensive study on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the wound healing properties of a well-defined birch bark preparation named as TE (triterpene extract) as well as the isolated single triterpenes in human primary keratinocytes and porcine ex-vivo wound healing models. Methodology/Principal Findings We show positive wound healing effects of TE and betulin in scratch assay experiments with primary human keratinocytes and in a porcine ex-vivo wound healing model (WHM). Mechanistical studies elucidate that TE and betulin transiently upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cyclooxygenase-2 on gene and protein level. For COX-2 and IL-6 this increase of mRNA is due to an mRNA stabilizing effect of TE and betulin, a process in which p38 MAPK and HuR are involved. TE promotes keratinocyte migration, putatively by increasing the formation of actin filopodia, lamellipodia and stress fibers. Detailed analyses show that the TE components betulin, lupeol and erythrodiol exert this effect even in nanomolar concentrations. Targeting the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on the activation of Rho GTPases. Conclusion/Significance Our results provide insights to understand the molecular mechanism of the clinically proven wound healing effect of birch bark. TE and betulin address the inflammatory phase of wound healing by transient up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory mediators. Further, they enhance migration of keratinocytes, which is essential in the second phase of wound healing. Our results, together with the clinically proven efficacy, identify birch bark as the first medical plant with a high potential to improve wound healing, a field which urgently needs effective remedies.","","","","65e7f0393bb8677784cb842e98ceb41f416b7e8d","","","","","","From a Traditional Medicinal Plant to a Rational Drug: Understanding the Clinically Proven Wound Healing Efficacy of Birch Bark Extract","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65e7f0393bb8677784cb842e98ceb41f416b7e8d","","2014"
"1745",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Wound healing is a highly coordinated and complex process involving various cell types, chemical mediators and the surrounding extracellular matrix, resulting in a tightly orchestrated re-establishment of tissue integrity by specific cytokines. It consists of various dynamic processes including a series of overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation, re-epithelialization and remodeling. One of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the disturbances in wound healing is an out-of-control inflammatory response that can cause pathological consequences, such as hypertrophic scars, keloids or chronic wounds and ulcers. Recently, several reports have evaluated the effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on tissue repair. In particular, the data analysis supports an anti-inflammatory effect of EMFs by the modulation of cytokine profiles that drive the transition from a chronic pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state of the healing process. In this review, we focus on the effect of EMFs on skin wound healing showing emerging details of the anti-inflammatory effects of EMFs, with a view to cytokines as candidate biomarkers. Molecular clarification of the mechanisms involved in the modulation of inflammatory factors following exposure to EMFs will provide a better understanding of the cellular responses induced by EMFs and a potential, additional treatment in non-responding, chronic wounds.","","","","520b91534a1b17422b47e8a257b137c4b4795d03","","","","","","Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field and wound healing: implication of cytokines as biological mediators.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/520b91534a1b17422b47e8a257b137c4b4795d03","","2013"
"1746",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","BACKGROUND
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin, and food additives (FAs) may exacerbate allergic symptoms in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). Augmentation of histamine release from human mast cells and basophils by those substances is speculated to be the cause of exacerbated allergic symptoms. We sought to investigate the mechanism of action of aspirin on IgE-mediated histamine release.


METHODS
The effects of NSAIDs, FAs or cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors on histamine release from human basophils concentrated by gravity separation were evaluated.


RESULTS
Benzoate and tartrazine, which have no COX inhibitory activity, augmented histamine release from basophils similar to aspirin. In contrast, ibuprofen, meloxicam, FR122047 and NS-398, which have COX inhibitory activity, did not affect histamine release. These results indicate that the augmentation of histamine release by aspirin is not due to COX inhibition. It was observed that aspirin augmented histamine release from human basophils only when specifically activated by anti-IgE antibodies, but not by A23187 or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. When the IgE receptor signaling pathway was activated, aspirin increased the phosphorylation of Syk. Moreover, patients with chronic urticaria and FDEIA tended to be more sensitive to aspirin as regards the augmentation of histamine release, compared with healthy controls.


CONCLUSIONS
Aspirin enhanced histamine release from basophils via increased Syk kinase activation, and that the augmentation of histamine release by NSAIDs or FAs may be one possible cause of worsening symptoms in patients with chronic urticaria and FDEIA.","","","","ddcf9d34e3937c5878387c819b2044d781fc3955","","","","","","Aspirin augments IgE-mediated histamine release from human peripheral basophils via Syk kinase activation.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ddcf9d34e3937c5878387c819b2044d781fc3955","","2013"
"1747",":Paper","CC-BY-SA","Recent findings suggest that modulation of ion channels might be implicated in some of the clinical effects of coxibs, selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Celecoxib and its inactive analog 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, but not rofecoxib, can suppress or augment ionic currents and alter functioning of neurons and myocytes. To better understand these unexpected effects, we have recently investigated the mechanism of inhibition of human Kv2.1 channels by a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-791. In this study we have further explored the SC-791 action on ion channels and heartbeat in Drosophila, which lacks cyclooxygenases and thus can serve as a convenient model to study COX-2-independent mechanisms of coxibs. Using intracellular recordings in combination with a pharmacological approach and utilizing available Drosophila mutants, we found that SC-791 inhibited voltage-activated K+ and L-type Ca2+ channels in larval body-wall muscles and reduced heart rate in a concentration-dependent manner. Unlike celecoxib and several other K+ channel blockers, SC-791 did not induce arrhythmia. Instead, application of SC-791 resulted in a dramatic slowing of contractions and, at higher concentrations, in progressively weaker contractions with gradual cessation of heartbeat. Isradipine, a selective blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, showed a similar pattern of heart arrest, though no prolongation of contractions was observed. Ryanodine was the only channel modulating compound of those tested additionally that was capable of slowing contractions. Like SC-791, ryanodine reduced heart rate without arrhythmia. However, it could not stop heartbeat completely even at 500 µM, the highest concentration used. The magnitude of heart rate reduction, when SC-791 and ryanodine were applied together, was smaller than expected for independent mechanisms, raising the possibility that SC-791 might be interfering with excitation-contraction coupling in Drosophila heart.","","","","9f7f44de57b167b8007d4c084cce035334aea2d3","","","","","","Inhibition of Ion Channels and Heart Beat in Drosophila by Selective COX-2 Inhibitor SC-791","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f7f44de57b167b8007d4c084cce035334aea2d3","","2012"

Effects of CK2 are at least partially linked to signaling via the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, which is dramatically enhanced in colon cancer. Cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2), a Wnt/β‐catenin target gene, has been associated with enhanced cancer progression and metastasis. However, the possibility that a connection may exist between CK2 and COX‐2 has not been explored previously. Here we investigated changes in COX‐2 expression and activity upon CK2 modulation and evaluated how these changes affected cell viability. COX‐2 expression and cell viability decreased upon selective inhibition of COX‐2 with SC‐791 or CK2 with 2‐dimethylamino‐4,5,6,7‐tetrabromo‐1H‐benzimidazole (DMAT), both in human colon (HT29‐ATCC, HT29‐US, DLD‐1) and breast (ZR‐75) cancer cells, as well as in human embryonic kidney (HEK‐293T) cells. On the other hand, ectopic CK2α expression promoted up‐regulation of COX‐2 by activating the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway in HEK‐293T cells. Noteworthy, over‐expression of either CK2α, β‐catenin or COX‐2, as well as supplementation of the medium with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), all were individually sufficient to overcome limitations in cell viability triggered by CK2 inhibition either upon addition of DMAT or over‐expression of a dominant negative CK2α variant. Altogether, these findings provide new insight to the role of CK2 in cancer by up‐regulating COX‐2 expression and thereby PGE2 production. J. Cell.

These include the prevention of immune suppression during the critical perioperative period, and the preclusion of direct promoting effects of catecholamines and prostaglandins on malignant tissue growth. To assess the safety of such pharmacological treatments in the context of oncologic surgery, the current study evaluates wound healing efficacy in the skin, muscle, and colon tissues in rats undergoing colonic anastomosis. Methods: F344 rats were treated daily with a COX-2 inhibitor (etodolac), a b-adrenergic blocker (propranolol), both drugs or vehicles. All rats underwent skin punch biopsy, and half were also subjected to laparotomy and colonic anastomosis. Tensile strength of the abdominal wall and colonic bursting pressure were assessed on Days 3, 7, and 30 postoperatively, and skin biopsy site healing was scored on Days 2, 4, and 6 postoperatively. Results: None of the drug treatments produced any deleterious effects along the expected course of tissue healing. On Day 30, colon bursting pressure showed an abnormal strengthening in animals undergoing anastomosis compared to non-operated animals, across all drug treatments. This abnormal strengthening was attenuated by etodolac. In the skin, surgery reduced healing rate, irrespective of drug treatments. Conclusions: Effective doses of etodolac and propranolol caused no negative effects on wound healing processes in rats. The apparent safety of such treatments, together with their potential clinical benefits, suggests the incorporation of these treatments in oncologic patients undergoing curative tumor resection.","","","","96343f121828c9274ff1628004698e9a5435a16f","","","","","","The effect of β-adrenergic blockade and COX-2 inhibition on healing of colon, muscle, and skin in rats undergoing colonic anastomosis","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96343f121828c9274ff1628004698e9a5435a16f","","2011"
"1755",":Paper","CC-BY","Fetal wound healing occurs rapidly and without scar formation early in gestation. Studying the mechanisms of scarless repair can lead to novel scar‐preventive approaches. In fetal wounds, collagen is deposited early and is fine and reticular with less cross‐linking. Several important differences of fetal vs. postgestational wound‐healing response have been determined, such as the presence of less inflammation, higher hyaluronic acid concentration and a greater ratio of collagen type III to type I. Compared with typical wounds, there are also altered ratios of signaling molecules, such as higher ratios of transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β3 to TGF‐β1 and ‐β2, and matrix metalloproteinases to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Furthermore, fetal fibroblasts do not exhibit TGF‐β1‐induced collagen production compared with their mature counterparts. Patterning genes (homeobox genes) involved in organogenesis are more active in the fetal period and are believed to be the “first domino” in the fetal cutaneous wound repair regulatory cascade. The recommended scar‐preventive agents, such as Scarguard MD®, silicone gel and sheet, Seprafilm® Bioresorbable Membrane, topical hyaluronan, onion extract, oral tamoxifen and 585‐nm pulsed dye laser are reviewed in this study. Despite the lack of supporting evidence, there is a widespread false presumption that the acceleration of healing with the widely assumed scar‐preventive commercial agents is associated with decreased scar formation. Humans are erroneously inclined to make a negative correlation between the healing rate and the degree of scar formation, while such a correlation does not exist in reality. Despite the importance of scar prevention, no FDA‐approved therapy for this purpose is available in the 21st century, which reflects the important challenges, such as the presence of redundant pathways, that these approaches are facing.","","","","030045b715927e33beaff5a7e651b08ce34213d0","","","","","","Strategies for prevention of scars: what can we learn from fetal skin?","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/030045b715927e33beaff5a7e651b08ce34213d0","","2011"

Prostaglandins and EMD may also affect skin healing by targeting dermal fibroblasts (DFs). Thus, we compared the effects of these two agents on the proliferation of hGFs, human gingival keratinocytes (hGKs) and hDFs.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cells from healthy human gingiva or skin were treated with PGE(2) and/or EMD, and proliferation was assessed by measuring cell number and DNA synthesis.


RESULTS
In hGFs, PGE(2) (1 μm) inhibited proliferation while EMD stimulated it. When present together, EMD abolished the PGE(2) -induced inhibition. Serum increased (by a factor of 10) the amount of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), PGE(2) reduced it (by 70-80%) and EMD restored it when present with PGE(2). Prostaglandin E(2) stimulated cAMP production in hGFs while serum or EMD did not. Enamel matrix derivative stimulated hDF proliferation, but the inhibitory effect of PGE(2) was milder than with hGFs. When present together, EMD abolished the PGE(2) -induced inhibition. Enamel matrix derivative inhibited the proliferation of primary hGKs, but PGE(2) had no effect. Finally, we found that hDFs contained about five times less prostaglandin EP(2) receptor mRNA than hGFs, while hGKs contained none.


CONCLUSION
Prostaglandin E(2) inhibits and EMD stimulates hGF proliferation via distinct pathways. The different sensitivities of hDFs and hGKs to PGE(2) can be explained by the levels of EP(2) expression.","","","","e986d4dc8c4ab7f84c0df74bc8d86f01f8ea5548","","","","","","Differential effects of prostaglandin E(2) and enamel matrix derivative on the proliferation of human gingival and dermal fibroblasts and gingival keratinocytes.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e986d4dc8c4ab7f84c0df74bc8d86f01f8ea5548","","2010"

However, the responsible molecular mechanisms of COX inhibition in breast cancer cells remain to be completely elucidated. We examined the effect of the selective COX-1 inhibitor, FR122047 and the selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC791 on cell growth and apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells which exhibited a high basal level of COX-1 expression. Compared to SC791, FR122047 treatment led to a distinct suppression of cell growth in MCF-7 cells. Upon FR122047 treatment, there were apparent increases in the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Our data showed that treatment of caspase-8 inhibitor could significantly suppress the cleavage of the effector caspase-7 and PARP in FR122047-treated MCF-7 cells which are caspase-3-deficient breast cancer cells, indicating that the induction of apoptosis by FR122047 is significantly dependent on caspase-8 activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that the NSAID FR122047 may have an anti-cancer potential in breast cancer.","","","","3edb9a7a02ce7520f6939cc9f40af3cb2ce9db17","","","","","","Induction of cell growth arrest and apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by the COX-1 inhibitor FR122047.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3edb9a7a02ce7520f6939cc9f40af3cb2ce9db17","","2010"

Casualties of radiation dispersal devices, nuclear detonation or major ionizing radiation accidents, in addition to radiation exposure, may sustain physical and/or thermal trauma. Radiation exposure plus additional tissue trauma is known as combined injury. There are no definitive therapeutic agents. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible enzyme expressed in pathological disorders and radiation injury, plays an important role in inflammation and the production of cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and could therefore affect the outcome for victims of combined injury. The COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and meloxicam were evaluated for their therapeutic value against combined injury in mice. In survival studies, the COX-2 inhibitors had no beneficial effect on 30-day survival, wound healing or body weight gain after radiation injury alone or after combined injury. Meloxicam accelerated death in both wounded and combined injury mice. These drugs also induced severe hepatic toxicity, exaggerated inflammatory processes, and did not enhance hematopoietic cell regeneration. This study points to potential contraindications for use of COX-2 inhibitors in patients undergoing therapy for radiation injury and combined injury.","","","","70f33f273bed73b6c0d1df42e2de528f3c0a6391","","","","","","COX-2 Inhibitors Are Contraindicated for Treatment of Combined Injury","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70f33f273bed73b6c0d1df42e2de528f3c0a6391","","2009"

Methods: An extensive review of the English-language literature was conducted using the MEDLINE database. Results: A comprehensive review of the pathophysiology of scarring and scar management, including both emerging and currently available therapies, was completed. Current clinical studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of well-designed controls, and lack of standardized scar outcome measurement parameters. Conclusions: A prominent challenge in the study of scar management is the paucity of well-designed, large, randomized, controlled studies examining existing scar-reducing techniques. The greatest improvement in scar-reducing protocols likely entails a polytherapeutic strategy for management. Further investigation into the role of inflammation in scarring is paramount to the development of improved scar-reducing agents. There is a need for large controlled trials using a polytherapeutic strategy that combines existing and novel agents to provide a standardized evidence-based evaluation of efficacy.","","","","5c7e0275186f8f13367fc5eafb48abcebf4f8f79","","","","","","Scars: A Review of Emerging and Currently Available Therapies","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c7e0275186f8f13367fc5eafb48abcebf4f8f79","","2008"

"1766",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","An essential feature of a healed wound is the restoration of an intact epidermal barrier through wound epithelialization, also known as re-epithelialization. The directed migration of keratinocytes is critical to wound epithelialization and defects in this function are associated with the clinical phenotype of chronic non-healing wounds. A complex balance of signaling factors and surface proteins are expressed and regulated in a temporospatial manner that promote keratinocyte motility and survival to activate wound re-epithelialization. The majority of this review focuses on the mechanisms that regulate keratinocyte migration in the re-epithelialization process. This includes a review of cell attachments via desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and integrins, the expression of keratins, the role of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, eicosanoids, oxygen tension, antimicrobial peptides, and matrix metalloproteinases. Also reviewed are recently emerging novel mediators of keratinocyte motility including the role of electric fields, and signaling via the acetylcholine and beta-adrenergic receptors. These multiple regulators impact the ability of keratinocytes to migrate from the wound edge or other epidermal reservoirs to efficiently re-epithelialize a breach in the integrity of the epidermis. New discoveries will continue to uncover the elegant network of events that result in restoration of epidermal integrity and complete the wound repair process.","","","","80298ae0a69257a550fbad61041a107bc02cd6f8","","","","","","Wound re-epithelialization: modulating keratinocyte migration in wound healing.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80298ae0a69257a550fbad61041a107bc02cd6f8","","2007"

To study the effect of celecoxib (Celebrex; Pfizer, Cambridge, Mass) on (1) primary ischemic time and (2) revascularization of fasciocutaneous free flaps in a rat model.


METHODS
In the ischemia study, 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups of 25 rats each, a control group and a celecoxib group. Five rats in each treatment group were exposed to ischemic times of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours. Survival of the flap was assessed 7 days after reversal of the ischemia. Probit curves and the critical ischemic time were calculated. In the revascularization study, 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups of 15 rats each. One group was fed celecoxib, while the other was fed a normal diet. All rats had a 3 x 6-cm fasciocutaneous flap based on the inferior epigastric artery elevated and exposed to 2 hours of primary ischemia. The flap was then sutured back into the wound bed. Each of these groups was then divided into 3 groups of 5 rats whose pedicles were divided on postoperative day 5, 6, or 7. Percentage survival of the flap was measured 7 days later. In both parts of the study, the experimental group was fed celecoxib, 1500 ppm, throughout the interoperative period. In each animal, a 3 x 6-cm ventral fasciocutaneous groin flap based on the left superficial epigastric artery was elevated.


RESULTS
In the ischemia study, respective flap survival rates from the control and celecoxib groups at the various ischemic times were as follows: 4 hours, 100% and 100%; 6 hours, 80% and 100%; 8 hours, 80% and 80%; 10 hours, 60% and 60%; and 12 hours, 20% and 10%. The median lethal ischemic times were 9.7 and 9.6 hours, respectively. There was no statistical difference in flap survival between the celecoxib and control groups. In the revascularization study, ligation of the flap pedicle on day 5, 6, or 7 did not result in any difference in the percentage of flap survival among the 3 groups.


CONCLUSION
Celecoxib appears to have no deleterious effect on free tissue transfer survival or healing, as evidenced by revascularization in a fasciocutaneous free flap model.","","","","c562bf8853ad48378356c184c5e4aadac7421852","","","","","","Effect of celecoxib on fasciocutaneous flap survival and revascularization.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c562bf8853ad48378356c184c5e4aadac7421852","","2007"
"1768",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","OBJECTIVE
There is evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) delay both epithelialisation and angiogenesis in the early phases of wound healing because of an antiproliferative effect. We investigated the influence of diclofenac, a non-selective NSAID, on incisional wound healing.


METHOD
Ten male Wistar rats were given 5 mg diclofenac per kg bodyweight per day; 10 rats were given placebo pellets. After 10 days, unimpaired healing occurred independently of drug treatment both macroscopically and microscopically. Histomorphometry revealed a significant reduction (p = 0.006) in fibroblasts after diclofenac application (median 3 166 cells per mm2) compared with the placebo group (median 3940 cells per mm2). Epidermal thickness was not statistically different between the two groups.


RESULTS
Diclofenac diminished the amount of fibroblasts in connective tissue, reflecting the known antiproliferative effect of NSAIDs on fibroblasts. Clinical healing was not affected.


CONCLUSION
We recommend short-term diclofenac application for post-surgical and post-traumatic patients with wounds who would benefit from its antiphlogistic and analgesic effect. However, if wound healing is disturbed, the negative effect of diclofenac on fibroblasts should be considered. This is particularly relevant for patients with chronic wounds or conditions such as diabetes which can delay wound healing.","","","","071231fc274b7efbc8fabc80a05d7084d0d2def8","","","","","","The effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug application on incisional wound healing in rats.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/071231fc274b7efbc8fabc80a05d7084d0d2def8","","2007"

Using a murine incisional wound model, we evaluated the effects of SU6668, an inhibitor of the receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), on the healing of skin wounds. Mice were administered vehicle, SU6668 (100 or 400 mg/kg/day, b.i.d.), or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg/day, b.i.d.), and wound healing was monitored histologically and using a tensiometer. SU6668 at a fully efficacious dose of 100 mg/kg/day had no significant effect on the healing process, while at a supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg/kg/day, there were subtle transient histologic changes and slight decreases in tensile strength, suggesting a slight delay in the wound healing process. In conclusion, these data indicate that inhibition of the receptors for VEGF, PDGF, and FGF at levels necessary to inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenograft models does not affect the healing of incisional wounds in mice. Redundant pathways likely compensate for inhibition of VEGF, PDGF, and FGF signaling pathways in the skin healing process.","","","","6d0a90a1efd7a0d466fbb6f25e42561e9d3077c9","","","","","","A Multitargeted Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, SU6668, Does Not Affect the Healing of Cutaneous Full-Thickness Incisional Wounds in SKH-1 Mice","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d0a90a1efd7a0d466fbb6f25e42561e9d3077c9","","2006"

"1773",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Patients with various rheumatologic and inflammatory disease states commonly require drugs known to decrease the inflammatory or autoimmune response for adequate control of their condition. Such drugs include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase (COX)‐2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic response modifiers. These drugs affect inflammation and local immune responses, which are necessary for proper wound healing in the perioperative setting, thereby potentially resulting in undesirable postoperative complications. Such complications include wound dehiscence, infection, and impaired collagen synthesis. The end result is delayed healing of soft tissue and bone wounds. The current literature provides insight into the effect of some of these drugs on wound healing. For certain drugs, such as methotrexate, trials have been conducted in humans and direct us on what to do during the perioperative period. Whereas with other drugs, we must rely on either small‐animal studies or extrapolation of data from human studies that did not specifically look at wound healing. Unfortunately, no clear consensus exists on the need and optimum time for withholding therapy before surgery. Likewise, clinicians are often uncertain of the appropriate time to resume therapy after the procedure. For those drugs with limited or no data in this setting, the use of pharmacokinetic properties and biologic effects of each drug should be considered individually. In some cases, discontinuation of therapy may be required up to 4 weeks before surgery because of the long half‐lives of the drugs. In doing so, patients may experience an exacerbation or worsening of disease. Clinicians must carefully evaluate individual patient risk factors, disease severity, and the pharmacokinetics of available therapies when weighing the risks and benefits of discontinuing therapy in the perioperative setting.","","","","a36c6587b858e107cc16080b1c600cf831a38524","","","","","","Effects of Perioperative Antiinflammatory and Immunomodulating Therapy on Surgical Wound Healing","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a36c6587b858e107cc16080b1c600cf831a38524","","2005"

Summary and Background Data:Intra-abdominal adhesions are the major cause of intestinal obstruction and secondary infertility after surgical procedures. Because adhesion synthesis requires angiogenesis, and cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2) inhibitors have antiendothelial activity, we tested COX-2 inhibitors in a murine model of intra-abdominal adhesion formation. Methods:A silicone patch was secured to the lateral abdominal wall of groups of C57BL/6 mice, followed by cecal abrasion to promote adhesion formation. Beginning on the day of surgery, mice were treated with the selective COX-2 agents, celecoxib or rofecoxib, and the nonspecific COX inhibitors, aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, or indomethacin. Animals were treated for 10 days and killed. A second group (celecoxib, rofecoxib, aspirin) was treated for 10 days and observed for an additional 25 days. After treatment, intra-abdominal adhesions were scored using a standard method. The patch was subjected to immunohistochemistry with the endothelial-specific marker, CD31. Results:Animals treated with selective and nonselective COX-2 inhibitors, except aspirin, had significantly fewer adhesions than control animals. Celecoxib produced a maximal reduction in adhesion formation compared with rofecoxib and the nonselective COX-2 inhibitors at 10 days. After 25 days, celecoxib and rofecoxib, but not aspirin, had fewer adhesions than control mice. Adhesions from mice treated with celecoxib had reduced microvessel density compared with rofecoxib, the nonselective COX inhibitors, and control animals. Conclusions:Selective COX-2 inhibitors, in particular celecoxib, provide durable inhibition of intra-abdominal adhesions through an antiangiogenic mechanism.","","","","bbb10ca68c5b3f47d3dff6e471f3b8ffd64989ff","","","","","","Prevention of Intra-abdominal Adhesions Using the Antiangiogenic COX-2 Inhibitor Celecoxib","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbb10ca68c5b3f47d3dff6e471f3b8ffd64989ff","","2005"

Resolution of the diabetic and impaired wound-healing phenotype by systemic administration of leptin into ob/ob mice increased COX-1 expression in wound margin keratinocytes and decreased COX-2 expression in inner wound areas to levels found in wild-type animals. Notably, improved wound healing was characterized by a marked increase in PGE2/PGD2 biosynthesis that colocalized with induced COX-1 in new tissue at the margin of the wound. COX-2 expression did not significantly contribute to PGE2/PGD2 production in impaired wound tissue. Accordingly, only late wound tissue from SC-560-treated (selective COX-1 inhibitor) but not celecoxib-treated (selective COX-2 inhibitor) ob/ob mice exhibited a severe loss in PGE2, PGD2, and prostacyclin at the wound site, and this change was associated with reduced keratinocyte numbers in the neo-epithelia.

"1782",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The cyclooxygenase isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, are involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2, a major prostaglandin involved in epidermal homeostasis and repair. Cancer originating in the epidermis can develop when keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis become dysregulated, resulting in sustained epidermal hyperplasia. COX-2 inhibitors, which demonstrate significant in vivo selectivity relative to COX-1, suppress both ultraviolet-induced epidermal tumor development and progression, suggesting that prostaglandin regulation of keratinocyte biology is involved in the pathogenesis of epidermal neoplasia. In this study, we characterized the expression of COX-1 and COX-2, as well as keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, following acute ultraviolet irradiation in the hairless SKH-1 mouse. Following acute ultraviolet exposure, COX-2 expression was predominantly induced in the basal keratinocyte layer coincident with an increase in keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis. The role of COX-2 was further evaluated using a selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC-791, as well as the traditional nonsteroidal COX inhibitor, indomethacin. Following acute ultraviolet irradiation, inhibition of COX-2 with either inhibitor decreased epidermal keratinocyte proliferation. Likewise, keratinocyte apoptosis was increased with COX-2 inhibition, particularly in the proliferating basal keratinocyte layer. There was also a modest inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation. These data suggest that COX-2 expression is probably necessary for keratinocyte survival and proliferation occurring after acute ultraviolet irradiation. We hypothesize that selective COX-2 inhibition, as described herein, may lead to enhanced removal of ultraviolet-damaged keratinocytes, thereby decreasing malignant transformation in the epidermis.","","","","c5e952824f03a8ccb7af269818a84abc124350a7","","","","","","Epidermal COX-2 induction following ultraviolet irradiation: suggested mechanism for the role of COX-2 inhibition in photoprotection.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5e952824f03a8ccb7af269818a84abc124350a7","","2003"
"1783",":Paper","CC-BY","The cyclooxygenase isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, are the rate limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2, a major prostaglandin involved in epidermal homeostasis and repair. Epidermal injury results in transient hyperplasia and induction of COX-2 expression. The role of COX-2 in this hyperplasia is unknown, however. In this study, we characterized the epidermal expression of COX isozymes following wounding by abrasion in SKH-1 mice using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and Western analysis. In addition, we evaluated pivotal keratinocyte functions necessary for the reparative hyperplasia, including proliferation by 5-bromo-2′deoxy-uridine labeling and differentiation by the expression of involucrin, keratin 1, and keratin 6. Although COX-1 expression in keratinocytes remained unchanged during wound healing, COX-2 expression was induced coincidentally with keratinocyte proliferation and keratin 6 expression, suggesting a role for COX-2 in epidermal repair. The role of COX-2 was also evaluated using the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-791 and the traditional COX inhibitors indomethacin and diclofenac. Neither inhibitor altered keratinocyte proliferation or differentiation following abrasion, in contrast to dexamethasone, which delayed these responses. Our results indicated that, although COX-2 expression was coincident with transient epidermal hyperplasia and keratinocyte proliferation/differentiation during the healing of epidermal injury, it does not play a pivotal role in this repair process.","","","","7e5a13c5a1ebb5895230026128681b518828d706","","","","","","Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibition Does Not Alter Keratinocyte Wound Responses in the Mouse Epidermis after Abrasion","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7e5a13c5a1ebb5895230026128681b518828d706","","2003"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the methanol crude extract and various fractions of increasing polarity of J. mimosifolia leaves for bioactive metabolites, as well as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. The anti-inflammatory potential of the various fractions of J. mimosifolia leaf extract was studied via the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay. Methanol crude extract (ME), derived fractions extracted with chloroform (CF) and ethyl acetate (EAF), and residual aqueous extract (AE) of dried J. mimosifolia leaves were assayed for polyphenolic compounds, their antioxidant, antimicrobial and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activities, and anticancer properties. Polyphenolic compounds were determined via HPLC while phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and ortho-diphenol contents), antioxidant activities (DPPH, hydrogen peroxideperoxide, hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions) and LOX were measured via spectrophotometry. Methanol extracts and various fractions were evaluated for antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antifungal potential of the fractions was tested against three species: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest values for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonols, tannins and ortho-diphenols were in the ME, followed by CF > EAF > AE. ME also had the highest antioxidant activity with EC50 values 48±1.3, 45±2.4, 42±1.3 and 46±1.3 μg/mL based on the DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical assays, respectively. TPC and TFC showed a significant, strong and positive correlation with the values for each of these antioxidant activities. ME exhibited anti-inflammatory potential based on its LOX inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.3 μg/mL). ME also had the maximum antibacterial and antifungal potential, followed by EAF > CF > AE. Furthermore, ME showed the strongest cytotoxic effect (EC50 = 10.7 and 17.3 μg/mL) against human hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma (LnCaP) and human lung carcinoma (LU-1) cell lines, respectively. Bioactive compounds present in leaf methanol extracts of J. mimosifolia were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Fifteen compounds were identified including phenolic and alcoholic compounds, as well as fatty acids. Our results suggest that J. mimosifolia leaves are a good source of natural products with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties for potential therapeutic, nutraceutical and functional food applications.","","","","ab285a281e113b6331c0bf1d7646f1054b2f81dd","","","","","","GC-MS analysis, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antilipoxygenase and cytotoxic activities of Jacaranda mimosifolia methanol leaf extracts and fractions","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab285a281e113b6331c0bf1d7646f1054b2f81dd","","2020"

This study aimed to investigate the differential expression of 40 inflammatory mediators in patients with CP/CPPS and to demonstrate whether these mediators related to the severity of erectile function. Eighty cases of patients with CP/CPPS were selected, including 40 cases of IIIA and 40 cases of IIIB, with 20 cases of healthy men as controls. After collecting their expressed prostatic secretion, cytokines levels in EPS were determined by ELISA using ELISA kits. The IIEF‐5 questionnaire was used to evaluate erectile function. IIEF‐5 scores were significantly lower in the IIIA and IIIB groups than those in the control group. The expression of IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 was markedly higher in the IIIA and IIIB groups than in the control group. The expression of IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 in the IIIA group was higher than that in the IIIB group. The expression of IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 was negatively correlated with IIEF‐5 scores in both IIIA and IIIB patients. In conclusion, IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 are possible indicators for the clinical diagnosis of CP/CPPS and evaluation of erectile function on patients with CP/CPPS.","","","","02a57a17f722481f3598361a7be074e69d536ba7","","","","","","Correlation of inflammatory mediators in prostatic secretion with chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a57a17f722481f3598361a7be074e69d536ba7","","2018"

"1788",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-SA","The contribution of inflammation to the pathogenesis of tendinopathy and high prevalence of re-injury is not well established, although recent evidence suggests involvement of prostaglandins. We investigated the roles of prostaglandins and inflammation-resolving mediators in naturally occurring equine tendon injury with disease stage and age. Levels of prostaglandins E2 (PGE2), F2α (PGF2α), lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and its receptor FPR2/ALX were analysed in extracts of normal, sub-acute and chronic injured tendons. To assess whether potential changes were associated with altered PGE2 metabolism, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH), COX-2 and EP4 receptor expression were investigated. The ability of tendons to resolve inflammation was determined by assessing FPR2/ALX expression in natural injury and IL-1β stimulated tendon explants. Alterations in the profile of lipid mediators during sub-acute injury included low PGE2 and elevated LXA4 levels compared to normal and chronic injuries. In contrast, PGF2α levels remained unchanged and were three-fold lower than PGE2. The synthetic capacity of PGE2 as measured by the ratio of mPGES-1:PGDH was elevated in sub-acute injury, suggesting aberrations in tendon prostaglandin metabolism, whilst COX-2 and EP4 receptor were unchanged. Paradoxically low tendon PGE2 levels in early injury may be attributed to increased local clearance via PGDH or the class switching of lipid mediators from the prostaglandin to the lipoxin axis. PGE2 is therefore implicated in the development of tendon inflammation and its ensuing resolution. Whilst there was no relationship between age and tendon LXA4 levels, there was an age-associated decline in FPR2/ALX receptor expression with concurrent increased PGE2 levels in injury. Furthermore, uninjured tendon explants from younger (<10 years) but not older horses (≥10 years) treated with IL-1β responded by increasing FPR2/ALX suggesting aged individuals exhibit a reduced capacity to resolve inflammation via FPR2/ALX, which may present a potential mechanism for development of chronic tendinopathy and re-injury.","","","","63213f9f3b12bbe1126c01938f7bb147501c53b7","","","","","","Inflamm-Aging and Arachadonic Acid Metabolite Differences with Stage of Tendon Disease","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63213f9f3b12bbe1126c01938f7bb147501c53b7","","2012"
"1789",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","OBJECTIVE
To review the literature related to severe burn injury (SBI), burn shock, and smoke inhalation injury in domestic animals. Current animal- and human-based research and literature were evaluated to provide an overview of thermal burn classification and the pathophysiology of burn shock and smoke inhalation injury.


ETIOLOGY
Severe burn injury, burn shock, and smoke inhalation injury may be encountered as a result of thermal injury, radiation injury, chemical injury, or electrical injury.


DIAGNOSIS
Burns can be subdivided based on the amount of total body surface area (TBSA) involved and the depth of the burn. Local burn injuries involve <20% of the TBSA whereas SBI involves >20-30% of the TBSA. The modern burn classification system classifies burns by increasing depth: superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, and full-thickness.


SUMMARY
Local burn injury rarely leads to systemic illness whereas SBI leads to significant metabolic derangements that require immediate and intensive management. SBI results in a unique derangement of cardiovascular dysfunction known as ""burn shock."" The physiologic changes that occur with SBI can be divided into 2 distinct phases; the resuscitation phase and the hyperdynamic hypermetabolic phase. The resuscitation phase occurs immediately following SBI and lasts for approximately 24-72 hours. This period of hemodynamic instability is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators, increased vascular permeability, reduced cardiac output, and edema formation. The hyperdynamic hypermetabolic phase begins approximately 3-5 days after injury. This phase is characterized by hyperdynamic circulation and an increased metabolic rate that can persist up to 24 months post burn injury in people.","","","","bb4c20828999a3f25d34befcff3ec428cd272f3e","","","","","","Severe burn injury, burn shock, and smoke inhalation injury in small animals.

"1795",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","Some trauma patients’ monocytes (MO) increase TNF-α levels concomitant to augmenting production of the TNF-α inhibitor prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suggesting posttrauma MO insensitivity to PGE2 effects. This study assesses additional posttrauma MO PGE2 insensitivity effects on altering TNF-α form (membrane versus secreted), down-regulating MO receptor expression, and depressing MO APC function. Posttrauma MO TNF-α insensitivity to exogenous and autocrine PGE2 correlated to accumulation of TNF-α primarily as a membrane-bound cytokine (mTNF-α). MO retention of mTNF-α correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and loss of antigen-presenting cell (APC) function as assessed by depressed MLR and dendritic cell (DC) differentiation. MO TNF-α sensitivity to down-regulation by IL-10 was retained, suggesting that PGE2-related functions are specifically altered in these patients’ MO. Freshly isolated MO from all trauma patients had decreased expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) for gram-negative bacteria. Exogenous PGE2 at high (10−6M) or low (10−8M) concentrations decreased normals’ and further decreased APC-competent patients’ MO TLR4 expression but had no effect on TLR2. Patients’ APC-dysfunctional MO failed to further down-regulate their TLR4 expression in response to additional PGE2, demonstrating another form of PGE2 insensitivity. One of the primary MO prostaglandin receptors, eicosanoid receptor 4 (EP4), was decreased on patients’ APC dysfunctional MO, suggesting that depressed EP4 expression could contribute to PGE2 insensitivity in patients’ MO. The APC dysfunctional MO’s dysregulation of TLR4 expression paralleled increased macrophage-like characteristics such as increased CD64 expression density, elevated mTNF-α production, and increased PGE2 levels. Increased PGE2 levels still decreased patients’ MO APC functions but failed to depress either MO TLR4 expression or mTNF-α levels, suggesting differential involvement of EP receptors in postinjury PGE2-mediated effects.","","","","11f85f8da99fb45dd5290bef644e9e75666286a6","","","","","","ABNORMAL PGE2 REGULATION OF MONOCYTE TNF-α LEVELS IN TRAUMA PATIENTS PARALLELS DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE MACROPHAGE-LIKE PHENOTYPE","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11f85f8da99fb45dd5290bef644e9e75666286a6","","2004"

"1798",":Paper","CC-BY-NC-ND","Prostaglandin (PG) E(2) is a principal downstream mediator of fever and other symptoms of systemic inflammation. Its inactivation occurs in peripheral tissues, primarily the lungs and liver, via carrier-mediated cellular uptake and enzymatic oxidation. We hypothesized that inactivation of PGE(2) is suppressed during LPS fever and that transcriptional downregulation of PGE(2) carriers and catabolizing enzymes contributes to this suppression. Fever was induced in inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats by intravenous LPS (50 microg/kg); the controls received saline. Samples of the liver, lungs, and hypothalamus were harvested 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 h postinjection. The expression of the two principal transmembrane PGE(2) carriers (PG transporter and multispecific organic anion transporter) and the two key PGE(2)-inactivating enzymes [15-hydroxy-PG dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and carbonyl reductase] was quantified by RT-PCR. All four genes of interest were downregulated in peripheral tissues (but not the brain) during fever. Most remarkably, the expression of hepatic 15-PGDH was decreased 26-fold 5 h post-LPS, whereas expression of pulmonary 15-PGDH was downregulated (as much as 18-fold) throughout the entire febrile course. The transcriptional downregulation of several proteins involved in PGE(2) inactivation, first reported here, is an unrecognized mechanism of systemic inflammation. By increasing the blood-brain gradient of PGE(2), this mechanism likely facilitates penetration of PGE(2) into the brain and prevents its elimination from the brain.","","","","651dffc7ea281910f5aa15f4b0c16f4ec1dc2887","","","","","","Expression of genes controlling transport and catabolism of prostaglandin E2 in lipopolysaccharide fever.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/651dffc7ea281910f5aa15f4b0c16f4ec1dc2887","","2003"
"1799",":Paper","CC-BY-NC","The febrile response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) consists of three phases (phases I-III), all requiring de novo synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E(2). The major mechanism for activation of PGE(2)-synthesizing enzymes is transcriptional upregulation. The triphasic febrile response of Wistar-Kyoto rats to intravenous LPS (50 microg/kg) was studied. Using real-time RT-PCR, the expression of seven PGE(2)-synthesizing enzymes in the LPS-processing organs (liver and lungs) and the brain ""febrigenic center"" (hypothalamus) was quantified. Phase I involved transcriptional upregulation of the functionally coupled cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and microsomal (m) PGE synthase (PGES) in the liver and lungs. Phase II entailed robust upregulation of all enzymes of the major inflammatory pathway, i.e., secretory (s) phospholipase (PL) A(2)-IIA --> COX-2 --> mPGES, in both the periphery and brain. Phase III was accompanied by the induction of cytosolic (c) PLA(2)-alpha in the hypothalamus, further upregulation of sPLA(2)-IIA and mPGES in the hypothalamus and liver, and a decrease in the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in all tissues studied. Neither sPLA(2)-V nor cPGES was induced by LPS. The high magnitude of upregulation of mPGES and sPLA(2)-IIA (1,257-fold and 133-fold, respectively) makes these enzymes attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapy.","","","","b3292ec0e544fded990f49f47f6b933ddd5bf61a","","","","","","Prostaglandin E(2)-synthesizing enzymes in fever: differential transcriptional regulation.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3292ec0e544fded990f49f47f6b933ddd5bf61a","","2002"
