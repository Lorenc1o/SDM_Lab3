Miss place summer let election personal send cell.;FullPaper;Abstract In high-altitude environments, the oxygen and air density are decreased, and the temperature and humidity are low. When individuals enter high-altitude areas, they are prone to suffering from acute mountain sickness (AMS) because they cannot tolerate hypoxia. Headache, fatigue, dizziness, and gastrointestinal reactions are the main symptoms of AMS. When these symptoms cannot be effectively alleviated, they can progress to life-threatening high-altitude pulmonary edema or high-altitude cerebral edema. If the risk of AMS can be effectively assessed before people enter high-altitude areas, then the high-risk population can be promptly discouraged from entering the area, or drug intervention can be established in advance to prevent AMS occurrence and avoid serious outcomes. This article reviews recent studies related to the early-warning biological indicators of AMS to provide a new perspective on the prevention of AMS.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11b60341785330211c1668397816de586d069a6a

Cultural sure bag child dinner everyone. Ground think professor lead.;Poster;Maximal values of aerobic power (VO2max) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2max) decline in parallel with gain in altitude. Whereas this relationship has been well investigated when acutely exposed to high altitude, potential benefits of acclimatization on SpO2 and related VO2max in healthy and diseased individuals have been much less considered. Therefore, this narrative review was primarily aimed to identify relevant literature reporting altitude-dependent changes in determinants, in particular SpO2, of VO2max and effects of acclimatization in athletes, healthy non-athletes, and patients suffering from cardiovascular, respiratory and/or metabolic diseases. Moreover, focus was set on potential differences with regard to baseline exercise performance, age and sex. Main findings of this review emphasize the close association between individual SpO2 and VO2max, and demonstrate similar altitude effects (acute and during acclimatization) in healthy people and those suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, in patients with ventilatory constrains, i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steep decline in SpO2 and V̇O2max and reduced potential to acclimatize stress the already low exercise performance. Finally, implications for prevention and therapy are briefly discussed.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42f7beeeaf3293796349d101cf3d8b35fab8e6ee

Southern part within Mrs pull.;ShortPaper;A 42-year-old pediatric intensive care unit physician traveled to Nepal and took a helicopter trip to Everest Base Camp. The helicopter reached an altitude of 5500 m during flight and descended at different destinations with varying altitudes. At Hotel Everest View at 3820 m, his oxygen saturation was 79%. He had mild tachypnea and deep breathing but was able to walk around, jump, and take photographs. He returned to Kathmandu (altitude, 1324 m) without using any supplemental oxygen during the entire trip. Based on calculations with the alveolar gas equation, he observed that he and his fellow passengers probably had hypoxemia during the trip. In summary, temporary hypoxemia associated with high altitude in healthy individuals without cardiorespiratory compromise may not require oxygen therapy. In contrast, intensive care unit patients who have respiratory failure may have similar oxygen saturation levels but may require oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. The oxygen saturation level must be interpreted in consideration of the clinical scenario before deciding about the need for oxygen therapy.;Yes;No;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e222e32d307c2017787f7cd4b5627f7e87fc6c7

Numerous molecular mechanisms affect appropriate acclimatization to hypobaric and/or normobaric hypoxia and curtail the development of HAIs. The understanding of these mechanisms is essential to optimize hypoxic acclimatization for efficient prophylaxis and treatment of HAIs. This review aims to link outcomes of molecular mechanisms to either adverse effects of acute high-altitude/hypoxia exposure or the developing tolerance with acclimatization. After summarizing systemic physiological responses to acute high-altitude exposure, the associated acclimatization, and the epidemiology and pathophysiology of various HAIs, the article focuses on molecular adjustments and maladjustments during acute exposure and acclimatization to high altitude/hypoxia. Pivotal modifying mechanisms include molecular responses orchestrated by transcription factors, most notably hypoxia inducible factors, and reciprocal effects on mitochondrial functions and REDOX homeostasis. In addition, discussed are genetic factors and the resultant proteomic profiles determining these hypoxia-modifying mechanisms culminating in successful high-altitude acclimatization. Lastly, the article discusses practical considerations related to the molecular aspects of acclimatization and altitude training strategies.;No;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0399235ae3ec234e97c40347f2344037616c4229

Despite significant welfare concerns, carbon dioxide exposure remains the most common killing method, primarily because there is no practical and humane alternative. We explored whether hypobaric hypoxia via gradual decompression could induce a non-recovery state in anesthetized male C57BL/6 and Balb/c laboratory mice. We aimed to determine if this was possible in a feasible timescale with minimal pathological consequences, as a proof-of-principle step. Systematic evaluation of two decompression rates (75, 150 ms−1) and three profile shapes (accelerated, linear, gradual) in a factorial design revealed that hypobaric hypoxia effectively induced a non-recovery state in anesthetized laboratory mice, irrespective of decompression rate and shape. Mice took longer to reach a non-recovery state with the 75 ms−1 decompression rate (75 ms−1: 257 ± 8.96 vs. 150 ms−1: 214 ± 7.26 s), with longer latencies in gradual and linear shaped profiles. Accelerated shaped profiles were least susceptible to meaningful refinement via rate. The only pathological changes of concern were moderate middle ear congestion and hemorrhage. These findings suggest that hypobaric hypoxia has potential, and subsequent work will evaluate the welfare consequences of gradual decompression in conscious mice, to identify decompression profiles that minimize welfare harms associated with ear barotrauma.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19e0c857753713185495d8b3d1b3299923270eec

Owner Mr recent nothing statement bank despite lay. Try rather stop by shoulder.;Poster;Introduction: In military aviation during high-altitude operations, an oxygen or cabin pressure emergency can impair brain function and performance. There are variations in individuals’ physiological responses to low partial pressure of oxygen and hypoxia symptoms can vary from one exposure to another. The aim of this study was to evaluate how normobaric hypoxia (NH) affects pilots’ minute ventilation and 10 min afterwards on Instrument Landing System (ILS) flight performance in Hawk simulator during a tactical flight sortie. Methods: Fifteen volunteer fighter pilots from the Finnish Air Force participated in this double blinded, placebo controlled and randomized study. The subjects performed three flights in a tactical Hawk simulator in a randomized order with full flight gear, regulators and masks on. In the middle of the flight without the subjects’ knowledge, 21% (control), 8% or 6% oxygen in nitrogen was turned on. Minute ventilation (VE) was measured before, during NH and after NH. Forehead peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), wireless ECG and subjective symptoms were documented. The flights were conducted so that both subjects and flight instructors were blinded to the gas mixture. The pilots performed tactical maneuvers at simulated altitude of 20,000 ft or 26,000 ft until they recognized the symptoms of hypoxia. Thereafter they performed hypoxia emergency procedures with 100% oxygen and returned to base (RTB). During the ILS approach, flight performance was evaluated. Results: The mean VE increased during NH from 12.9 L/min (21% O2 on the control flight) to 17.8 L/min with 8% oxygen (p < 0.01), and to 21.0 L/min with 6% oxygen (p < 0.01). Ten minutes after combined hyperventilation and hypoxia, the ILS flight performance decreased from 4.4 (control flight) to 4.0 with 8% oxygen (p = 0.16) and to 3.2 with 6% oxygen (p < 0.01). A significant correlation (r = -0.472) was found between the subjects’ VE during 6% oxygen exposure and the ILS flight performance. Discussion: Hyperventilation during NH has a long-lasting and dose-dependent effect on the pilot’s ILS flight performance, even though the hypoxia emergency procedures are executed 10 min earlier. Hyperventilation leads to body loss of carbon dioxide and hypocapnia which may even worsen the hypoxia hangover.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64c505d537f10eb4f573d7fee1f8a18d7660d175

Herself strong form list., Want mean move then.;DemoPaper;It has been well established that very-high-altitude (>4000 m) environments can affect human cognitive function and brain activity. However, the effects of long-term exposure to moderate altitudes (2000–3000 m) on cognitive function and brain activity are not well understood. In the present cross-sectional study, we utilized an N-back working memory task and resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine the effects of two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude on working memory and resting-state brain activity in 208 college students, compared with a control group at the sea level. The results showed that there was no significant change in spatial working memory performance after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. In contrast, the analysis of resting-state brain activity revealed changes in functional connectivity patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. These results suggest that long-term exposure to moderate altitudes has no observable effect on spatial working memory performance, while significant changes in functional connectivity and brain network properties could possibly occur to compensate for the effects of mild hypoxic environments. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the resting state activity in the PFC associated with working memory in people exposed to moderate altitudes.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46c6bdc5eed10d1cb531eb5456b9eef33bda2281

Try day prove plan.;Poster;Mild degrees of hypoxia are known to exert a detrimental effect on cognitive functions. In a lab study, we assessed the effect of mild hypoxia on risk-taking behavior. Participants (N = 25) were presented with pairs of bets of equal expected monetary value, one having a higher probability of winning/losing a lower payoff (safer bet) and one having a lower probability of winning/losing a higher payoff (riskier bet). We systematically varied the ratio of the probabilities (and corresponding payoffs) of the two bets and examined how this affected participants’ choice between them. Following a familiarization session, participants performed the task twice: once in a normoxic environment (20.9% oxygen concentration) and once in a mildly hypoxic environment (14.1% oxygen concentration). Participants were not told and could not guess which environment they were in. We found a higher preference for the riskier bet in the mild hypoxic than normoxic environment but only in the loss domain. Furthermore, as the probability ratio increased, mild hypoxia increased the preference for the riskier bet in the domain of losses but decreased it for gains. The present findings support that mild hypoxia promotes riskier choices in the loss domain and provide new insights into the impact of mild hypoxia in moderating the effect of probability ratio on risky choices.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff112646c50032bffff5315cbbe3e37983e7ba72

Epidemiological evidence implicated that prolonged exposure to hypoxia leads to neurological damage and a plethora of complications. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are a promising tool for neurological damage therapy in terms of their unique properties. However, the literature on the outcome of NSCs exposed to severe hypoxia is scarce. In this study, we identified a responsive gene that reacts to multiple cellular stresses, marked cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP), which could attenuate NSC apoptosis under hypoxic pressure. Interestingly, ISRIB, a small-molecule modulator of the PERK-ATF4 signaling pathway, could prevent the reduction and apoptosis of NSCs in two steps: enhancing the expression of CIRBP through the protein kinase R- (PKR-) like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) axis. Taken together, CIRBP was found to be a critical factor that could protect NSCs against apoptosis induced by hypoxia, and ISRIB could be acted upstream of the axis and may be recruited as an open potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat hypoxia-induced brain hazards.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/614bb3a4c93dde41c019e523642090a119ac092c

Twenty healthy participants (10 females and 10 males, 27.6±6.2yrs, 73.6±13.7kg, 175.3±8.9cm) completed a cognitive performance test, followed by the modified Harvard-step protocol, in four environments: normobaric normoxia (NN; PiO2: 146.0±1.5mmHg), NH (PiO2: 100.9±1.3mmHg), HH at the first day of ascent (HH1: PiO2 = 105.6±0.4mmHg) and HH after an overnight stay (HH2: PiO2 = 106.0±0.5mmHg). At rest and/or exercise, SpO2, NIRS, and cardiovascular and perceptual data were collected. The cerebral tissue oxygenation index and the cognitive performance (throughput, accuracy, and reaction time) were not different between the hypoxic conditions (all p>0.05). In NH, SpO2 was higher compared to HH1 (ΔSpO2 NH vs HH1: 1.7±0.5%, p = 0.003) whilst heart rate (ΔHR NH vs HH2: 5.8±2.6 bpm, p = 0.03) and sympathetic activation (ΔSNSi NH vs HH2: 0.8±0.4, p = 0.03) were lower in NH compared to HH2. Heart rate (ΔHR HH1 vs HH2: 6.9±2.6 bpm, p = 0.01) and sympathetic action (ΔSNSi HH1 vs HH2: 0.9±0.4, p = 0.02) were both lower in HH1 compared to HH2. In conclusion, cognitive performance and cerebral oxygenation didn’t differ between the hypoxic conditions. SpO2 was only higher in NH compared to HH1. In HH2, heart rate and sympathetic activation were higher compared to both NH and HH1. These conclusions account for a PiO2 between 100–106 mmHg.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6beaabaef7983591bf8824a78cba38199c8dba9a

We hypothesized that machine learning would enable us to classify the response patterns and provide new insights into the common response patterns between subjects. In total, 32 healthy subjects (15 men and 17 women, age: 25.5 ± 4.3 years) were exposed to two different light colors (red vs. blue) in a randomized cross-over study design for 9 min while performing a VFT. We used the systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) approach to measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics and oxygenation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VC) concurrently with systemic physiological parameters. We found that subjects were suitably classified by unsupervised machine learning into different groups according to the changes in the following parameters: end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial oxygen saturation, skin conductance, oxygenated hemoglobin in the VC, and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the PFC. With hard clustering methods, three and five different groups of subjects were found for the blue and red light exposure, respectively.

Complicated pipelines or lines increase the burden on patients and inconvenience for medical personnel. Currently, many commercial devices provide related functionalities. However, most devices measure only one biological signal, which can increase the budget for users and cause difficulty in remote integration. In this study, we develop a wearable device that integrates electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), and blood oxygen machines for medical applications with the hope that it can be applied in the future. We develop an integrated multiple-biosignal recording system based on a modular design. The developed system monitors and records EEG, ECG, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals for health purposes simultaneously in a single setting. We use a logic level converter to connect the developed EEG module (BR8), ECG module, and SpO2 module to a microcontroller (Arduino). The modular data are then smoothly encoded and decoded through consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS). This developed system has passed simulation tests and exhibited proper functioning of all modules and subsystems. In the future, the functionalities of the proposed system can be expanded with additional modules to support various emergency or ICU applications.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed1caca55bbad1aa6e00b40842c0896bb457c346

When compared with the low-altitude individuals, the reaction time of mental rotation tasks was significantly slower in immigrants who had lived in high-altitude areas for 3 years. The time–frequency analysis showed that the alpha ERD and the beta ERD within the time window (400–700 ms) were decreased during the mental rotation tasks in these immigrants. The decreased ERD was observed at the parietal–occipital regions within the alpha band and at the central–parietal regions within the beta band.

Potential CVC related complications include mechanical and infectious complications., , , OBJECTIVE, To determine type, incidence and risk factor of CVC related complications in pediatric patients., , , MATERIAL AND METHOD, Prospective observational study of all patients who underwent CVC in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, over a 1-year period., , , RESULTS, The study included 137 patients, of whom 63.5% were males. The mean age was 36.7 ± 4.4 months. There were 204 CVC attempts with total indwell time of 2,002 days. The rate of mechanical complication was 19%, including failure to place catheter (9.3%), hematoma (4.9%), arterial puncture (2%) and pneumothorax (1.5%). Patient body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, internal jugular venous catheterization, and longer insertion time (> 30 minutes) were associated with high mechanical complication rates. The incidence density of catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was 7.5/1,000 catheter-days. Femoral vein placement had significant higher incidence of CRBSI., , , CONCLUSION, CVC related complications are comparable to previous studies. Risk factors of mechanical complications include high BMI, internal jugular venous catheterization and longer insertion time.

The study was divided into the preintervention (October–December 2018), 3-month postintervention (January–March 2019), and 6-month postintervention (April–June 2019) phases. Risk difference and Poisson regression analyses were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the intervention. Results The hospital-wide central line-related bloodstream infection rate decreased from 10.0/1,000 catheter-days to 4.5/1,000 catheter-days at 3-month postintervention (P=0.39) and to 1.4/1,000 catheter-days at 6-month postintervention (P=0.047). The central line occlusion rate significantly decreased from 30% to 12.8% (P=0.04) and 8.3% (P=0.002) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Approximately 7% of CVADs became dislodged during the preintervention phase versus 8.5% (P=0.364) and 3.3% (P=0.378) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Conclusion Reinforcing CVAD care bundles with direct feedback could significantly decrease CVAD-associated complications in terms of infection at 6-month postintervention, and occlusion at 3- and 6-month postintervention. Thus, reinforcement and regular direct feedback might improve care quality in children with CVADs.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1223ddfa85a489cc101bac931092649cf20f494a

Live soldier agency family. Memory organization someone.;ShortPaper;Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common syndrome characterized by headache, dizziness, loss of appetite, weakness, and nausea. As a major public health issue, obesity has increased in high altitude urban residents and intermittent commuters to high altitudes. The present study investigated acute hypoxic exposure and hypoxic exercise on hypoxemia severity and AMS symptoms in a physically active obese man. In this case analysis, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was used to evaluate hypoxemia, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were used to reflect the function of autonomic nervous system (ANS), and Lake Louise scoring (LLS) was used to assess AMS. The results showed that acute hypoxic exposure led to severe hypoxemia (SpO2 = 72%) and tachycardia (HRrest = 97 bpm), and acute hypoxic exercise exacerbated severe hypoxemia (SpO2 = 59%) and ANS dysfunction (HRpeak = 167 bpm, SBP/DBP = 210/97 mmHg). At the end of the 6-h acute hypoxic exposure, the case developed severe AMS (LLS = 10) symptoms of headache, gastrointestinal distress, cyanosis, vomiting, poor appetite, and fatigue. The findings of the case study suggest that high physical activity level appears did not show a reliable protective effect against severe hypoxemia, ANS dysfunction, and severe AMS symptoms in acute hypoxia exposure and hypoxia exercise.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/227e9fcd1b444d1ac837d254f66bcc587397ba10

Head message anything relate.;FullPaper;Objectives: Pediatric obesity is highly prevalent and has been associated with poor outcomes for hospitalized children. Vascular access is essential in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether critically ill children with obesity are more likely to undergo vascular device insertion (excluding peripheral IV catheters) and develop related complications. Design: Multi-institutional retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Ninety-four U.S. PICUs included in the Virtual Pediatric Systems, LLC database. Patients: 120,272 unique patients 2 to less than 18 years old admitted between January 2009 and December 2014. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients were categorized into normal weight, overweight, and obese (class 1, 2, or 3); underweight patients were excluded. We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression to test body mass index category as an independent predictor of vascular device placement and associated complications, adjusted for age, sex, severity of illness, primary diagnosis, presence of a complex chronic condition, and admission related to trauma or surgery. A total of 73,964 devices were placed in 45,409 patients (37.8% of the total cohort received a vascular device). Most device types placed differed significantly by weight status. Subjects with class 3 obesity were less likely (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81) to undergo placement of any device compared with normal weight patients. Patients with all classes of obesity were more likely to undergo placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter, with the strongest association in those with class 2 obesity (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14–1.40). Class 1 and class 3 obesity were independent risk factors for developing a complication, with odds ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.11–1.53) and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.07–1.99), respectively. Conclusions: Severe obesity is associated with decreased overall likelihood of placement of a vascular access device but increased likelihood of peripherally inserted central catheter placement and of device-related complications.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/050bba5a066bd9566d2068ef3ac54453967a241b

Low action seat.;ShortPaper;Decreased oxygen saturation (SO2) at high altitude is associated with potentially life-threatening diseases, e.g., high-altitude pulmonary edema. Wearable devices that allow continuous monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), such as the Garmin Fēnix® 5X Plus (GAR), might provide early detection to prevent hypoxia-induced diseases. We therefore aimed to validate GAR-derived SpO2 readings at 4559 m. SpO2 was measured with GAR and the medically certified Covidien Nellcor SpO2 monitor (COV) at six time points in 13 healthy lowlanders after a rapid ascent from 1130 m to 4559 m. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis served as the criterion measure and was conducted at four of the six time points with the Radiometer ABL 90 Flex. Validity was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Bland–Altman plots. Mean (±SD) SO2, including all time points at 4559 m, was 85.2 ± 6.2% with GAR, 81.0 ± 9.4% with COV, and 75.0 ± 9.5% with ABG. Validity of GAR was low, as indicated by the ICC (0.549), the MAPE (9.77%), the mean SO2 difference (7.0%), and the wide limits of agreement (−6.5; 20.5%) vs. ABG. Validity of COV was good, as indicated by the ICC (0.883), the MAPE (6.15%), and the mean SO2 difference (0.1%) vs. ABG. The GAR device demonstrated poor validity and cannot be recommended for monitoring SpO2 at high altitude.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/752c8b64d7206c68a0387200400763de3201559f

Magazine debate instead become.;Poster;The myths surrounding women’s participation in sport have been reflected in respiratory physiology. This study aims to demonstrate that continuous monitoring of blood oxygen saturation during a maximal exercise test in female athletes is highly correlated with the determination of the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) or anaerobic threshold (AnT). The measurements were performed using a pulse oximeter during a maximum effort test on a treadmill on a population of 27 healthy female athletes. A common behavior of the oxygen saturation evolution during the incremental exercise test characterized by a decrease in saturation before the aerobic threshold (AeT) followed by a second significant drop was observed. Decreases in peripheral oxygen saturation during physical exertion have been related to the athlete’s physical fitness condition. However, this drop should not be a limiting factor in women’s physical performance. We found statistically significant correlations between the maximum oxygen uptake and the appearance of the ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2), the desaturation time, the total test time, and between the desaturation time and the VT2. We observed a relationship between the desaturation time and the VT2 appearance. Indeed, a linear regression model between the desaturation time and the VT2 appearance can predict 80% of the values in our sample. Besides, we suggest that pulse oximetry is a simple, fairly accurate, and non-invasive technique for studying the physical condition of athletes who perform physical exertion.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15761ced0f1581438ee9af64533347b9a98b27c0

Local Problem: Despite intermittent improvements in CLABSI rates within our facility, long-term sustainment has been challenging. Methods: This was a quality improvement project including a collaborative rounding approach supported by specialty nursing roles. Interventions: In addition to implementing a variety of evidence-based interventions, the rounding team performed audits to assess performance and created focused education tools to address the identified opportunities within each individual unit. Results: High levels of engagement as evidenced by increased audit completion resulted in CLABSI reductions. However, 2 peaks in CLABSI rates were associated with higher volumes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalizations and decreased audits.

This paper contributes to this area with studies of the effect of face masks and respirators on blood oxygen concentration, breathing frequency, and the heart rate changes. Experimental data sets include 296 segments of their total length of 60 hours, recorded on a home exercise bike under different motion conditions. Wearable instruments with oximetric, heart rate, accelerometric, and thermal camera sensors were used to fill the own database of signals recorded with selected sampling frequencies. The proposed methodology includes fundamental signal and image processing methods for signal analysis and machine learning tools for labeling image components and detecting facial temperature changes. Results show the minimal effect of mask wearing on blood oxygen concentration but its substantial influence on the breathing frequency and the heart rate. The use of a respirator substantially increased the respiratory rate for the given set of experiments under the load. This indicates how wearable sensors, computational intelligence, and machine learning can be used for motion monitoring and data analysis of signals recorded in different conditions.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffdbe58169c08e0d3aab7abdc237dee46872efdb

Hence, a deeper understanding of the measurement errors that can affect precise readings is a key element in clinical decision-making. Several factors may influence the accuracy of pulse oximetry, such as skin color, body temperature, altitude, or patient movement. The skin pigmentation effect on pulse oximetry accuracy has long been studied reporting some contradictory conclusions. Recent studies have shown a positive bias in oxygen saturation measurements in patients with darkly pigmented skin, particularly under low saturation conditions. This review aims to study the literature that assesses the influence of skin pigmentation on the accuracy of these devices. We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to conduct a systematic review retrospectively since February 2022 using WOS, PubMed, and Scopus databases.

In order to evaluate the performance of pulse oximeters during rapidly developing short periods of concurrent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, 13 healthy volunteers underwent 3 breathing phases during outdoor experiments (39 phases in total), monitored simultaneously by five different pulse oximeters. A significant incongruity in values displayed by the tested pulse oximeters was observed, even when the accuracy declared by the manufacturers were considered. In 28.2% of breathing phases, the five used devices did not show any congruent values. The longest uninterrupted congruent period formed 74.4% of total recorded time. Moreover, the congruent periods were rarely observed during the critical desaturation phase of the experiment. The time difference between the moments when the first and the last pulse oximeter showed the typical study endpoint values of SpO2 85% and 75% was 32.1 ± 23.6 s and 24.7 ± 19.3 s, respectively. These results suggest that SpO2 might not be a reliable parameter as a study endpoint, or more importantly as a safety limit in outdoor experiments.

Staff control control cup set religious.;DemoPaper;Dear Sir I read with great interest the article of Ciancarelli et al. (1) entitled ‘Helicobacter pylori infection and migraine’ and I fully agree with their conclusion that ‘in the absence of any specific link between H. pylori and migraine, the association, when present, must be considered as merely casual’. In a recent study (2, 3), a group of 31 children (median age 12 years) suffering from migraine with (n = 21) or without (n = 10) aura, who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society, underwent endoscopic oesophageal gastric and duodenal biopsy in order to determine whether the complaints were of gastrointestinal origin. Twenty-nine (93.5%) of the 31 children with migraine were found to have an underlying inflammatory lesion (e.g. duodenitis, gastritis, or oesophagitis, separately or combined), which would explain their complaints. Helicobacter pylori colonization was found in seven of the children: one had H. pylori-associated antral and corporal gastritis and six had H. pylori-associated antral gastritis only. Gastritis of the corpus without H. pylori was present in all six children. The data, which are consistent with those found in children with recurrent abdominal pain (4, 5), do not support the concept that H. pylori is a primary pathogen for the inflammatory changes seen in these children; nor do they establish an association between H. pylori antral gastritis and migraine. Our histological findings, however, which are similar to those found in children with recurrent abdominal pain (4, 5), strongly suggest that upper gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis not only of recurrent abdominal pain (5) but also of migraine. Further evidence to support this contention is provided by the data collected during our trial, which showed that ranitidine and tripotassium dicitratobismuthate, with or without antibiotics, were more effective than placebo in the management of children with migraine. How the inflammatory changes produce the attacks of migraine is unknown. The effect on mucosa nerve endings of tissue hormones (bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, substance P, leukotrienes, or prostaglandins) generated or released in the presence of inflammation, tissue necrosis, ischaemia and hypoxia is the main mechanism by which inflammation produces abdominal pain. Whether upper gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation seen in children studied could produce attacks of abdominal pain by means of this mechanism and subsequently migraine, possibly by the passage of minute amounts of the aforementioned vasoactive chemical substances into the blood stream (6), is an open question. In conclusion, our findings do not support that H. pylori is a primary pathogen of inflammatory changes seen in children studied, nor do they establish an association between H. pylori antral gastritis and migraine. However, our data strongly suggest that there is a gastrointestinal origin of these patients’ complaints.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51e6b213ec1f1e72a94314281783b808f6cc4d6a

High husband key wife that we social cell.;Poster;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is often praised for its portability and robustness towards motion artifacts. While an increasing body of fNIRS research in real-world environments is emerging, most fNIRS studies are still conducted in laboratories, and do not incorporate larger movements performed by participants. This study extends fNIRS applications in real-world environments by conducting a single-subject observational study of a yoga practice with considerable movement (Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga) in a participant’s natural environment (their apartment). The results show differences in cognitive load (prefrontal cortex activation) when comparing technically complex postures to relatively simple ones, but also some contrasts with surprisingly little difference.

Stock authority south.;FullPaper;Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that allows to monitor the functional hemoglobin oscillations related to cortical activity. One of the main issues related to fNIRS applications is the motion artefact removal, since a corrupted physiological signal is not correctly indicative of the underlying biological process. A novel procedure for motion artifact correction for fNIRS signals based on wavelet transform and video tracking developed for infrared thermography (IRT) is presented. In detail, fNIRS and IRT were concurrently recorded and the optodes’ movement was estimated employing a video tracking procedure developed for IRT recordings. The wavelet transform of the fNIRS signal and of the optodes’ movement, together with their wavelet coherence, were computed. Then, the inverse wavelet transform was evaluated for the fNIRS signal excluding the frequency content corresponding to the optdes’ movement and to the coherence in the epochs where they were higher with respect to an established threshold. The method was tested using simulated functional hemodynamic responses added to real resting-state fNIRS recordings corrupted by movement artifacts. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure in eliminating noise, producing results with higher signal to noise ratio with respect to another validated method.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4e47d1bdc49359b0cd88f2fea806952b632c569

We aimed to investigate the role the activity of the systemic physiology has on individual variations in the fNIRS data. Thirty-two healthy subjects (17 female, 15 male and age: 25.5 ± 4.3 years) were exposed to blue and red light for 9 min (colored light exposure, CLE) while performing a verbal fluency task (VFT). We found that (i), at the group level, the visual cortex showed a stronger deoxyhemoglobin concentration response during blue light exposure than during red light exposure, and (ii) this relationship was influenced by individually different baseline blood pressure values. Furthermore, we found other correlations between changes in fNIRS signals and changes in systemic physiology. Our study demonstrates the usefulness and necessity of the SPA-fNIRS approach to gain insights into the individual variability of hemodynamic responses measured with fNIRS, especially in the case of an intricate experimental paradigm (i.e., CLE-VFT) as used in our study.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce6128373827df8722f10226495351d943040ed7

Their application for Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI) allows for unobtrusively monitoring one’s cognitive state over time. A particular state relevant in multiple domains is cognitive fatigue, which may impact performance and attention, among other capabilities. The monitoring of this state will be applied in real learning settings to detect and advise on effective break periods. In this study, two functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) wearable devices were employed to build a BCI to automatically detect the state of cognitive fatigue using machine learning algorithms. An experimental procedure was developed to effectively induce cognitive fatigue that included a close-to-real digital lesson and two standard cognitive tasks: Corsi-Block task and a concentration task. Machine learning models were user-tuned to account for the individual dynamics of each participant, reaching classification accuracy scores of around 70.91 ± 13.67 %. We concluded that, although effective for some subjects, the methodology needs to be individually validated before being applied. Moreover, time on task was not a particularly determining factor for classification, i.e., to induce cognitive fatigue. Further research will include other physiological signals and human–computer interaction variables.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc1fcc9e83f1874783d26ccb1e327826376d7005

In this Outlook paper, we explain why an accurate physiological interpretation of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging signals is facilitated when systemic physiological activity (e.g., cardiorespiratory and autonomic activity) is measured simultaneously by employing systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS). The rationale for SPA-fNIRS is twofold: (i) SPA-fNIRS enables a more complete interpretation and understanding of the fNIRS signals measured at the head since they contain components originating from neurovascular coupling and from systemic physiological sources. The systemic physiology signals measured with SPA-fNIRS can be used for regressing out physiological confounding components in fNIRS signals. Misinterpretations can thus be minimized. (ii) SPA-fNIRS enables to study the embodied brain by linking the brain with the physiological state of the entire body, allowing novel insights into their complex interplay. We envisage the SPA-fNIRS approach will become increasingly important in the future.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4053dd6088a02312bcd0c29ad306fa0c411ee7f7

We aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of PPT in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods In this randomised, single-blind, controlled trial, we enrolled hospitalized, non-intubated patients (18 to 75 years with oxygen saturation (Spo2) in free-air breathing ≤90%) with COVID-19 pneumonia at a referral hospital. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PPT (six sessions PPT with breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques) or basic care. The primary outcomes were venous blood O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2) pressures, Spo2, and three-minute walking test (3MWT) that were assessed before and end of sixth session. Secondary outcomes included level of dyspnea, venous blood PH, one-month mortality, three-month mortality and short form-36 (SF-36) after one and three months. The assessor was blinded to the assignment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04357340). Findings In April-May 2020, 40 participants were randomly assigned to PPT or basic care groups. While at the end of intervention, pO2 (adjusted mean difference to baseline measure (AMD) 6.43 mmHg [95%CI 2.8, 10.07], P<0.01), Spo2 (AMD 4.43% [95%CI 2.04, 6.83], P = 0.0011), and 3MTW (AMD 91.44 m [95%CI 68.88, 113.99], P<0.01) were higher in PPT group and basic care group, pCO2 was not improved (AMD -2.1 mmHg [95%CI-6.36, 2.21], P = 0.33). Based on the logistic model adjusted to baseline Spo2, the risks of mortality were reduced 81% ([95%CI: 97% reduction to 30% increase], P = .09) and 84% ([95%CI 74% reduction to 5% increase], P = .06) at one-month and three-month, respectively. There were no significant differences in most SF-36 domains scores after one and three months. No serious adverse event was observed during PPT sessions. Conclusion Early PPT can be considered a safe and relatively effective therapeutic choice for patients with severe COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf19e4d43964c63347e98d3911d0829f1470bc62

Citizen event shake will know responsibility. Federal grow PM.;Poster;The role of hypoxia, vascular endothelial injury, and thrombotic inflammation in worsening COVID-19 symptoms has been generally recognized. Damaged vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in forming in situ thrombosis, pulmonary dysfunction, and hypoxemia. Thrombotic inflammation can further aggravate local vascular endothelial injury and affect ventilation and blood flow ratio. According to the results of many studies, obesity is an independent risk factor for a variety of severe respiratory diseases and contributes to high mechanical ventilation rate, high mortality, and slow recovery in COVID-19 patients. This review will explore the mechanisms by which obesity may aggravate the acute phase of COVID-19 and delay long COVID recovery by affecting hypoxia, vascular endothelial injury, and thrombotic inflammation. A systematic search of PubMed database was conducted for papers published since January 2020, using the medical subject headings of “COVID-19” and “long COVID” combined with the following keywords: “obesity,” “thrombosis,” “endothelial injury,” “inflammation,” “hypoxia,” “treatment,” and “anticoagulation.” In patients with obesity, the accumulation of central fat restricts the expansion of alveoli, exacerbating the pulmonary dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion, inflammatory damage, and lung edema. Abnormal fat secretion and immune impairment further aggravate the original tissue damage and inflammation diffusion. Obesity weakens baseline vascular endothelium function leading to an early injury and pre-thrombotic state after infection. Enhanced procoagulant activity and microthrombi promote early obstruction of the vascular. Obesity also prolongs the duration of symptoms and increases the risk of sequelae after hospital discharge. Persistent viral presence, long-term inflammation, microclots, and hypoxia may contribute to the development of persistent symptoms, suggesting that patients with obesity are uniquely susceptible to long COVID. Early interventions, including supplemental oxygen, comprehensive antithrombotic therapy, and anti-inflammatory drugs, show effectiveness in many studies in the prevention of serious hypoxia, thromboembolic events, and systemic inflammation, and are therefore recommended to reduce intensive care unit admission, mortality, and sequelae.;Yes;No;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2609b49b0f939ce3015d70070187ec78901c8707

Recent works of the literature in steganography have the threat of secret information being retrieved by an anonymous user. Some techniques do not support some image formats for embedding. To overcome the disadvantages associated with the existing algorithms, we proposed encryption-based steganography. Encryption algorithms play vital roles to protect original data from unauthorized access. In this paper, the cover image is separated into RGB components separately. Multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) transformation is applied over the transformed image components. Optimal pixels are selected using Multiobjective Whale Optimization. The secret image is split into RGB components. Encryption using Data Encryption Standard, Advanced Encryption Standard and Signcryption algorithms is performed over R, G and B separated components, respectively. The encrypted image is embedded into the selected pixel point of cover image. Inverse DWT is applied to retrieve the stego image. The results are analyzed to prove low error rate with high secured secret image.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ef4fa3347852c4864923fbcbbc7385bf9dbb758

So, there is a need to have a robust mechanism to ensure the verification of any person before allowing him to access the stored data. So, for purposes of increasing the security level and privacy of users against attacks, cancelable biometrics can be utilized. The principal objective of cancelable biometrics is to generate new distorted biometric templates to be stored in biometric databases instead of the original ones. This paper presents effective methods based on different discrete transforms, such as Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), in addition to matrix rotation to generate cancelable biometric templates, in order to meet revocability and prevent the restoration of the original templates from the generated cancelable ones. Rotated versions of the images are generated in either spatial or transform domains and added together to eliminate the ability to recover the original biometric templates. The cancelability performance is evaluated and tested through extensive simulation results for all proposed methods on a different face and fingerprint datasets. Low Equal Error Rate (EER) values with high AROC values reflect the efficiency of the proposed methods, especially those dependent on DCT and DFrFT. Moreover, a comparative study is performed to evaluate the proposed method with all transformations to select the best one from the security perspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is carried out to test the performance of the proposed schemes with the existing schemes. The obtained outcomes reveal the efficiency of the proposed cancelable biometric schemes by introducing an average AROC of 0.998, EER of 0.0023, FAR of 0.008, and FRR of 0.003.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b2faebbcd6db568420d1565274a2dab61a9f8b0

However, the size of location map required to manage over/under flow blocks increased drastically reducing the overall embedding capacity. In the paper, a new PVO-based separable RDH scheme is proposed using double encryption. The original image is encrypted using chaotic mapping in Phase 1, ensuring that the performance of PVO algorithm in an encrypted domain is similar to that in plain domain. Secret data is embedded in this encrypted image. The embedded image is re-encrypted using additive homomorphism to enhance security.

Materials and Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study on patients requiring prehospital intervention between 11 March 2020 and 4 May 2020. All adult patients in whom a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was suspected by the prehospital physician were included. Patients who presented a prehospital confounding respiratory diagnosis and those who were not eligible for ICU admission were excluded. The main exposure was “Low SpO2” defined as a value < 90%. The primary outcome was 48-h ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were 48-h mortality and 30-day mortality. We analyzed the association between low SpO2 and ICU admission or mortality with univariable and multivariable regression models. Results: A total of 145 patients were included. A total of 41 (28.3%) patients had a low prehospital SpO2 and 21 (14.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU during the first 48 h. Low SpO2 was associated with an increase in ICU admission (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2–10.0), which remained significant after adjusting for sex and age (aOR = 5.2, 95% CI = 1.8–15.4).

Focus plan both enough.;Poster;Background In March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 a pandemic and a major global public health emergency. Mortality from COVID-19 is rapidly increasing globally, with acute respiratory failure as the predominant cause of death. Many patients experience severe hypoxia and life-threatening respiratory failure often requiring mechanical ventilation. To increase safety margins during emergency anaesthesia and rapid sequence intubation (RSI), patients are preoxygenated with a closed facemask with high-flow oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Due to the high shunt fraction of deoxygenated blood through the lungs frequently described in COVID-19 however, these measures may be insufficient to avoid harmful hypoxemia. Preoxygenation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) potentially reduces the shunt fraction and may thus allow for the necessary margins of safety during RSI. Methods and design The INOCOV protocol describes a phase II pharmacological trial of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) as an adjunct to standard of care with medical oxygen in initial airway and ventilation management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 in acute respiratory failure. The trial is parallel two-arm, randomized, controlled, blinded trial. The primary outcome measure is the change in oxygen saturation (SpO2), and the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change in SpO2 following initiation of iNO.

Kid fact possible on open.;ShortPaper;Query by Image Content (QBIC), subsequently known as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), offers an advantageous solution in a variety of applications, including medical, meteorological, search by image, and other applications. Such CBIR systems primarily use similarity matching algorithms to compare image content to get matched images from datasets. They essentially measure the spatial distance between extracted visual features from a query image and its similar versions in the dataset. One of the most challenging query retrieval problems is Facial Sketched-Real Image Retrieval (FSRIR), which is based on content similarity matching. These facial retrieval systems are employed in a variety of contexts, including criminal justice. The difficulties of retrieving such sorts come from the composition of the human face and its distinctive parts. In addition, the comparison between these types of images is made within two different domains. Besides, to our knowledge, there is a few large-scale facial datasets that can be used to assess the performance of the retrieval systems. The success of the retrieval process is governed by the method used to estimate similarity and the efficient representation of compared images. However, by effectively representing visual features, the main challenge-posing component of such systems might be resolved. Hence, this paper has several contributions that fill the research gap in content-based similarity matching and retrieval. The first contribution is extending the Chinese University Face Sketch (CUFS) dataset by including augmented images, introducing to the community a novel dataset named Extended Sketched-Real Image Retrieval (ESRIR). The CUFS dataset has been extended from 100 images to include 53,000 facial sketches and 53,000 real facial images. The paper second contribution is presenting three new systems for sketched-real image retrieval based on convolutional autoencoder, InfoGAN, and Vision Transformer (ViT) unsupervised models for large datasets. Furthermore, to meet the subjective demands of the users due to the prevalence of multiple query formats, the third contribution of the paper is to train and assess the performance of the proposed models on two additional facial datasets of different image types. Recently, the majority of people have preferred searching for brand logo images, but it may be tricky to separate certain brand logo features their alternatives and even from other features in an image. Thus, the fourth contribution is to compare logo image retrieval performance based on visual features derived from each of the three suggested retrieval systems. The paper also presents cloud-based energy and computational complexity saving approaches on large-scale datasets. Due to the ubiquity of touchscreen devices, users often make drawings based on their fantasies for certain object image searches. Thus, the proposed models are tested and assessed on a tough dataset of doodle-scratched human artworks. They are also studied on a multi-category dataset to cover practically all possible image types and situations. The results are compared with those of the most recent algorithms found in the literature. The results show that the proposed systems outperform the recent counterparts.;No;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f15d708bc04f14a186665439bbbbcee0c9b7fdf0

There are various types of features that can be used to detect drowsiness. Detection can be done by utilizing behavioral data, physiological measurements and vehicle-based data. The existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models-based ensemble approach analyzed the behavioral data comprises eye or face or head movement captured by using a camera images or videos.

Several studies based on face recognition were introduced in the past decades, but it has few classification issues in terms of poor performances. Hence, the authors proposed a novel model for face recognition.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed method consists of four major sections such as data acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction and recognition. Initially, the images are transferred into grayscale images, and they pose issues that are eliminated by resizing the input images. The contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) utilizes the image preprocessing step, thereby eliminating unwanted noise and improving the image contrast level. Second, the active contour and level set-based segmentation (ALS) with neural network (NN) or ALS with NN algorithm is used for facial image segmentation. Next, the four major kinds of feature descriptors are dominant color structure descriptors, scale-invariant feature transform descriptors, improved center-symmetric local binary patterns (ICSLBP) and histograms of gradients (HOG) are based on clour and texture features. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) with modified random forest (MRF) model for facial image recognition.FindingsExperimentally, the proposed method performance is evaluated using different kinds of evaluation criterions such as accuracy, similarity index, dice similarity coefficient, precision, recall and F-score results. However, the proposed method offers superior recognition performances than other state-of-art methods. Further face recognition was analyzed with the metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F-score and attained 99.2, 96, 98 and 96%, respectively.Originality/valueThe good facial recognition method is proposed in this research work to overcome threat to privacy, violation of rights and provide better security of data.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/715935f23549d91268fcf676e69ac6855899d0be

Then, adaptively regularized kernel-based fuzzy C means (ARKFCM) is used to segment tumor from the enhanced image along with local ternary pattern combined with selective level set approaches.FindingsThe proposed segmentation algorithm precisely segments the tumor portions from the enhanced images with lower computation cost.

In such algorithms, pixel values of each group must be changed in a way that a predefined function of the pixel group matches the secret digit. The notational system of the secret digits can be every desired number, as well as the size of the pixel groups. In order to preserve the quality of the stego image, it is desired to limit the changes in the pixel groups as much as possible. Therefore, optimum strategies must be found to match the function of the pixel group to the secret digit with the least possible imposed distortion in terms of mean square error. Having been recently found for pixel pairs, such strategies are found for the larger pixel groups by the proposed method in this paper. Among all the strategies providing the similar minimum MSE value, the one is chosen that helps to preserve the histogram of the original image. Optimum strategies found for all notational systems and pixel group sizes make the algorithm flexible for various application with different payloads, while it improves the similar techniques in terms of both MSE reduction and histogram preservation.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18cf28828f7edcc62c895d3f097bc157f9954cb0

In this work, a cancelable biometric framework is introduced to satisfy user data security and keeping the original biometric template safe away from intruders. Thus, our main contribution is presenting a novel authentication framework based on the evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based encryption technique. The suggested framework produces an entirely unrecognized biometric template by hiding the whole discriminative features of biometric templates; this is with exploiting the outstanding characteristics of the employed Genetic operations of the utilized encryption technique. Firstly, the GA initiates its search from a population of templates, not a single template. Secondly, some statistical operators are used to exploit the resulting initial population to generate successive populations. Finally, the crossover and mutation operations are performed to produce the ultimate cancelable biometric templates. Different biometric databases of the face and fingerprint templates are tested and analyzed. The proposed cancelable biometric framework achieves appreciated sensitivity and specificity results compared to the conventional OSH (Optical Scanning Holography) algorithm. It accomplishes recommended outcomes in terms of the AROC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) and the probability correlation distribution between the original biometrics and the encrypted biometrics stored in the database. The experimental results prove that the proposed framework achieves excellent results even if the biometric system suffers from different noise ratios.

Accumulating evidence suggests that pulmonary vascular thickening may be specifically associated with COVID-19, implying a potential tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) virus for the pulmonary vasculature. Genetic alterations that may influence the severity of COVID-19 are similar to genetic drivers of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The pathobiology of the COVID-19-induced pulmonary vasculopathy shares many features (such as medial hypertrophy and smooth muscle cell proliferation) with that of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, the presence of microthrombi in the lung vessels of individuals with COVID-19 during the acute phase, may predispose these subjects to the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. These similarities raise the intriguing question of whether pulmonary hypertension (PH) may be a long-term sequela of SARS-COV-2 infection. Accumulating evidence indeed support the notion that SARS-COV-2 infection is indeed a risk factor for persistent pulmonary vascular defects and subsequent PH development, and this could become a major public health issue in the future given the large number of individuals infected by SARS-COV-2 worldwide. Long-term studies assessing the risk of developing chronic pulmonary vascular lesions following COVID-19 infection is of great interest for both basic and clinical research and may inform on the best long-term management of survivors.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7731e51c8cd9c8393ac5187289ea4bc5bad573c

This research work presents an efficient cancelable biometric recognition framework that exploits an irreversible hybrid encryption algorithm. It incorporates Deoxyribonucleic, Ribonucleic Acid sequence (DNA and RNA) encryption technique, and an evolutionary optimization technique, namely Genetic Algorithms (GAs). These techniques are employed to create completely deformed templates from their original ones. Hence, the main contribution is introducing a novel biometric security framework that achieves unique randomness characteristics using RNA and DNA sequences and the evolutionary GA technique. The proposed framework produces entirely deformed biometric templates by ciphering the main discriminative features of the biometric traits of the authorized clients. It is firstly initialized by creating several encrypted biometric images for the original users with the logistic map. After that, the initially encrypted images are transformed into vectors of a binary array. Then, they are converted to their corresponding introns, and exons, and consequently, their relevant codons are stored in the cloud database. These relevant codons are replaced by new ones after generating encrypted RNA lists. The utilized encryption key for each template is extracted from the original biometric image through excessive permutations between pixels. The GA optimization technique is applied to select the most convenient biometric features. Finally, after employing the GA-based cross-over and mutation operations, the chosen features are used to generate the cancelable biometric traits. To assess the proposed framework, six different biometric databases are considered. These databases are Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) Faces (gray), CASIA v.5 Faces (color), UPOL Iris (gray), Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) Ear (color and gray), Fingerprint, and CASIA Palmprint (color and gray). The security performance of the proposed encryption algorithm is compared to those of recent studies in this field, such as Optical Scanning Holography (OSH) and Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE). The simulation results prove the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of all adopted evaluation metrics. The proposed framework provides high Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AROC) curve that reaches 0.9990, low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.0015, more uniform histograms, high correlation values for genuine users, and completely hidden biometric features. In addition, from the security perspective, the proposed framework achieves good entropy, Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), and Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) values that reach 7.9960, 33.55%, and 99.65%, respectively.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d06a1c50f8489b8e64298b866f455a96c9b5e20

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the rapid uptake of remote monitoring programmes to support people with COVID-19 at home. This review discusses the recent evidence and learning in home oxygen monitoring and therapy from the pandemic. Recent findings Many home oxygen monitoring programmes were established around the world during the pandemic, mostly in high-income countries to support early detection of hypoxaemia and/or early hospital discharge. The characteristics of these programmes vary widely in the type of monitoring (self-monitoring or clinician-monitoring) and the patient risk groups targeted. There is a lack of evidence for benefits on clinical outcomes, including mortality, and on reductions in healthcare utilisation or cost-effectiveness, but programmes are viewed positively by patients. Recent studies have highlighted the potential bias in pulse oximetry in people with darker skin. Summary Recent evidence indicates that home oxygen monitoring therapy programmes are feasible in acute disease, but further research is needed to establish whether they improve patient outcomes, are cost-effective and to understand their equity impact.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36bf15d7d665082462d5b4ddd5b64ff30ad6f80c

As many studies showed conflicting results regarding the use of Non-invasive ventilation in COVID-19-associated ARDS, no unquestionable indications by operational guidelines were reported. The aim of this study was to estimate the use and success rate of Helmet (h) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in COVID-19-associated ARDS in medical regular wards patients and describe the predictive risk factors for its use and failure. In our monocentric retrospective observational study, we included patients admitted for COVID-19 in medical regular wards. hCPAP was delivered when supplemental conventional or high-flow nasal oxygen failed to achieve respiratory targets. The primary outcomes were hCPAP use and failure rate (including the need to use Bilevel (BL) PAP or oro-tracheal intubation (OTI) and death during ventilation). The secondary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death and OTI. We computed a score derived from the factors independently associated with hCPAP failure. Out of 701 patients admitted with COVID-19 symptoms, 295 were diagnosed with ARDS caused by COVID-19 and treated with hCPAP. Factors associated with the need for hCPAP use were the PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 270, IL-6 serum levels over 46 pg/mL, AST > 33 U/L, and LDH > 570 U/L; age > 78 years and neuropsychiatric conditions were associated with lower use of hCPAP. Failure of hCPAP occurred in 125 patients and was associated with male sex, polypharmacotherapy (at least three medications), platelet count < 180 × 109/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 240. The computed hCPAP-f Score, ranging from 0 to 11.5 points, had an AUC of 0.74 in predicting hCPAP failure (significantly superior to Call Score), and 0.73 for the secondary outcome (non-inferior to IL-6 serum levels). In conclusion, hCPAP was widely used in patients with COVID-19 symptoms admitted to medical regular wards and developing ARDS, with a low OTI rate. A score computed combining male sex, multi-pharmacotherapy, low platelet count, and low PaO2/FiO2 was able to predict hCPAP failure in hospitalized patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/074c268f12a8c47ab63b666828b6c676999b8d38

Their class bar wish.;FullPaper;Research on new, experimental immunosuppressive drugs (such as FK 506, rapamycin, RS61443, brequinar sodium and deoxyspergualin) with distinct and diverse modes of action has gathered considerable momentum. This surge of interest dates from reports, in 1987, of the capacity of the novel macrolide antibiotic FK 506 to inhibit selectively, CD4+ T cell activation and the production of IL-2 and other cytokines [1]—a property shared with cyclosporin A (CsA). Despite its enormous contribution to the greatly improved success of organ transplantation over the past decade, CsA is potentially nephrotoxie and exhibits other side effects. Agents with a higher therapeutic index are needed. Another factor, which has promoted development of new immunosuppressive drugs within a traditionally risk-averse pharmaceutical industry, is the proven efficacy of CsA in certain autoimmune diseases with presumed T cell pathogeneses. These disorders include psoriasis, uveitis, insulindependent diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis [2,3] and recently, severe, steroid-dependent asthma [4]. In these conditions, patients previously unresponsive to or intolerant of maximal existing immunosuppressive therapy may respond to CsA. Nevertheless, available therapies for autoimmune disease remain unsatisfactory. In the search for effective, safe, 'new' drugs, which can be used alone or in combination, experimental agents such as FK 506 and RS61443 have already entered the clinic, whilst 'older' drugs, such as rapamycin (a close structural analogue of FK 506) and mycophenolic acid (the active moiety of RS61443) have regained attention in a new light. The inhibitory effects of two antilymphocytic drugs, rapamycin [5] and CP 17193 [6], on experimental autoimmune disease (type 1 diabetes and lupus, respectively) are featured in this issue of Clinical and Experimental Immunology.;Yes;Yes;1992;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6df66bcc7ee4c3fde9f64b01d2bd4085c9ec06e

Thus moment worker policy side remain well.;ShortPaper;The studies discussed in this review suggest that DSG is a potent immunosuppressive agent, with at least some of its activity due to its direct effects on macrophages and B cells. The effects of DSG on macrophages include inhibition of IL-1, chemiluminescence, expression of MHC Class I antigen on the surface, and development of MAF. The agent may well interfere with antigen processing and the discovery of its binding to the heat-shock protein 70 may shed some light on this area. The effects of DSG on B lymphocytes include inhibition of surface Ig expression and B cell differentiation. In addition, however, DSG exhibits some effects on both B and T lymphocytes and is markedly active in blocking both the primary and secondary cytotoxic T cell and antibody-producing cell generation. The agent is relatively nontoxic at the doses in which it exerts these marked effects. Thus, an overall assessment of DSG shows that it may provide immune suppression at levels different from those of immunosuppressive agents already available. Advances in human organ transplantation have for the most part occurred stepwise with the introduction of progressively improved techniques of immunosuppression. Tissue-matching, organ preservation, techniques of transplantation, and surgical post-operative care of organ transplant recipients have all improved over the 30 years since organ transplantation began, but have not been the major factors in the improved survival of both patients and grafts seen at the present time. The initial advance in immunosuppression which made the first organ transplants possible was the finding of the immunosuppressive capabilities of azathioprine (Imuran) and the ability to reverse acute rejection crisis with prednisone. Anti-thymocyte or anti-lymphocyte globulin, introduced in 1966, achieved variable results, with some groups reporting excellent patient and graft survival using this agent. Others using different variations of this drug showed no improvement in results. By the mid-1970s, transplant results had improved at a number of units, with graft survivals of kidney and heart recipients in the 70 percent range at 1 to 2 years. No major progress was reported in most units, however, until the introduction in 1978 of cyclosporine. A major effect of cyclosporine was to create a universal improvement in graft survival in all units surveyed around the world with a 70 to 75 percent one-year cadaver kidney graft survival, representing the basic standard for clinical results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS);No;Yes;1993;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed8f1c270dc0e4f43f9e4cc51bed5d0f6acd329f

But in the case of acute rejection after liver transplantation, DSG was reported effective in just a few cases. From July 1991 to November 2005, 96 patients underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLTx) in our institution. Of them, 9 patients, including 4 ABO incompatible recipients, are presented. Rejection symptoms that did not respond to steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone, 10-20 mg/kg/day for 3 days) and were treated with DSG (3 or 5 mg/kg/day) for 4 to 14 days together with a maintenance dose of the steroid. Among them, five responded to treatment with DSG, two did not respond and the other two patients were not evaluated. Six of the nine patients are symptom free at present. Complications such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were successfully treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor or by platelet transfusion. No recipient died as a direct consequence of the complications induced by DSG. DSG proved effective and safe for some of the LDLTx recipients with steroid-resistant acute rejection but it was not effective for the treatment of accelerated humoral rejection in ABO incompatible recipients.;Yes;No;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a74d2d77462fb327dad78e8be86c4814301dd46

Severe OHSS can be life threatening and requires hospitalization and procedures to reduce the extracellular fluid accumulation. Ovulation induction regimen and patient characteristics such as young age and low body weight have been identified as risk factors for OHSS, and follicle count >20 may be predictive of increased risk for moderate to severe OHSS. Whether any other patient factors are important in this risk equation is unknown., , , CASES, We report on 2 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and other autoimmune diseases who experienced a total of 4 episodes of OHSS, 2 of which were severe., , , CONCLUSION, T1DM, with or without other concomitant autoimmune diseases, may increase the risk for severe OHSS. Awareness of the interaction of preexisting conditions and risk for vascular leak disorders is needed for comprehensive counseling prior to embarking on ovarian stimulation. Preventive measures may be important considerations in this population.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afdbf118fbac47d54a5b442151e730a95b00a7f2

As the IoT devices in the smart grid ecosystem generate a gigantic amount of data that needs to be stored and managed in the cloud server. On the other hand, the stored data in the cloud server can be accessible to a number of data users, therefore the data need authenticity and secrecy. Here, to fulfill the security requirements of such type of communication, signcryption with proxy re-encryption technique is the most suitable option where a semi-trusted third party can alter a ciphertext that has been encrypted for one user into another ciphertext without seeing the original content of the message. However, the existing signcryption with proxy re-encryption schemes for the smart grid environment is suffering from more bandwidth space and greater computational time requirements. Thus, in this paper, we propose a lightweight certificate-based signcryption with a proxy re-encryption (CBSRE) scheme for smart grid based-IoT devices with the intention of reducing the computational and communicational costs. For the security and efficiency of the proposed CBSRE scheme, we used a hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem that uses small parameters with a key size of 80-bits. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides the security requirements of confidentiality (IND-CBSRE-CCA2-I and IND-CBSRE-CCA2-II), unforgeability (EUF-CBSRE-CMA-I and EUF-CBSRE-CMA-II) and forward secrecy. Additionally, we compared our proposed CBSRE scheme with the existing proxy signcryption with re-encryption schemes and the final results show that the new scheme provides strong security with the expanse of minimal computational and communications resources.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81a193358e2d5eb804844ccb6798ed2c125ed462

Lay as no real certainly news.;FullPaper;ABSTRACT Visual cryptography is an encryption technique that decomposes a secret image into multiple shares that are digitally ‘overlapped’ based on logical operations to recover the original secret image. Each individual share cannot reveal clues about the secret image. Existing visual cryptography schemes suffer from problems such as pixel expansion, high computational complexity and poor decryption quality. To overcome these problems, we propose a new 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme for color images based on the binary dragonfly algorithm. The dragonfly algorithm is used to determine optimal color levels for the encryption process, which leads to reconstructed images with the higher quality upon decryption with minimal effect on the overall computational complexity. The proposed scheme is also non-expansible, whereby the share images are of the same size as the original secret image. This leads to reduced memory requirements as well as improved image quality. We analyze the strength of the proposed scheme based on a standard set of metrics which includes an evaluation of its resistance against cryptanalytic attacks, histogram, correlation, entropy and encryption quality. Results show that the proposed visual cryptography scheme has desired properties such as improved recovered image quality, near-ideal statistical characteristics and fast encryption speed, depicting an improvement over existing schemes.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37a128d1b24fe8e584b6f7c7cc6be109624b2f91

The interchange of patient data across health centers addresses the growth of the number of patients and minimizes needless trials. The sharing of medical information helps patient care to accelerate; thus the sharing of health data is a need nowadays. Due to the sharing of information online among healthcare professionals, safety remains a key concern. In a diagnostic method during the COVID-19 pandemic, computer tomography (CT) and X-ray photos play an essential role in the transmission of information to organizations. Steganography techniques of encryption and imaging can be used in order to secure transmission of COVID-19 pictures. This work proposes a novel encryption for COVID-19 diagnostic using the image steganography (EIS-SDT) paradigm for safe data transfer. For the breakdown of images, a discrete multiple-level transformer for EIS-SDT employs the technique for optimizing the pixel selection for MANTA RY Foraging. For secrete image encryption, the EIS-SDT approach employs a dual logistic chaotic map. Additional security for the steganography process is ensured by the implementation of the DLCM-based encryption mechanism. The EIS-SDT model is efficiently performed by thorough simulation results analysis, and the results are analyzed using many assessment parameters. The analysis showed that the EIS-SDT model exceeds existing technology considerably.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9dc0397d53bd5550d0454f1f24b5ccf89d5d7d06

By mere behavioral inference from usage reports, its viable to adjudge the daily routine, location, and the kind of electrical devices of a customer. The collection and transmission of such data raises security concerns. Hence, its vital to secure ESP’s access to a customer’s data. In perspective of this, we introduce a data access control scheme which is suitable for smart grids with secure customer data access. In our scheme, the customer is a data owner while an ESP or other third party stakeholder (TPS) is the data user. A data user can have secure access to a customer’s data via a gateway device such as energy service interface (ESI). The ESI fits in as proxy that re-encrypts data for authorized data users based on the delegation command from the data owner. Here, ESI is unable to acquire plaintext information on the data. Moreover, only authorized data users are eligible for decrypting and verifying the integrity and authentication of data. We achieve the data access control via a certificateless signcryption with proxy re-encryption (CLSPRE) scheme. Detailed security analysis shows that our CLSPRE scheme is secure in the random oracle model (ROM). Moreover, extensive performance evaluation indicates its efficiency with respect to communication overhead and computation complexity.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ba2d46a5033ed9e586c7968aa93231c22be2b2f

Efficiency for the user to upload and download the data in a secure way plays an important role, as users are nowadays performing these actions on all types of devices, including e.g. smartphones. Signing and encryption of the sensitive data before hosting can solve potential security breaches. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient identity based signcryption scheme and add a proxy re-encryption feature to it. This allows users to store signed and encrypted data in the cloud, where the cloud server provider is able to check the authentication but not to derive the content of the message. When another user requests data access, the originator of the message first checks the authorization and then provides the cloud server an encryption key to re-encrypt the stored data, enabling the requesting party to decrypt the resulting ciphertext and to validate the signature. The proposed scheme is based on elliptic curve operations and does not use compute intensive pairing operations, like previous proposals.;No;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c86dc584a197549233f0a96addf0248d4c87c6ac

Teacher piece information leader.;Community amount book tell them information less wear. Chance blood across similar hit.;DemoPaper;Effective software cost estimation significantly contributes to decision-making. The rising trend of using nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms has been seen in software cost estimation problems. The constructive cost model (COCOMO) method is a well-known regression-based algorithmic technique for estimating software costs. The limitation of the COCOMO models is that the values of these coefficients are constant for similar kinds of projects whereas, in reality, these parameters vary from one organization to another organization. Therefore, for accurate estimation, it is necessary to fine-tune the coefficients. The research community is now examining deep learning (DL) as a forward-looking solution to improve cost estimation. Although deep learning architectures provide some improvements over existing flat technologies, they also have some shortcomings, such as large training delays, over-fitting, and under-fitting. Deep learning models usually require fine-tuning to a large number of parameters. The meta-heuristic algorithm supports finding a good optimal solution at a reasonable computational cost. Additionally, heuristic approaches allow for the location of an optimum solution. So, it can be used with deep neural networks to minimize training delays. The hybrid of ant colony optimization with BAT (HACO-BA) algorithm is a hybrid optimization technique that combines the most common global optimum search technique for ant colonies (ACO) in association with one of the newest search techniques called the BAT algorithm (BA). This technology supports the solution of multivariable problems and has been applied to the optimization of a large number of engineering problems. This work will perform a two-fold assessment of algorithms: (i) comparing the efficacy of ACO, BA, and HACO-BA in optimizing COCOMO II coefficients; and (ii) using HACO-BA algorithms to optimize and improve the deep learning training process. The experimental results show that the hybrid HACO-BA performs better as compared to ACO and BA for tuning COCOMO II. HACO-BA also performs better in the optimization of DNN in terms of execution time and accuracy. The process is executed upto 100 epochs, and the accuracy achieved by the proposed DNN approach is almost 98% while NN achieved accuracy of up to 85% on the same datasets.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcbdd03b7f566469ff848a6b34973ddc8194f717

Sensing nodes are frequently deployed in hostile aquatic environments in order to collect data on resources that are severely limited in terms of transmission time and bandwidth. Since underwater information is very sensitive and unique, the authentication of users is very important to access the data and information. UWSNs have unique communication and computation needs that are not met by the existing digital signature techniques. As a result, a lightweight signature scheme is required to meet the communication and computation requirements. In this research, we present a Certificateless Online/Offline Signature (COOS) mechanism for UWSNs. The proposed scheme is based on the concept of a hyperelliptic curves cryptosystem, which offers the same degree of security as RSA, bilinear pairing, and elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) but with a smaller key size. In addition, the proposed scheme was proven secure in the random oracle model under the hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. A security analysis was also carried out, as well as comparisons with appropriate current online/offline signature schemes. The comparison demonstrated that the proposed scheme is superior to the existing schemes in terms of both security and efficiency. Additionally, we also employed the fuzzy-based Evaluation-based Distance from Average Solutions (EDAS) technique to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e86a76d60fc3b625e33eb31b099c2c0d7c90622d

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of IL-4 and IL-10 in prolonged allograft survival induced by T-cell depletion plus DSG. MHC mismatched skin allograft transplantation was performed, using wild-type and three separate knockout (i.e., IL-4–/–, Stat6–/-, or IL-10–/–) mice as recipients. Induction therapy consisted of T-cell depletion and or brief course of DSG. The data demonstrate that monotherapy with T-cell-depleting mAbs or DSG prolonged skin allograft survival, compared to controls, in wild-type Balb/c recipients [median survival time (MST) = 25 and 21 vs. 10 days, p < 0.007]. T-cell depletion plus DSG further augmented skin allograft survival in wild-type animals relative to monotherapy (MST = 35 days vs. 25 and 21 days, p < 0.006 vs. mAbs or DSG only), and was equally effective in IL-4–/– and Stat6–/– recipients. In contrast, combined therapy was no better than monotherapy in IL-10–/– animals (p > 0.05). Furthermore, skin allograft survival after combined therapy was shorter in IL-10–/– versus wild-type recipients (MST 20 and 41 days, respectively, p < 0.001). IL-4-mediated signaling through Stat6 is dispensable for prolonged allograft survival induced by T-cell depletion plus DSG. In contrast, IL-10 appears to be important for prolonged allograft survival induced by combined therapy in this model.;Yes;Yes;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d65a0010daaec5b64344eb3d4c92ec61edf3be36

Result moment since understand show. See sea lead dream., Yet occur environmental join behavior.;FullPaper;Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a molecular chaperone that is expressed in response to stress. In this role, Hsp70 binds to its protein substrates and stabilize them against denaturation or aggregation until conditions improve.1 In addition to its functions during a stress response, Hsp70 has multiple responsibilities during normal growth; it assists in the folding of newly synthesized proteins,2, 3 the subcellular transport of proteins and vesicles,4 the formation and dissociation of complexes,5 and the degradation of unwanted proteins.6, 7 Thus, this chaperone broadly shapes protein homeostasis by controlling protein quality control and turnover during both normal and stress conditions.8 Consistent with these diverse activities, genetic and biochemical studies have implicated it in a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, allograft rejection and infection. This review provides a brief review of Hsp70 structure and function and then explores some of the emerging opportunities (and challenges) for drug discovery. ,  , Hsp70 is Highly Conserved , Members of the Hsp70 family are ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved; for example, the major Hsp70 from Escherichia coli, termed DnaK, is approximately 50% identical to human Hsp70s.9 Eukaryotes often express multiple Hsp70 family members with major isoforms found in all the cellular compartments: Hsp72 (HSPA1A) and heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70/HSPA8) in the cytosol and nucleus, BiP (Grp78/HSPA5) in the endoplasmic reticulum and mtHsp70 (Grp75/mortalin/HSPA9) in mitochondria. Some of the functions of the cytosolic isoforms, Hsc70 and Hsp72, are thought to be redundant, but the transcription of Hsp72 is highly responsive to stress and Hsc70 is constitutively expressed. In the ER and mitochondria, the Hsp70 family members are thought to fulfill specific functions and have unique substrates, with BiP playing key roles in the folding and quality control of ER proteins and mtHsp70 being involved in the import and export of proteins from the mitochondria. For the purposes of this review, we will often use Hsp70 as a generic term to encompass the shared properties of the family members.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ba44b847a6990a7aed573a6a13ae62e75308537

This review considers the clinical utility and side‐effect profiles of immunosuppressants used widely in current practice (e.g., glucocorticoids, azathioprine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and sirolimus) and those agents which are in increasing use or in evaluation (e.g., IL‐2 receptor antibodies, everolimus, FTY720, LEA29Y, and deoxyspergualin). Further consideration is given to the wider drug interactions likely during the use of new immunosuppressant regimens and to our growing awareness of the influences of genetic heterogeneity on drug efficacy and handling. Finally, we consider the new demands being placed on the use of drug monitoring to regulate dosage of this new repertoire of immunosuppressants.;No;Yes;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0b819e8f24808556338c3ec6f24d203acffb70d

It has been, however, reported that some recipients experience late acute rejection, which occurs more than 3 months after transplantation. We herein report a case of late acute rejection that occurred nearly 10 years after liver transplantation. The patient is a 27-year-old male who underwent a living donor liver transplantation when he was 17 years old. At 9 years 6 months after transplantation, the patient presented with the elevated serum levels of liver enzymes and total bilirubin. A liver biopsy showed acute cellular rejection. Steroid bolus therapy was not effective, but we successfully used deoxyspergualin as a rescue therapy. Late acute cellular rejection that occurs nearly 10 years after transplantation has so far been rarely reported. It is generally believed that late acute rejection may be more resistant to treatment and be associated with a higher rate of graft loss, as well being associated with the development of chronic ductopenic rejection. In this report, we have shown that deoxyspergualin is safe and effective for treatment of steroid-resistant late acute rejection, preventing from graft loss of chronic rejection.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3196d0bfd21914683ff83d1683683aa1502bb0c3

It is therefore essential to develop the precise and fast measurement of anti-A and anti-B antibodies (Abs) to prevent humoral rejection in ABO-I liver transplantation. Agglutination titer has been the standard method to measure these Abs, but the interpretation of the results is subject to bias. Here, we have developed an objective and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure anti-A and anti-B Abs. This test requires only a small amount (10 microl) of recipient's serum. We applied the newly developed ELISA to monitor living donor liver transplant recipients and investigated the correlation between ELISA and agglutination titer. The Spearman's correlation coefficient for Abs ranged from 0.461 to 0.812. Moreover, in one case of humoral rejection, the increase of Abs was detected by ELISA one day earlier than by the agglutination titer. In conclusion, our ELISA method proved useful to detect an increase of anti-A and anti-B Abs titers at an early stage, thereby contributing to a prompt treatment of humoral rejection due to ABO-I.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb8f420ba10e0f5613429dd28c1b584d4a54efd6

Thousand picture down set draw.;DemoPaper;Cloud computing is a long-standing dream of computing as a utility, where users can store their data remotely in the cloud to enjoy on-demand services and high-quality applications from a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Thus, the privacy and security of data are of utmost importance to all of its users regardless of the nature of the data being stored. In cloud computing environments, it is especially critical because data is stored in various locations, even around the world, and users do not have any physical access to their sensitive data. Therefore, we need certain data protection techniques to protect the sensitive data that is outsourced over the cloud. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to illustrate all the data protection techniques that protect sensitive data outsourced over cloud storage. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to synthesize, classify, and identify important studies in the field of study. Accordingly, an evidence-based approach is used in this study. Preliminary results are based on answers to four research questions. Out of 493 research articles, 52 studies were selected. 52 papers use different data protection techniques, which can be divided into two main categories, namely noncryptographic techniques and cryptographic techniques. Noncryptographic techniques consist of data splitting, data anonymization, and steganographic techniques, whereas cryptographic techniques consist of encryption, searchable encryption, homomorphic encryption, and signcryption. In this work, we compare all of these techniques in terms of data protection accuracy, overhead, and operations on masked data. Finally, we discuss the future research challenges facing the implementation of these techniques.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b6554b29f54827ed4a11acbc832143adcef7260

Stay although drug early note simply.;FullPaper;WBANs (Wireless Body Area Networks) are frequently depicted as a paradigm shift in healthcare from traditional to modern E-Healthcare. The vitals of the patient signs by the sensors are highly sensitive, secret, and vulnerable to numerous adversarial attacks. Since WBANs is a real-world application of the healthcare system, it’s vital to ensure that the data acquired by the WBANs sensors is secure and not accessible to unauthorized parties or security hazards. As a result, effective signcryption security solutions are required for the WBANs’ success and widespread use. Over the last two decades, researchers have proposed a slew of signcryption security solutions to achieve this goal. The lack of a clear and unified study in terms of signcryption solutions can offer a bird’s eye view of WBANs. Based on the most recent signcryption papers, we analyzed WBAN’s communication architecture, security requirements, and the primary problems in WBANs to meet the aforementioned objectives. This survey also includes the most up to date signcryption security techniques in WBANs environments. By identifying and comparing all available signcryption techniques in the WBANs sector, the study will aid the academic community in understanding security problems and causes. The goal of this survey is to provide a comparative review of the existing signcryption security solutions and to analyze the previously indicated solution given for WBANs. A multi-criteria decision-making approach is used for a comparative examination of the existing signcryption solutions. Furthermore, the survey also highlights some of the public research issues that researchers must face to develop the security features of WBANs.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3d2de2d40822e3f65e3ebd9d57166cccd7fff01

So has blockchain technology. The hierarchical electric power grid has been shifting from a centralized structure to a decentralized structure to achieve higher flexibility and stability, and blockchain technology has been widely adopted in the energy sector to deal with grid management, billing, metering, and so on, because of its nature of decentralization. Here, the aim is to provide a multi‐dimensional review on the technological advances of the blockchain in smart grids. Its corresponding applications based on these advances, including company projects and use cases, are summarized. Furthermore, the security threat issues in smart grids, Ethereum Virtual Machine (i.e. the operating environment of consensus mechanisms), and smart contracts are analysed, with a brief conclusion to manifest the prior tasks in building secure blockchain‐based infrastructures in smart grids. As such, the challenges and features of different protocols and their applicability in each use case are identified to provide an insightful guide for future research studies.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf02635993caca98c8756c4b0fa476d3c2b7b68a

Threat bit five network general that.;Poster;The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended version of the Internet of Things that is acting a starring role in data sharing remotely. These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT’s communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user’s physical condition, which can be detrimental to users’ finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources. Finally, we validate the security of the designed scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks using the AVISPA tool.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58585cb32c6a6f119320cc3274bc5f34038076bd

NDN is well suited for Internet of Things (IoT) which possesses massive applications that dominate the Internet today. It intends to provide named-based routing, in-networking caching, built-in mobility and multicast support as part of its design which leads to a substantial improvement in content delivery/retrieval. Though, this new architecture aches from some new challenges in terms of security. In this article, we seek our attention towards Content Poisoning Attack (CPA). The purpose of CPA is to inject poisoned content with an invalid signature into the NDN-based IoT networks. Unfortunately, none of the existing proposals work effectively when malicious attackers compromise the caches of NDN routers. To prevent this, we proposed a certificateless signature scheme for the preservation of CPA in NDN-based IoT networks. The proposed scheme is formally secure under the security hardness of Hyperelliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (HCDLP) with a security simulation/validation in “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA).” Besides, the formal proof we also compared the designed scheme with some existing solutions to show the cost-efficiency in terms of communication overhead and computation cost. To conclude, a robust deployment on NDN-based IoT networks is shown.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f85ea3758961a503a973815d22b80afbac09cbd7

These smart objects sense and produce a huge amount of data for distribution. The current hostcentric networking paradigm is not that scalable to provide a suitable solution to the idea of IoT. For scalable connectivity and efficient distribution, Named Data Networking (NDN) has been envisioned as a promising solution for future internet architecture. On the other hand, the significant issues regarding the adaptation of NDN with IoT possess security concerns such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and forward secrecy. As IoT is a heterogeneous environment, it demands a different type of security, according to the environmental situation such as public key infrastructure (PKI), identity-based cryptosystem (IBC), and certificateless cryptosystem (CLC). This paper presents a new concept of CLC to IBC heterogeneous generalized signcryption for the first time to fulfil the prime security requirements of NDN-based IoT. The proposed scheme provides the security properties according to situational needs without disturbing the structural policy of NDN. Considering the resource-constrained nature of IoT, we used a lightweight type of elliptic curve called the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem which offers the same level of security as that of bilinear pairing and an elliptic curve cryptosystem using a minimum key size. Further, we compare the proposed scheme with recently proposed identity-based as well as certificateless generalized signcryption schemes, and the results give satisfactory outputs in terms of computational and communication resources. Furthermore, we simulate the proposed scheme with Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA), and the results show that our scheme is valid and safe. Additionally, we provide a practical scenario of the proposed on NDN with an IoT-based smart city.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f055145eb9dd3453111cfbaa2e3c3101a85440bf

Yes company walk green.;FullPaper;Long‐term survival of a concordant xenograft can be achieved by using cyclosporine (CyA) and deoxyspergualin (DSG) for immunosuppression. We have demonstrated in a mouse‐to‐rat heterotopic heart transplantation model that DSG treatment can be stopped after 4 weeks with the grafts remaining beating. In this investigation we have sequentially characterized the morphological changes and infiltrating cells in the transplanted hearts. Graft recipients were killed 9 days, 28 days and 56 days after transplantation. At days 9 and 28, the grafts exhibited a well‐preserved morphology, with infiltrating cells restricted only to the periphery. These cells stained positive for rat MHC class II antigens, the ED1‐macrophage marker and the CD4 antigen, and were thus considered to be macrophages. In comparison, grafts harvested at day 56 had signs of interstitial fibrosis and some arteries showed pronounced intimal thickening. There was a moderate infiltrate of cells both in the peripheral and central parts of the graft, consisting mainly of MHC class II+/CD4+/ED1+ macrophages. Very few T cells and NK cells were noticed. Termination of DSG after 28 days does not trigger a humoral rejection. However, the grafts exhibit morphological changes equivalent to those seen in chronic allograft rejection. In addition, the characteristics of the infiltrating cells conformed with cellular infiltrates associated with chronic allograft rejection. Hence, this model could in the future prove to be useful for studies of mechanisms involved in chronic xenograft rejection.;Yes;Yes;1998;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d0d33e71c3f528e2d28bcd42e42b42373afef75

Eight key they probably old.;FullPaper;BACKGROUND, Day of transplant T cell depletion with anti-CD3 immunotoxin or F(Ab)2 immunotoxin induces stable tolerance to renal allografts in rhesus monkeys given 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG), a NF-kappaB inhibitor that suppresses proinflammatory cytokine (PC) production. Because PC and NF-kappaB are involved in dendritic cell (DC) maturation, we asked if impaired DC maturation and Th2-type cytokine deviation might be related to the synergistic effect of DSG in this novel model., , , METHODS, Immunosuppression was initiated 4 hr before transplanting a major histocompatibility complex mismatched renal allograft. Some groups received a supplemental 5-day course of cyclosporine A or DSG or a 15-day course of DSG. Peripheral lymph nodes were sequentially examined for presence of mature DC. In vitro effects of DSG on PC-induced maturation of DC were also examined., , , RESULTS, Allografts survived without rejection in 87% of recipients given immunotoxin or F(Ab)2 immunotoxin with DSG x 15 days, in 50% with DSG x 5 days, and 0% with cyclosporine A. The longest DSG survivors are >1000 days with normal graft function and tolerance validated, including acceptance of challenge second donor kidneys without treatment. DSG-treated recipients were unique in developing polarized Th2-type plasma cytokines. In DSG recipients, mature DC were significantly reduced in day +5 lymph node biopsies, with complete repopulation by 30 days. In vitro studies verified an inhibitory effect of DSG on DC maturation., , , CONCLUSIONS, The study suggests DSG arrests DC maturation. The unusual synergy of immunotoxin and DSG apparently involves coincidental reduction in lymph node T cell mass and mature DC, a transient circumstance favoring development of stable tolerance.;Yes;Yes;1999;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7e0d66abecf52471cd4ae88110051eda34a8334

The exciting early results of composite tissue allografts (CTA) attracted our attention during the 1980s, when some of the first experimental CTA literature appeared. The recent extraordinary results of clinical CTA grafts, primarily the Louisville and Lyon results, have been highlighted at this meeting. Interestingly, this success followed not long after the first International meeting in Louisville in 1997. This is clearly an exciting new application of transplant techniques to one of the newest and most unique types of transplants. Previous studies used immunosuppression for skin allografting. Early results seem quite exciting and we expect to see a rapid growth of interest and activity in this area. We believe that the entire field would benefit from the novel, highly effective and minimally toxic immune tolerance induction using CD3‐immunotoxin (CD3‐IT) and deoxyspergualin (DSG). © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Although these agents induced only modest anti-rejection activity, they caused serious non-specific bone marrow suppression, impairing host resistance and increasing the incidence of infections. Unlike these non-selective agents, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and sirolimus act more selectively on different stages of the T-lymphocyte (T-cell) and B-lymphocyte (B-cell) activation cycles; however, cyclosporine and tacrolimus are nephrotoxic, whereas sirolimus causes hypertriglyceridaemia. Thus, despite this progress, continued efforts must be made to develop and test new, potentially very selective agents. The agent 15-deoxyspergualin moderately inhibits both mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) but does not affect the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Another drug, FTY720, has a unique action to prevent rejection, by altering the homing of lymphocytes to the lymphoid compartments. The newest members of the family of antiproliferative agents, namely mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide and brequinar, are potentially more selective than their predecessors. However, the most promising agents are produced using antisense technology. This approach involves the design of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; these novel drugs are designed to block allograft rejection by blocking selected messenger RNA (mRNA). This review outlines the mechanisms of action, the limitations of application and the molecular or cellular targets of traditional agents, newly developed drugs and also antisense technology, which is an example of a new application of molecular medicine.;Yes;Yes;2000;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae27ad7ba4c297db9ff9cf7640a69cb7aa76e0f8

This study examined whether LF15-0195 could suppress the induction and progression of rat anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis., , , METHODS, Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was induced in primed rats by the administration of anti-GBM serum. In the first experiment, LF15-0195 was given daily by subcutaneous injection (days 0 to 14) to treat the induction of anti-GBM disease analyzed at day 14. In a second experiment, rats received LF15-0195 as an intervention treatment from days 7 to 28 (continuous therapy) or days 7 to 12 (pulse therapy) to treat the progression of disease assessed at day 28., , , RESULTS, Continuous LF15-0195 treatment during the induction of anti-GBM disease (experiment 1) prevented proteinuria and loss of renal function, and markedly reduced histological kidney lesions and renal fibrosis. LF15-0195 also reduced kidney leukocyte infiltrate, urine excretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and the serum antibody response, but not kidney deposition of Ig and C3. When LF15-0195 treatment was initiated at day 7, both continuous and pulse therapy partially inhibited disease progression by suppressing the loss of renal function, interstitial macrophage and T-cell accumulation, tubular cell proliferation, and renal fibrosis., , , CONCLUSION, LF15-0195 prevents the induction and suppresses the progression of rat anti-GBM disease through multiple mechanisms of action, suggesting that this drug may have significant therapeutic potential in human glomerulonephritis. The similar efficacy of continuous and pulse intervention treatment in this model indicates that short-term LF15-0195 treatment may achieve optimal benefit without prolonged bone marrow suppression.;Yes;Yes;2001;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/818773f9a4aab608b6fd11c807d21dc9b51e4dfc

PIT is not yet an effective clinical reality due in part to early loss of functional islet mass. In addition, current immunosuppressive drugs have toxic effects on islets and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. Precise and durable α‐ and β‐cell function is essential for the success of PIT. Therefore, it is important to establish whether PIT can produce adequate long‐term metabolic control, especially in the absence of chronic immunosuppressive therapy (CIT). In the present study, the stability of functional α‐ and β‐cell mass and metabolic function was assessed in streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced diabetic primates following PIT in the absence of CIT. Diabetes was induced in rhesus macaques with STZ, 140 mg/kg. Hyperglycemia was reversed rapidly by PIT coupled with a 14‐day tolerance induction protocol based on F(Ab)2‐IT and DSG (n = 7). Two diabetic animals received the tolerance induction protocol without PIT. Acute rejection was presented in three animals at 70, 353 and 353 days post transplant in the tolerance induction protocol, whereas the controls [F(Ab)2‐IT or DSG alone] showed early 10‐day function but all lost islet function by days 15–70. One recipient [F(Ab)2‐IT or DSG] died euglycemic after a surgical procedure on day 187. At 2 years, three animals studied had a normal FIM evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test, mixed meal test, acute insulin response to glucose, glucose disposal rate, and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp. PIT in STZ‐induced diabetic primates resulted in restoration of normal α‐ and β‐cell function. Operational tolerance induction was achieved with only peritransplant administration of F(Ab)2‐IT and DSG sparing the animals from chronic exposure of diabetogenic immunosuppressive drugs. These results offer an exciting new potential for treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42330d3a87f71d8ec9f4c3a172f6f46b4ae9fcae

A data storage scheme utilizing fog computing architecture allows a user to share cloud data with other users via the assistance of fog nodes. In particular, a fog node obtaining a re-encryption key of the data owner is able to convert a cloud ciphertext into the one which is decryptable by another designated user. In such a scheme, a proxy should not learn any information about the plaintext during the transmission and re-encryption processes. In 2020, an ID-based data storage scheme utilizing anonymous key generation in fog computing was proposed by some researchers. Although their protocol is provably secure in a proof model of random oracles, we will point out that there are some security flaws inherited in their protocol. On the basis of their work, we further present an improved variant, which not only eliminates their security weaknesses, but also preserves the functionalities of anonymous key generation and user revocation mechanism. Additionally, under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption, we demonstrate that our enhanced construction is also provably secure in the security notion of IND-PrID-CPA.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3931e8c488a253092b617685d337e919a9dafc3

FK506 and rapamycin (RAPA), on the other hand, have structural similarities, but act by different mechanisms to yield immunosuppression. Besides their immunosuppressive action, CsA and FK506 are known to interfere with T-cell development. CsA treatment after lethal X-irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation results in autoimmune disease, which is referred to as CsA-induced autoimmunity. In this study, we examined the effect of RAPA on T-cell development by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry in female Lewis and Brown Norway rats. Irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation were performed before a 4-week course of RAPA administration to determine de novo T-cell development in relation to possible autoimmune phenomena. RAPA interfered with the maturation of thymocytes to the CD4+CD8+ DP stage, which resulted in a relative increase in TCRalphabeta(-) immature thymocytes, localized in a rim along the outer cortex. The thymus of RAPA-treated animals had a thinner cortex, leading to stronger thymic atrophy. In the periphery, only a few T cells were observed at the end of RAPA treatment. In the Lewis rat, a normal CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio and an increased Th1/Th2 ratio was observed within the T-cell population. Six weeks after cessation of RAPA therapy, the T-cell compartment was restored to normal, with respect to number and phenotype. In Brown Norway rats, however, T-cell areas were barely detectable at the end of RAPA treatment. The CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was decreased as a result of a lower number of CD4 T cells; the Th1/Th2 ratio was increased but Th2 remained higher. Similar to Lewis rats, the situation was almost normalized 6 weeks after cessation of RAPA administration. However, Brown Norway rats, in contrast to Lewis rats, showed T-cell infiltration and concomitant induction of MHC class II in the submandibular salivary gland, as well as insulitis, in the pancreas.

Signs of hepatitis with elevated transaminase activities in plasma, severe infiltration of the liver by neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, and necrotic areas were observed in control mice treated intraperitoneally with PBS 24 h and 1 h before Con A challenge. T cell‐ and macrophage‐derived cytokines (IL‐2, interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ), tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α), IL‐1β, IL‐6) were released with different kinetics in the circulation of these mice. SF, 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg, administered 24 h and 1 h before Con A challenge, protected the mice against the hepatitic effects of Con A. The protective effects of SF were dose‐dependent and accompanied by profound modifications of blood levels of cytokines induced by Con A, so that, relative to control mice, SF (80 mg/kg)‐treated animals showed markedly diminished plasma levels of IL‐2, IFN‐γ and TNF‐α, along with augmented levels of IL‐6. These results suggest that SF might be useful in the treatment of immunoinflammatory liver diseases in humans.;Yes;Yes;1997;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/678e48559a810dca8c74bfcef188a052e46a9c8d

Check well away.;Poster;Development of human antimouse antibody (HAMA) is a major limiting factor in the application of murine mAb for clinical use. A novel immunomodulatory drug, deoxyspergualin (DSG), has shown potential to suppress antimouse antibody response in preclinical model systems. We conducted a Phase I trial to determine the effect of DSG on HAMA response to murine mAb L6 administered to patients with advanced cancers (in previous trials, this antibody elicited HAMA in two-thirds of the treated patients). L6 mAb was administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg/m2 on days 1-5. DSG was administered at doses of 50 mg/m2 [dose level (dl) 1] or 150 mg/m2 (dls II and III) on days 1-7. Treatment courses were repeated every 6 weeks (dls I and II) or every 3 weeks (dl III). HAMAs were quantitated by a commercially available ELISA assay (ImmuSTRIP; anti-isotypic antibodies) and a radiometric assay (antiisotypic and anti-idiotypic antibodies). Pharmacokinetics of L6 and DSG was also studied in all consenting patients. Among 24 evaluable patients, 2 patients developed detectable HAMAs using the ELISA (one each at dls I and II) after a median follow-up of 122 days (P = 0.0001 as compared to historical controls). Even in the two patients who developed HAMA, the HAMA levels were quite low (160 and 181 ng/ml; historical experience, 70-38,744 ng/ml). The radiometric assay detected anti-L6 antibodies in 13 patients (4, 6, and 3 at dls I-III, respectively) after a median of 82 days. The median highest anti-L6 antibody level was 129 ng/ml (range, 21-2150). The highest anti-L6 antibody level at dl III was only 44 ng/ml. The results suggest suppression of anti-idiotypic response also. No clinical antitumor activity was observed, and no significant changes in T4/T8 subsets or immunoglobulins occurred (suggesting a lack of generalized immunosuppression). We conclude that DSG can suppress HAMA response to L6. A starting dose of 150 mg/m2/day is recommended for Phase II trials to confirm this observation.;Yes;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d435cfbeb74d7b8fdfbe9875e4df487f27c9e3c3

Have close garden down.;Poster;Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is rapidly inactivated by exposure to a naturally occurring antimicrobial system consisting of peroxidase, H2O2, and a halide. Among the potential sources of H2O2 is the amine oxidase system in which mono-, di-, and polyamines are oxidatively deaminated with the formation of H2O2. The polyamine spermine is present at exceptionally high concentrations in semen. We report here that spermine, spermidine, and, to a lesser degree, the synthetic polyamine 15-deoxyspergualin are viricidal to HIV-1 when combined with amine oxidase and myeloperoxidase. Antiviral activity required each component of the spermine-amine oxidase-peroxidase system and was inhibited by azide (a peroxidase inhibitor) and by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase. Heat treatment of catalase largely abolished its inhibitory effect. These findings implicate H2O2 formed by the amine oxidase system in the antiviral effect and raise the possibility that the polyamine-amine oxidase-peroxidase system influences the survival of HIV-1 in semen and in the vaginal canal.;Yes;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c895b7c4bf989f19d58eabc348e2ffccb2cd4d81

We have studied the generation of lymphocytes in mice treated with this drug. The differentiation of T cells in the thymus was blocked at an important early control point: the CD4-8- --> CD4+8+ transition, known to depend on the expression of a preTCR complex that includes the variable TCR-beta, but not TCR-alpha, chain. In clear contrast, a later control point, the CD4+8+ --> CD4+8- or CD4-8+ transition, dependent on the display of a conventional alpha:beta TCR complex, appeared unaffected, as did activation of mature T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, preB cell differentiation in the bone marrow was blocked at a precisely equivalent point: the A-C --> C' transition, controlled by expression of a pre-receptor complex containing the Ig heavy, but not light, chain. Mature B cells seemed unperturbed. These findings have theoretical implications, suggesting common signaling pathways in early lymphocytes that are distinct from those employed by more mature cells, and are also of practical interest, to be considered in the design of DSG treatment protocols.;No;Yes;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bf41d82063a1ed6437f64006f4486567610ce96

Manage we that year.;Poster;Proxy re-encryption (PRE) schemes, which nicely solve the problem of delegating decryption rights, enable a semi-trusted proxy to transform a ciphertext encrypted under one key into a ciphertext of the same message under another arbitrary key. For a long time, the semantic security of PREs is quite similar to that of public key encryption (PKE) schemes. Cohen first pointed out the insufficiency of the security under chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) of PREs in PKC 2019, and proposed a strictly stronger security notion, named security under honest re-encryption attacks (HRA), of PREs. Surprisingly, a few PREs satisfy the stronger HRA security and almost all of them are paring-based till now. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first detailed construction of HRA secure single-hop PREs based on standard LWE problems with comparably small and polynomially-bounded parameters in this paper. Combing known reductions, the HRA security of our PREs could also be guaranteed by the worst-case basic lattice problems (e.g. SIVPγ). Meanwhile, our single-hop PRE schemes are also key-private, which means that the implicit identities of a re-encryption key will not be revealed even in the case of a proxy colluding with some corrupted users. Some discussions about key-privacy of multi-hop PREs are also proposed, which indicates that several constructions of multi-hop PREs do not satisfy their key-privacy definitions.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e6ebd829386037d869ecd9c71149e2773b0d6ee

Rich reveal face sure medical close doctor. Director easy future life.;FullPaper;Organ transplantation is limited by the number of cadaveric human donor organs that become available. Xenotransplantation--the transplantation of organs and tissues between animal species--would supply an unlimited number of organs and offer many other advantages. The pig has been identified as the most suitable donor animal. Pig organs, when transplanted into humans or nonhuman primates, are, however, rejected hyperacutely within minutes by antibody-mediated complement activation. Human anti-pig antibodies have been identified as being directed against Gal alpha1-3galactose epitopes on pig vascular endothelium. Major efforts are being made to overcome this hyperacute rejection. Methods being investigated include (i) depletion or inhibition of recipient antibodies or complement, (ii) development of transgenic pigs that do not express the alphaGal epitope and/or express a human complement inhibiting protein (e.g. DAF), and (iii) development of immunological tolerance to pig organs in the recipient. If complement activation is prevented, e.g. by inhibition of complement activation by cobra venom factor, soluble complement receptor 1 or by the use of hDAF transgenic pig organs, then "delayed xenograft rejection" occurs and is again believed to be largely antibody-dependent. Experimental pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation is now, however, resulting in transplant function for days and weeks rather than minutes, and there is therefore optimism that we are on the threshold of a new era in the field of the transplantation of vital organs.;Yes;No;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0918dd48ee1031fb01fadf79fb1fef6d9e8f7ab7

Hear develop whom however. Necessary teacher opportunity wife thousand.;FullPaper;An examination of the mechanisms by which four new immunosuppressive drugs—rapamycin, mizoribine, mycophenolate mofetil, and 15‐deoxyspergualin—exert their effects reveals three major categories. Rapamycin binds to an intracellular immunophilin. The resulting drug‐immunophilin complex inhibits the action of cytokines, thus blocking the activation and proliferation of T cells. Mizoribine and mycophenolate mofetil are antimetabolites that inhibit a key enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. As a result, the proliferation of T cells and B cells is inhibited selectively compared with that of nonlymphoid cells because the salvage pathway is unavailable to lymphocytes. Finally, 15‐deoxyspergualin has a unique mechanism of action, which includes suppressive effects on macrophage function, the induction of cytolytic T cells, B‐cell reactivity, and antibody responses. The demonstrated synergism among certain immunosuppressants allows reduction in the dose of each agent to minimize the individual toxicities. As more of these new agents become available, it is likely that azathioprine will be replaced, and it may be possible to eliminate the need for long‐term maintenance steroid therapy.;Yes;Yes;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b41f3fd585e80b65f00dce3afc03c1804dab3f00

The use of signcryption with aggregation and certificateless authentication reduces the time consumption, overhead and complexity. The solution is also able to solve the key staling problems.

Of I fast case.;DemoPaper;As an essential part to intelligently fine-grained scheduling, planning and maintenance in smart grid and energy internet, short-term load forecasting makes great progress recently owing to the big data collected from smart meters and the leap forward in machine learning technologies. However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumers’ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumers’ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy. Finally, through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we validate our proposed privacy-preserving framework in terms of privacy protection, and computation and communication efficiency.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12393a8e6e7c750eae30c0c538663fa7b426f304

Attorney really imagine top story work rich.;ShortPaper;Local immunosuppression is based on the rationale that one can simultaneously prevent rejection and reduce systemic side effects by administering appropriately chosen immunosuppressive agents directly into the allograft. We utilized a mongrel canine renal transplant model with a programmable, implantable pump/catheter system to estimate the first-pass extraction of 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG) during renal artery infusion and to compare the efficacy and toxicity of continuous intraarterial (ia) versus intravenous (iv) DSG delivery. Six autotransplanted dogs were given DSG by both iv bolus (1 mg/kg) and ia infusion (1.0 mg/kg/d). DSG was administered to allograft recipients by continuous ia infusion at 0.5 (n = 11) and 0.75 (n = 8) mg/kg/day and by continuous iv infusion at 0.5 (n = 12) and 0.75 (n = 6) mg/kg/day. Mean +/- SD elimination half-life was 0.6 +/- 0.1 hr, and the transplanted kidney removed as much as 55-88% (mean 66%) of locally infused DSG. When compared with untreated controls [mean survival time (MST) = 8 days], low-dose (0. 5 mg/kg/day) DSG produced a significant antirejection effect when given ia (MST = 12 days; P = 0.04) but not iv (MST = 9 days; P = 0. 09), with equivalent overall mean drug levels during normal renal function. However, two of the four longest-surviving animals in the ia group died from severe systemic toxicity, manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, and sepsis. High-dose (0.75 mg/kg/day) DSG significantly prolonged survival via both local (MST = 12 days; P = 0.04) and systemic (MST = 11 days; P = 0.02) routes, but half of the iv-treated dogs died from, and four of the longer-surviving ia-treated animals manifested signs of, systemic toxicity, with significantly higher mean drug levels in the iv group. DSG significantly suppressed vascular rejection at both doses when administered locally and systemically, dose-dependently affected the severity of tubulointerstitial rejection and graft edema, and was not nephrotoxic. Our autotransplant pharmacokinetic data overestimated the allografted kidney's ability to extract DSG during local infusion of slightly lower, but immunosuppressive, doses, so that death from systemic toxicity was not prevented and a direct survival benefit of ia vs iv therapy was not realized. Local DSG administration might be combined with other immunosuppressants to therapeutic advantage.;No;Yes;1997;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c115cc59dd3d92f8c9c8bdd3710a37e492d3ac3

The new revolution of technology will also bring new challenges to data security, particularly data confidentiality. As a promising encryption method for supporting fine-grained access control, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is widely given attention by the academia and industry. However, most existing schemes suffer from the efficiency problem limiting its deployment for the cloud-assisted smart grid, especially for resource-limited users. To address this problem, this paper proposes two efficient pairing-free ciphertext-policy attribute-based schemes that eliminate the computation-intensive bilinear pairing operation. The basic scheme only uses some simple scalar multiplications based on elliptic curves, and the enhanced scheme provides an important usability feature, namely the users and attributes revocation. The security of the proposed schemes is reduced to the elliptic curve decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. Finally, the performance analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed schemes are suitable for the cloud-assisted smart grid.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fee9b461774250c148e89ef272e90c77a310e1bb

One of the latest techniques is the use of the Memristor as an encryption element. In this paper, it has been introduced a two-column array inductor for Memristor-Based Wireless Power Transfer (M-WPT) systems. The traditional WPT circuits are based on switches, which do require a control circuit for timing and have low data encryption factor. By adopting the memristive Chua‘s circuit with the chaotic behaviour characteristic, it is possible to create a symmetrical dual-key cryptography. Furthermore, in this innovative solution, the high inductance value of the traditional Chua circuit can be further reduced by using the dynamic effects of the coils flux linkage. The simulation results exhibit the dual-scroll attractors phase portrait, which is available for encryption features. Therefore, the data collected from the phase portrait are used as true random number generator in Python code. Instead of using algorithms, the code can create a symmetrical key for an unique chaotic cryptography. In order to build a prototype, it has been created a PCB design for the whole system. The experiment highlights the unpredictable voltage and current and validates the chaotic behaviour of the transmitter and receiver.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed6a75c253d4c89bed8d13347c0a86d3d6b3724c

By offering the capability to connect and integrate both digital and physical entities, IoT becomes an important paradigm that enables a whole new class of applications and services. Security is one of the most challenging issues that need to be addressed before these IoT applications and services can be fully embraced. In this survey, we investigate the major research efforts over the period of 2013–2019 that address IoT security and privacy issues. We provide extensive discussions on securing cloud-based IoT solutions. The main focus of these discussions is on securing the information in transit between IoT devices and IoT applications, where most of the data processing and modelling tasks take place. These discussions include all security aspects and challenges facing the data in transit. Specifically, a number of common attacks that target IoT solutions are first discussed, while presenting the main challenges of IoT security (e.g., the resource limitation of IoT devices, which hinder the ability of such devices to do expensive computations for securing the data). Then we present the main security requirements needed by IoT systems, which include access control, integrity, and authentication. We review recent research work in providing security and privacy services, which delegate the expensive computations to an edge or cloud, to cope with the low computations restrictions in IoT devices. Open research issues and possible research directions in securing cloud-based IoT systems are discussed, while proposing some possible solutions.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1547045692119acfab1dd98a9fce9b5e0607bbcd

Suggest age relate rule.;FullPaper;Although cyclosporin A is a highly effective treatment for several skin disorders, particularly psoriasis, its use in dermatology appears limited due to drug-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Newer, similar-acting anti-T-cell agents such as FK-506 and rapamycin may be more effective; therefore a comparison was made with cyclosporin A to assess their inhibitory action on T-cell responses and keratinocyte proliferation. Using a guinea-pig model of delayed-type hypersensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), drugs were given systemically (25 mg/kg cyclosporin A, rapamycin; 2.5 mg/kg FK-506) and topically (0.02% and 2%) at the time of DNFB challenge or several hours after and were assessed with respect to erythema and the numbers of infiltrating T lymphocytes entering skin-challenge sites. FK-506, at all concentrations, significantly inhibited both T-cell infiltration and skin reddening when used by both routes. Rapamycin displayed no inhibitory effect, whereas cyclosporin A only suppressed the erythema response when given systemically. The inhibition of normal human keratinocyte growth by the drugs was assessed using a protein dye-binding assay. After 2 weeks, FK-506 had no effect, whereas cyclosporin A and rapamycin both inhibited keratinocyte growth in a dose-dependent fashion and almost equivalently in serum-containing and serum-free keratinocyte growth medium. The findings showed that in vivo only FK-506 suppressed T-cell involvement in sensitized animals. In contrast, it failed to have any effect on keratinocyte growth, whereas rapamycin was more potent than cyclosporin A in inhibiting their proliferation. The future benefit of these drugs in dermatology may ultimately lie in their combined use.;Yes;Yes;1994;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3396d4042b06a80acbeb52fe156f2b8359cd78b5

For EAT induction, the mice were immunized with 100 μg of porcine thyroglobulin (p Tg) emulsified in CFA on day 0 and in IFA, for boosting, on day 14. Twenty‐eight days after primary immunization, histological and serological signs of EAT occurred in control mice treated with PBS which showed marked lymphoid infiltration of the thyroid glands along with increased serum titres of anti‐pTg antibodies. Development of both these EAT features was significantly suppressed when the mice were treated with 2.5 mg/kg body weight DSP, given daily, five times a week, from day —2 to day + 28 after immunization. The effect appeared to be dose‐dependent and DSP was ineffective when given under the same experimental conditions at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight. No DSP‐toxic effects could be observed during the experiment. These results provide further evidence for the powerful immunosuppressive properties of DSP and suggest that this drug may be used in the treatment of autoimmune thyroid diseases and other T‐cell mediated autoimmune disorders in humans.;Yes;Yes;1994;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/263f59330a8ba5b361c1093bb5f4626ed3f5d8d1

Prior to the CY challenge (350 mg/kg body weight), female euglycemic NOD mice were randomly divided into three groups (A–C). Groups B and C were treated daily from 1 day before to 13 days after the CY challenge with sIL‐1R at doses of 0.2 and 2 mg/kg body weight. Group A was treated with PBS. By 2 weeks after CY administration, an acute form of autoimmune diabetes with glycosuria, hyperglycemia and severe insulitis occurred in the majority (13/20, 65%) of the control mice (group A). In contrast, repeated injections with sIL‐1R protected NOD mice from insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) development in a dose‐dependent fashion; the incidence of IDDM was 53.3% (8/15) in the mice treated with 0.2 mg/kg and only 6.7% (1/15) in those treated with 2 mg/kg. However, none of the doses of the sIL‐1R reduced the extent of insulitis in NOD mice. Importantly, the anti‐diabetogenic property of sIL‐1R may not involve major T cell function impairment; accordingly, in parallel experiments, splenic lymphoid cells from NOD mice not challenged with CY, but treated with 2 mg/kg sIL‐1R for 5 consecutive days showed a normal distribution of mononuclear cell subsets and maintained their capacity to secrete interferon‐γ and IL‐2 and to proliferate in response to polyclonal mitogenic stimulation with concanavalin A.;No;Yes;1994;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/830130f7df5592bc209cf4f24c5f3b4d4dbbcd2a

Show bank at fish task several.;DemoPaper;Cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent inhibitor of T-cell activation, has been shown to have several effects on thymocyte maturation, thymic stromal cells, and the generation of autoreactive T cells. In Lewis rats, the combination of lethal irradiation, syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, and a 4-week course of CsA administration causes the development of an autoimmune disease (CsA-AI) resembling allogeneic graft-versus-host disease. This occurs upon withdrawal of CsA, provided the thymus receives irradiation and is present during CsA treatment. In this study, the separate effects of irradiation or CsA treatment on thymic stromal cells and thymocytes, compared to the combinatory effects, were examined using immunohistochemistry and tricolor flow cytometric analysis. CsA treatment causes an involution of the thymic medulla and a strong reduction of the cell number of thymocytes and stromal cells residing in the medulla. However, within the remaining medullary area, changes in cell distribution and antigen density on these cells were not observed. Irradiation on the other hand causes a strong depletion of thymocytes. The thymocyte population is recovered within 2 weeks and a cortical and medullary region can be distinguished. CsA treatment in combination with irradiation results in a strongly inhibited recovery of the medulla during CsA treatment, whereas the cortex recovers to normal size and morphology. The presence of the medullary IDC and epithelial cells is reduced proportionally to the small size of the medulla. However, the distribution of these stromal cells is normal. During the CsA administration, the thymuses from irradiated and CsA-treated rats are very similar to thymuses from CsA-treated rats. In conclusion, no changes specific for irradiation plus CsA treatment have been observed. Regarding the distribution and size of medullary stromal cells and residing thymocytes, thymuses from irradiated and CsA-treated rats hardly differ from the thymuses from rats treated only with CsA. Therefore, irradiation seems essential in the generation of CsA-AI by eliminating suppressor-cell circuits in the periphery.;No;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc49e1590d16b6e18e34ba5a6d3c43f725eb2e0a

The NOD mouse model has clinical and histoimmunological features similar to those of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The SEB- and LPS-treated BALB/c mouse models exhibit pathogenic similarities with human septic shock conditions. In the NOD mouse, fusidin suppressed the spontaneous development of insulitis (mean inhibition 73%) and hyperglycaemia (IDDM incidence 25% versus 0%) when administered at 40 mg/kg five times weekly for 8 consecutive weeks from the fourth week of age; concurrently treated animals exhibited reduced percentages of splenic T lymphocytes. This anti-diabetogenic effect was confirmed in the accelerated model of diabetes induced in the NOD mouse with cyclophosphamide (CY) (IDDM incidence 55% versus 21-6% using dosages of fusidin from 40 to 80 mg/kg five times weekly); protection from IDDM development was achieved even when the drug (80 mg/kg/day) was first administered 7 days after CY challenge. In contrast, fusidin did not reverse hyperglycaemia when administered to CY-treated animals within 3 days of IDDM development. In the two models of septic shock, prophylactic treatment with fusidin, 80 mg/kg given three times for 2 days prior to D-Gal/SEB or D-Gal/LPS challenge, drastically reduced the lethality compared with D-Gal/buffer-treated mice. This effect may depend on the inhibitory action of fusidin on the secretion of cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, the serum levels of which were greatly diminished in the fusidin-treated mice (mean inhibition 50-90%). These results demonstrate that fusidin may have a role in the treatment of cell-mediated autoimmune diseases and cytokine-mediated infectious diseases in humans.;Yes;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b2bcfaee0540cdee512a98706d84ae8acbbfa55

Providing a cyber-security framework for the IIoT offers a thorough comprehension of the whole spectrum of securing interconnected industries, from the edge to the cloud. Several signcryption schemes based on either identity-based or certificateless configurations are available in the literature to address the IIoT’s security concerns. Due to the identity-based/certificateless nature of the available signcryption schemes, however, issues such as key escrow and partial private key distribution occur. To address these difficulties, we propose a Certificate-Based Signcryption (CBS) solution for IIoT in this article. Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptosystem (HECC), a light-weight version of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), was employed to construct the proposed scheme, which offers security and cost-efficiency. The HECC utilizes 80-bit keys with fewer parameters than the ECC and Bilinear Pairing (BP). The comparison of performance in terms of computation and communication costs reveals that the proposed scheme provides robust security with minimal communication and communication costs. Moreover, we used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) to assess the security toughness, and the results show that the proposed scheme is secure.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/018e933015320e427d83d8caaa3fa45980b9f21b

Therefore, we apply a number of optimization methods to minimize the size of the stored data and/or the cycle count for the computation of the algorithms.

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) on a device represent a low cost primitive exploiting the unique random patterns in the device and have been already applied in a multitude of applications for secure key generation and key agreement in order to avoid an attacker to take over the identity of a tampered device, whose key material has been extracted. This paper shows that the key agreement scheme of a recently proposed PUF based protocol, presented by Chatterjee et al., for Internet of Things (IoT) is vulnerable for man-in-the-middle, impersonation, and replay attacks in the Yao–Dolev security model. We propose an alternative scheme, which is able to solve these issues and can provide in addition a more efficient key agreement and subsequently a communication phase between two IoT devices connected to the same authentication server. The scheme also offers identity based authentication and repudiation, when only using elliptic curve multiplications and additions, instead of the compute intensive pairing operations.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28971f54716b08a8f6674ee2b6789e74fd23ad5e

Both signcryption schemes (providing digital signatures and encryption simultaneously) and digital signatures rely on computation-intensive public-key cryptography. When the number of signatures or encrypted messages the device needs to generate after deployment is limited, a trade-off can be made between performing the entire computation on the embedded device or moving part of the computation to a precomputation phase. The latter results in the storage of the precomputed values in the memory of the processor. We examine this trade-off on a health sensor platform and we additionally apply storage encryption, resulting in five implementation variants of the considered schemes.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33a2b50b4d4b52a52c922c98537ba143afef21b5

In order to make the delegation process more secure and authentic, we proposed a secure and efficient identity-based proxy signcryption in cloud data sharing (SE-IDPSC-CS), which provides a secure privilege delegation mechanism for a person to delegate his/her signcryption privilege to his/her proxy agent. Our scheme allows the manager of the company to delegate his/her signcryption privilege to his/her proxy agent and the proxy agent can act as a manager and generate signcrypted messages on his/her behalf using special information called ”proxy key”. Then, the proxy agent uploads the signcrypted ciphertext to a cloud service provider (CSP) which can only be downloaded, decrypted and verified by an authorized user at any time from any place through the Internet.

If CsA and DSP acted synergistically in vivo, their combined use would allow using each compound at lower doses than those required when each drug is given in monotherapy. Consequently, dose‐dependent side effects could be reduced and the therapeutic activity maintained or even enforced. Toward this end we studied the effects of combined treatment with CsA and DSP on the course of IDDM in the diabetes‐prone (DP)‐BB rat. The results show that two ‘low’ doses of CsA (2mg/kg) and DSP (1mg/kg) that are clinically ineffective in suppressing IDDM development in BB rats when administered alone under a prolonged prophylactic regimen (30–105 days old), may successfully prevent, but not cure, the disease when given contemporaneously under the same experimental conditions. The combined treatment was well tolerated, and no side effects were noticed. These data suggest that the combined use of CsA and DSP may deserve consideration for its possible application in the prevention/treatment of human IDDM and other autoimmune diseases.;Yes;Yes;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6557c60cb86f1dee1c51870b9c9c8b30007dacb

As a novel cutting-edge technology, the IoT enables a plethora of smart-devices equipped with diverse computing, sensing, and actuation capabilities to be connected to the Internet. Thus, it promises to provide a revolutionary and fully connected “smart” world while greatly developing economies and enhancing the quality of life. IoT is indeed an emergent global phenomenon, where real-time remote access to data and applications opens new unprecedented opportunities for ubiquitous monitoring and managing. In such dynamic, interconnected, and heterogeneous environment where the context conditions (location, time, situation sensitivity, etc.) are continuously and frequently changing, context-aware and adaptive solutions for data access are required to respond to the applications’ needs. Nevertheless, until now, no schemes provide concrete context-aware access control mechanisms in IoT. In this article, we design a novel context-aware attribute-based access control (CAABAC) that considers the dynamic context changes. The proposed approach incorporates the contextual information with the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to guarantee adaptive contextual access to data. The extensive analysis and simulations prove both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Specifically, context-aware and adaptive remote access is enabled while outperforming other benchmarked schemes in terms of storage, communication, and computational cost.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ccefb527873d0072c8176a733e324255b9b3dd88

Mobile devices are usually cloned in the cloud to minimize computation cost and energy consumption. Moreover, these mobile and cloud interactions lead to online and offline switching in easy and continuous ways in order to edit shared multimedia documents. However, the main concern of these applications is still maintaining consistent and secure copies of the shared documents with low latency and high local responsiveness. Indeed, appropriate access control models are needed to preserve the features of collaborative editing applications when combining mobile and cloud environments. In this paper, we present a study on existing cloud-based collaborative editors and the current state of the art of access control models used in the collaborative edition context.

In this paper, we combine CLPS with cyclic multiplication groups (CMGs) to construct a new certificateless proxy signcryption scheme from CMGs (CMGs-CLPSS). CMGs-CLPSS will receive significant attention because it simplifies the traditional public key cryptosystem (PKC) and solves the key escrow issue suffered by identity-based public key cryptosystem (IB-PKC). In CMGs-CLPSS, an encrypted message can only be decrypted by a designated receiver who is also responsible for verifying the message; moreover, if a later dispute over repudiation occurs, the designated receiver can readily announce ordinary CLPS for public verification without any extra computation effort. CMGs-CLPSS is proved to have the indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2 security) and existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen-message attacks (UF-CMA security) in the random oracle model. CMGs-CLPSS outperforms the existing schemes on the basis of computational complexity and is suitable for applications in digital contract signing and online proxy auction, and so on.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fb79ae9a2db1e250954647d7f877c6be90eeda8

As per recent estimates, the number of IoT devices will surpass 50 billion by 2020. Unsurprisingly, this mushrooming of IoT devices has drawn the attention of attackers who seek to exploit them for their own benefit, with the Mirai botnet being perhaps the most prominent example of IoT specific malware [1, 2]. Basically, IoT brings along a plethora of potential security and privacy risks to the end-users, including the unsanctioned access and abuse of private information, the enabling and strengthening of assaults against other systems, and the breeding of risks pertaining to personal safeness [3]. Especially, IoT facilitates the creation of an assortment of privacy risks to the consumer associated with the collection of personal and sensitive information, like their preferences, locations, habits, and so on. In the midor long-run these pieces of data can be used to, say, profile or impersonate the user or group of interest. On the other hand, such risks to security, privacy, and trust may significantly diminish end-user’s confidence in IoT and therefore impede its full realization.

Being part of the modern vaccine formulations, these compounds have contributed remarkably to the field of therapeutics. Despite the successful record maintained by these agents, the requirement of novel immunomodulators keeps increasing due to the increasing severity of diseases. Hence, research regarding the same holds great importance. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of immunomodulators in improving performance of various vaccines used for counteracting most threatening infectious diseases, mechanisms behind their action and criteria for development of novel immunomodulators. Expert opinion: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying immune response is a prerequisite for development of effective therapeutics as these are often exploited by pathogens for their own propagation. Keeping this in mind, the present research in the field of immunotherapy focuses on developing immunomodulators that would not only enhance the protection against pathogen, but also generate a long-term memory response. With the introduction of advanced formulations including combination of different kinds of immunomodulators, one can expect tremendous success in near future.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09067241699436e829b9c05425ccb37deb184627

In the present study, the effects of feeding Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HN001, DR20), Lactobacillus acidophilus (HN017) and Bifidobacterium lactis (HN019, DR10) on in vivo and in vitro indices of natural and acquired immunity in healthy mice were examined. Mice were fed daily with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis (10(9) colony forming units) and their immune function was assessed on day 10 or day 28. Supplementation with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis resulted in a significant increase in the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leucocytes and peritoneal macrophages compared with the control mice. The proliferative responses of spleen cells to concanavalin A (a T-cell mitogen) and lipopolysaccharide (a B-cell mitogen) were also significantly enhanced in mice given different LAB. Spleen cells from mice given L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis also produced significantly higher amounts of interferon-gamma in response to stimulation with concanavalin A than cells from the control mice. LAB feeding had no significant effect on interleukin-4 production by spleen cells or on the percentages of CD4+, CD8+ and CD40+ cells in the blood. The serum antibody responses to orally and systemically administered antigens were also significantly enhanced by supplementation with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis. Together, these results suggest that supplementation of the diet with L. rhamnosus (HN001), L. acidophilus (HN017) or B. lactis (HN019) is able to enhance several indices of natural and acquired immunity in healthy mice.;Yes;No;2000;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a40d300f07d3ea03de74033f413d8e6bbda832b0

When used alone, vaccination with 100 or 500 μg of 3-1E resulted in significantly decreased oocyst shedding compared with that in nonvaccinated chickens. Simultaneous vaccination of the 3-1E protein with the IL-1, -15, -16, or -17 gene induced higher serum antibody responses than 3-1E alone. To evaluate protective intestinal immunity, vaccinated birds were challenged with live E. acervulina oocysts 14 days posthatch, and fecal-oocyst shedding and body weight gain were determined as parameters of coccidiosis. Chickens vaccinated with 3-1E protein showed significantly lower oocyst shedding and normal body weight gain than nonvaccinated and infected controls. Simultaneous immunization with 3-1E and the IL-2, -15, -17, or -18 or IFN-γ gene further reduced oocyst shedding compared with that achieved with 3-1E alone. These results provide the first evidence that in ovo vaccination with the recombinant 3-1E Eimeria protein induces protective intestinal immunity against coccidiosis, and this effect was enhanced by coadministration of genes encoding immunity-related cytokines.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8361bc66c9ab03c975e2b1ab44d00a0e63c5edd

Vaccination efficacy was assessed by increased serum anti–3-1E antibody titers, reduced fecal oocyst shedding, and enhanced body weight gain following experimental infection with E. acervulina. When used alone, anti–3-1E antibody titers were transiently, but reproducibly, increased at 2 wk and 3 wk posthatching in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, significantly reduced oocyst shedding and increased weight gain were observed at relatively high-dose 3-1E vaccinations (≥25 μg/egg). Combined immunization with the 3-1E and IL-1, IL-2, IL-15, or IFN-γ genes induced higher serum antibody responses compared with immunization with 3-1E alone. Following parasite infection, chickens hatched from embryos given the 3-1E gene plus the IL-2 or IL-15 genes displayed significantly reduced oocyst shedding compared with those given 3-1E alone, while 3-1E plus IL-15 or IFN-γ significantly increased weight gain compared with administration of 3-1E alone. Taken together, these results indicate that in ovo immunization with a recombinant Eimeria gene in conjunction with cytokine adjuvants stimulates protective intestinal immunity against coccidiosis.;Yes;Yes;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7dc4d30f1ba575163e909acedd0cad51bb974af7

The microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi causes disseminated infection in immunosuppressed patients with HIV, cancer, or transplants and in the elderly. In vivo and in vitro studies on the effectiveness of drugs are controversial. Currently, there is no effective treatment. We tested albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, metronidazole, and cyclosporine in mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and inoculated by the intraperitoneal route with 107 E. cuniculi spores. One week after experimental inoculation, the mice were treated with albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, metronidazole, and cyclosporine. Histological and morphometric analyses were performed to compare the treated groups. The state of immunosuppression was evaluated by phenotyping CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Nontreated mice showed acute disseminated and fatal encephalitozoonosis. The treatment with benzimidazoles significantly reduced infection until 30 days posttreatment (p.t.), but at 60 days p.t., the infection had recurred. Metronidazole decreased infection by a short time, and cyclosporine was not effective. All animals were immunosuppressed by all the experiments, as demonstrated by the low number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We conclude that no drug was effective against E. cuniculi, but the benzimidazoles controlled the infection transiently.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24dafd9aa4a385ed6298dbc64a3d91eb8ead3d34

Want understand although control prepare important. Mouth new notice moment under dream task.;Poster;With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a lot of sensitive information in our daily lives are now digitalized and open to remote access. The provision of security and privacy of such data would incur comprehensive cryptographic services and has raised wide concern. Hybrid signcryption schemes could achieve various kinds of cryptographic services (e.g., confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity) with much lower cost than the combination of separate traditional cryptographic schemes with each providing a single cryptographic service. Thus, hybrid signcryption schemes are very suitable for IoT environments where resources are generally very constrained (e.g., lightweight sensors and mobile phones). To ensure that the overall hybrid signcryption scheme provides adequate cryptographic service (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, and authentication), its parts of KEM (key encryption mechanism) and DEM (data encryption mechanism) must satisfy some security requirements. Chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security has been widely accepted as the golden standard requirement for general encryption schemes. However, CCA security appears too strong in some conditions. Accordingly, Canetti et al. (CRYPTO 2003) proposed the notion of replayable CCA security (RCCA) for encryption schemes, which is a strictly weaker security notion than CCA security and naturally more efficient. This new security notion has proved to be sufficient for most existing applications of CCA security, e.g., encrypted password authentication. This is particularly promising for IoT environments, where security is demanding, yet resources are constrained. In this paper, we examine the RCCA security of the well-known SKEM+DEM style hybrid signcryption scheme by Dent at ISC 2005. Meanwhile, we also examine the RCCA security of the Tag-SKEM+DEM style hybrid signcryption scheme by Bjorstad and Dent at PKC 2006. We rigorously prove that a hybrid signcryption scheme can achieve RCCA security if both its SKEM part and its DEM part satisfy some security assumptions.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/140f0c407f4cf474ccea5a7002b3f19d7fb87a99

In such a heterogeneous scenario, security provisioning becomes necessary, hence novel security solutions must be designed to handle the highly distributed fog-to-cloud nature. In the security area, key distribution and authentication are referred to as two critical pillars for a successful security deployment. Unfortunately, traditional centralized key distribution and authentication approaches do not meet the particularities brought by a Fog-to-cloud system due to its distributed nature. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed key management and authentication (DKMA) strategy to make Fog-to-cloud systems as secure as possible. The paper ends up presenting some results assessing the benefits of the proposed strategy in terms of traffic and delay reduction.;Yes;No;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/657bf2bcecaaa1bb38a393cfca2b226039fd0da3

Next pick road cause memory last.;DemoPaper;Recently Liang et al. propose an interesting privacy-preserving ciphertext multi-sharing control for big data storage mechanism, which is based on the cryptographic primitive of anonymous multi-hop identity based conditional proxy re-encryption scheme AMH-IBCPRE. They propose a concrete AMH-IBCPRE scheme and conclude their scheme can achieve IND-sCon-sID-CCA secure (indistinguishable secure under selectively conditional selectively identity chosen ciphertext attack). However, our research show their scheme can not be IND-sConsID- CCA secure for single-hop and multi-hop data sharing. Also in 2014, Liang et al. propose an interesting deterministic finite automata-based functional proxy reencryption scheme DFA-based FPRE for secure public cloud data sharing, they also conclude their scheme can achieve IND-CCA secure (indistinguishable secure under chosen ciphertext attack), we also show their scheme can not be IND-CCA secure either. For these two proposals, the main reason of insecurity is that part of the re-encryption key has the same structure as the valid ciphertext, thus the adversary can query on the decryption oracle with this part of the re-encryption key to get secret keys, which will break the CCA-security of their scheme.We give an improved AMH-IBCPRE scheme and an improved DFA-based FPRE scheme for cloud data sharing and show the new schemes can resist our attack and be CCA-secure.We also demonstrate our improved AMH-IBCPRE scheme’s efficiency compared with other related identity based proxy re-encryption schemes, the results show our scheme is almost the most efficient one.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/baf09e4556afad697d7eff9f2032a64cd4413179

Cyclosporin A, FK-506, and Rapamycin cause minimal or no inhibition of corneal epithelial cells proliferation in concentrations of up to 500 ng/ml. At concentrations of 5000 ng/ml, all drugs induce an inhibitory effect. In this system, Rapamycin induces the strongest inhibition in most cases. Nonetheless, a residual activity of more than 50% is recorded even at the highest concentrations. On the lymphocytes, both FK-506 and Rapamycin show marked inhibitory effects at 0.5 ng/ml, while CsA shows significant inhibition only at the level of 50 ng/ml or higher.

This paper describes serial observations on the clinical course of a typical patient with subacute thyroiditis. This patient showed specific features of destructive thyrotoxicosis with increases in the serum levels of acute phase reactants and in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. She also showed signs of liver dysfunction [slightly increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP), and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)], slight anemia, glucose intolerance, increased pancreatic enzymes, splenomegaly, and an increase in peripheral Leu 7 positive (NK/K) cells. These abnormalities all improved with recovery from disease. These findings indicate that in this patient with subacute thyroiditis inflammation is not limited to the thyroid gland but also involves the liver, pancreas and spleen.

Who relationship take stop.;Poster;When thyrotoxic patients are first seen in an outpatient clinic, it is important to make a differential diagnosis of Graves' disease (GD) and painless thyroiditis (PT). Using the three parameters of total T3/T4 ratio, TSH and T-ALP activity, all of which can be obtained within one hour in our hospital, 173 untreated patients with thyrotoxicosis were evaluated for the ratio of each parameter. For GD vs. PT, total T3/T4 (ng/microg) ratio (>20), TSH (<0.005 microU/ml) and elevated T-ALP had a likelihood ratio of 2.14, 2.12 and 4.07, respectively. When a patient had all three positive parameters, the likelihood ratio increased to 5.81, which showed effective synergy. These data suggest that, in addition to total T3/T4 ratio and TSH value, T-ALP activity is a useful parameter for the rapid differentiation of GD. The lower T-ALP activity seen in PT is probably due to the fact that patients develop less severe thyrotoxicosis or visit hospital earlier than patients with GD. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy for Graves' disease might be increased by using the three parameters in combination.;Yes;Yes;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b7f8ded85d0976ca727554ce8116162fc343fc2

All relays are considered as EH nodes that harvest energy from renewable and radio frequency (RF) sources, then use it to forward the information to the destinations. The power-splitting (PS) protocol, by which the EH node splits the input RF signal into two components for information transmission and energy harvesting, is adopted in the relay side. The objective is to optimize the PS ratios and the relays' transmit power levels in order to maximize the total sum-rate utility over multiple coherent time slots. An optimization approach based on geometric programming is proposed to solve the problem. Numerical results illustrate the behavior of the EH-based two-way multiple-relay system with respect to various parameters and compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of the dual problem-based approach.;No;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21c3ebd396fe9379dbac15e7a76698693fc854e7

Free treatment though smile. Song per team.;Poster;SUMMARY Cyclosporin A (CsA) acts as a powerful immunosuppressant through its binding to the cytosolic isomerase, cyclophilin (CyP), forming a complex which inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. The drug is also selectively anti-parasitic but its mode of action remains unknown. The mouse tapeworm, Hymenolepis microstoma is sensitive to CsA, but the rat tapeworm, H. diminuta is not susceptible either in rats, mice or in vitro. Using these two tapeworm models, the uptake and binding of CsA were examined in relation to parasite cyclophilins. Uptake and compartmentalization of the drug were markedly different in the two species: H. microstoma takes up more drug than does H. diminuta and sequesters more drug into intracellular compartments. Characterization of cyclophilins using both CsA binding and isomerase activity assays reveals that H. microstoma possesses two cyclophilin isoforms (Mr 17700 and 21400) with isomerase activity that is inhibited by CsA. Using identical assays, we have been unable to demonstrate CsA-binding proteins or CsA-sensitive isomerase activity in H. diminuta. These data suggest that the anthelmintic action of CsA relates in some way to the presence and function of parasite cyclophilins.;Yes;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8221a7ba9a8d7f0fae027f0572b87b81b2b1e51

Methods: A chart review of 78 patients (78 eyes) undergoing primary enucleation or a secondary procedure using autogenous sclera as a wrapping material from March 1997 to October 2004 was undertaken. Primary enucleation was performed in 54 eyes and secondary implantation in 24. In severely constricted eyes or eviscerated eyes with small implants, the sclera was unfolded and used for wrapping only on the anterior surface of the implant. Results: The average size of implants was 19.7 mm in diameter, and all the 78 implants were over 18 mm. During an average postoperative follow-up of 18 months, complications such as implant exposure, infection or extrusion did not occur in any case.

Methods: Medical records of the patients who underwent primary placement of hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye) or porous polyethylene (Medpor) orbital implants after enucleation between 2002 and 2005 in Farabi Eye Hospital were reviewed, and the occurrence of implant exposure during follow-up visits was recorded. The exclusion criteria were secondary implantation, evisceration, or follow up of less than 1 year unless the exposure had occurred in the year after surgery. In the hydroxyapatite group, the implants were wrapped either in Mersilene mesh (65%) or in donor sclera (35%). Wrapping was not performed for any patient in the porous polyethylene group. Results: A total of 198 cases with hydroxyapatite and 53 cases with porous polyethylene implant were identified. The most common causes of enucleation in both groups were globe trauma and painful blind eye. Rate of exposure was significantly higher [odds ratio (OR) = 7.97, p < 0.001] in patients with porous polyethylene (34.0%) than in those with hydroxyapatite implant (6.1%). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. Mean time of exposure after surgery was significantly (p < 0.001) longer in patients with porous polyethylene implant. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted a significantly (p < 0.001) higher rate of exposure in patients with porous polyethylene implant during the follow-up time. Conclusion: Unwrapped porous polyethylene implants demonstrated a higher rate of exposure, and longer time interval to exposure, compared with wrapped hydroxyapatite implants.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/710aeafed644c8f87dd93b51063f399fe052c8ec

Fragestellung Es soll eine Übersicht über den aktuellen Stand der augenprothetischen Versorgung in Deutschland erstellt werden. Dabei wird auf die neuesten klinischen Erkenntnisse, die Handhabung der Augenprothesen sowie auf typische Komplikationen und psychologische Fragestellungen, mit denen Augenärzte im Alltag konfrontiert werden, eingegangen. Methoden Der Beitrag bietet eigene klinische Ergebnisse und eine aktuelle Literaturübersicht aus PubMed. Ergebnisse Enukleierte Patienten werden in Deutschland meist mit doppelwandigen, hohlen Prothesen aus Kryolithglas versorgt, Patienten mit einem Mikrophthalmus oder einem phthitischen Auge dagegen mit einer einwandigen, dünnen Bulbusschale. Patienten, die Augenprothesen aus Kryolithglas tragen, scheinen sowohl mit ihrem Aussehen als auch mit der Optik der Prothese zufriedener zu sein als PMMA-Augenprothesenträger (PMMA: Polymethylmethacrylat). Glasprothesen müssen mindestens jährlich erneuert, Kunststoffprothesen einmal pro Jahr poliert und alle 5 Jahre ersetzt werden. Bei Kindern, insbesondere in Wachstumsphasen, sollte mindestens halbjährlich die Passform der Prothese kontrolliert werden. Eine leicht höhere Bruchgefahr der Augenprothesen aus Kryolithglas stellt im Alltag für die meisten Patienten keinen größeren Nachteil dar. Okularisten und Ophthalmologen sollten zusammen mit dem Patienten ein individuelles Reinigungsprozedere festlegen, das sowohl vom Prothesenmaterial als auch von äußeren Faktoren abhängt. Komplikationen wie die allergische, die gigantopapilläre, die virale und die bakterielle Konjunktivitis oder auch die Blepharoconjunctivitis sicca müssen frühzeitig erkannt und therapiert werden, um die Prothesenfähigkeit zu erhalten. Bei entzündungsbedingtem Schrumpfungen des Bindehautsackes oder beim Post-Enukleations-Socket-Syndrom muss die Prothesenfähigkeit chirurgisch wiederhergestellt werden. Da die Gesundheit des verbliebenen, sehenden Auges die größte psychologische Belastung von Augenprothesenträgern darstellt, ist eine gute augenärztliche Betreuung, Für- und Vorsorge nach der Exstirpation eines Auges essenziell. Schlussfolgerungen Eine reibungslose augenprothetische Versorgung, eine adäquate und frühzeitige Therapie möglicher Komplikationen sowie die Berücksichtigung psychologischer Aspekte sind maßgeblich, um Patienten nach dem Verlust eines Auges dauerhaft erfolgreich zu rehabilitieren.;Yes;No;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7050522b84117b608f9b21d52ef62b137ba664cd

Play animal Mrs southern.;Poster;It is occasionally essential to surgically remove the damaged eye of the patient in the case of serious oculoorbital injuries, intraocular cancers, and other life-threatening diseases. An orbital implant is placed into the anophthalmic socket after the eye is removed to provide adequate volume reinstatement and revamp the cosmetic look of a normal eye. In the previous few decades, implant design and material selection criteria have progressed from basic nonporous polymeric spheres to devices with more complicated shapes and functions to ensure improved long-term clinical results. Because of their highly interconnected porous design, ceramic and polymeric porous implants have found popularity as a passive framework for fibrovascular ingrowth, with lower obstacle rates and the option of setting to improve prosthetic eye mobility. These materials, however, are not without flaws. The danger of migration and extrusion, infections after surgery, and poor motility transferred to the cosmetic ocular prosthesis are important elements of orbital implants of today. As a result, the development of novel biomaterials with improved functionalities (i.e., antibacterial effect, angiogenesis, and in situ moldability) that allow better eye replacement is more desirable than ever, highlighting one of the most challenging aspects of research topics in the field of ocular implants. This study highlights the history of orbital implants.

The outcome of drug administration in vivo varies with timing of treatment relative to infection, route of administration, dose and number of treatments applied. CsA is clearly antiparasitic against malaria, schistosomes, adult tapeworms, metacestodes and filarial nematodes. By contrast, it acts as an immunomodulator against trypanosomes and Giardia, by exacerbating infection; in the case ofLeishmania spp. the drug acts variously. In some other infections CsA acts both as an antiparasite drug and as an immunosuppressant (Toxoplasma, avian coccidiosis and gastrointestinal nematodes).;Yes;Yes;1992;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7aba706f3f8285e635a3f33d1de55883d7ee78a7

Debate else part but.;Poster;In this paper, we propose a joint power allocation, time switching (TS) factor and relay selection scheme for an energy harvesting two-way relaying communication network (TWRN), where two transceivers exchange information with the help of a wireless-powered relay. By exploiting the TS architecture at the relay node, the relay node needs to use additional time slots for energy transmission, reducing the transmission rate. Thus, we propose a joint resource allocation algorithm to maximize the max-min bidirectional instantaneous information rate. To solve the original non-convex optimization problem, the objective function is decomposed into three sub-problems and solved sequentially. The closed-form solution of the transmit power of two sources and the optimal TS factor can be obtained by the information rate balancing technology and the proposed time allocation scheme, respectively. At last, the optimal relay node can be obtained. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the traditional schemes and power-splitting (PS) scheme.;No;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9663fb6fbeca66d100b8f36fff8c04e6bb876df0

We propose the optimal relay selection scheme to save energy and prolong network lifetime. To avoid decoding error propagation, a decoding set is constructed, which consists of the relays that can successfully decode the source signal through adjusting their power splitting ratios. Due to the insufficient energy or deep fading, some of the relays in decoding set may fail to deliver the source signal to destination. By excluding these relays from the decoding set, we further construct a forwarding set, from which one best relay is then selected to forward the information-bearing signal, while all the unselected relays keep on harvesting energy for future use. The relay selection criterion is the maximal remaining energy of the relays, so as to prolong network lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides longer lifetime as compared to the conventional ones.;No;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67da2ddb03a267bf399c7e6e885f902efd6ebbae

Considering the minimum EH activation constraint and quality of service (QoS) requirement, energy efficiency is maximized by jointly optimizing the resource division ratio and transmission power. To cope with the non-convexity of the optimizations, we propose the low complexity iterative algorithm based on fractional programming and alternative search method (FAS). The key idea of the proposed algorithm first transforms the objective function into the parameterized polynomial subtractive form. Then we decompose the optimization into two convex sub-problems, which can be solved by conventional convex programming.

Remember there mind environment agency ago.;Poster;BACKGROUND, White spots can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brace attachments. Fluoride is effective at reducing decay in susceptible individuals and is routinely prescribed in various different forms to patients during orthodontic treatment., , , OBJECTIVES, To evaluate the effectiveness of fluoride in preventing white spots during orthodontic treatment and to compare the different modes of delivery of fluoride., , , SEARCH STRATEGY, We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 August 2002); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002); MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 1980 to week July 2003). Authors of trials were contacted for further data., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: a randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trial, involving the use of a fluoride-containing product compared with no use or use of a non-fluoride control and enamel demineralisation was assessed during or after orthodontic treatment., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, Six reviewers independently, in duplicate, extracted data. The primary outcome was the difference in the presence or absence of white spots between experimental and control patients for parallel design studies, and between experimental and control quadrants, for split-mouth design studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken for the items assessed for quality and publication bias., , , MAIN RESULTS, The primary outcome of the review was the presence or absence of white spots by patient at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included any quantitative assessment of enamel mineral loss or lesion depth. Other outcomes such as differences in size and severity of white spots, any patient based outcomes, such as perception of white spots could not be included because there were insufficient data. Fifteen trials, with 723 participants, provided data for this review. None of the studies fulfilled all of the methodological quality assessment criteria. There is some evidence that a daily sodium fluoride mouthrinse reduces the severity of enamel decay surrounding a fixed brace (weighted mean difference for lesion depth -70.0; 95% CI -118.2 to -21.8) and that use of a glass ionomer cement for bracket bonding reduces the prevalence (Peto OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84) and severity of white spots (weighted mean difference for mineral loss -645 vol%.microm; 95% CI -915 to -375) compared with composite resins., , , REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS, There is some evidence that the use of topical fluoride or fluoride-containing bonding materials during orthodontic treatment reduces the occurrence and severity of white spot lesions, however there is little evidence as to which method or combination of methods to deliver the fluoride is the most effective. Based on current best practice in other areas of dentistry, for which there is evidence, we recommend that patients with fixed braces rinse daily with a 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthrinse. More high quality, clinical research is required into the different modes of delivering fluoride to the orthodontic patient.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c7c6b0f446a6d69c794528fe3482a6b5449d64f

Give late senior together natural.;DemoPaper;AIM, The aim of the current research was to evaluate the efficacy of different fluoride-releasing bonding products in preventing enamel demineralization around orthodontic brackets by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM)., , , MATERIALS AND METHODS, This research was performed using 80 healthy human premolar teeth that were extracted in course of orthodontic therapy. Until use, the sample premolars were subjected to storage in 0.1% thymol. Each premolar was thereafter cleansed with pumice for 10 seconds. Stainless steel brackets for premolars were employed. The 80 samples were allocated at random to one of the four groups (20 in each) as follows: Group I, control; group II, Transbond Plus color change adhesive; group III, GC Fuji Ortho LC; and group IV, Vitremer. An hour following bonding, all samples were subjected to pH cycling at a temperature of 37°C for a 14-day period. The premolar teeth were assessed below SEM. Analysis was performed with the one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at a p-value less than 0.05., , , RESULTS, The extreme area of demineralization was abridged by the use of Transbond™ Plus color change adhesive (108.19 ± 0.68), trailed by GC Fuji Ortho LC (119.24 ± 0.37) use, Vitremer (121.56 ± 0.92) as well as the control group (141.88 ± 1.09) in that order. And there was a statistically significant difference found between the groups (p <0.001). Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) was employed in an overall comparison of mean areas of enamel demineralization, which depicted that differences were significant statistically with the exception of group III and group IV., , , CONCLUSION, The current research came to a conclusion that the Transbond Plus color change adhesive group was more potent in significant inhibition of demineralization areas in comparison to GC Fuji Ortho LC group and Vitremer group., , , CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE, In course of fixed orthodontic therapy, demineralization of enamel is an inherent occurrence. Multiple approaches are being continually developed to avoid the formation of white spot lesions (WSLs) that compromise esthetics and cause deprived remineralization that enhances the menace of dental caries. Bonding agents that can release fluorides are thus considered highly efficacious.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e14dd7979e381202e071d6e68b706af90baca32b

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate if the infiltration technique is the most efficient treatment to resolve a white spot lesion when compared with remineralization and microabrasion techniques. The Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome question investigated: “in enamel WS lesion, the infiltration treatment compared to remineralization or microabrasion treatments is more or less effective in the camouflage effect?” The research was performed on electronic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and web of science. The search was conducted up to April 1, 2020. The scientific search engines produced 324 results. Only 14 were screened after screening. Based on the articles analyzed in this systematic review, the resin infiltration technique seems to be the most effective and predictable treatment for the aesthetic resolution of WSLs.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71bcb1231cf69c80f3719135cd7933378accc48d

Fast understand very meet.;Poster;AIM, This literature review aims to update the evidence for prevention of white spot lesion (WSL) using orthodontic sealants among patients with fixed orthodontic appliances., , , BACKGROUND, As a major issue among orthodontists, prolonged treatment duration increases the risk of plaque development around orthodontic brackets and bands. In consequence, this can lead to heightened risk for caries development and higher possibility of WSL development around fixed orthodontic brackets., , , RESULTS, Increased prevalence of WSLs generally occurs during orthodontic treatment. This review explored various products of orthodontic sealants used to prevent WSL. Orthodontic sealants do not require patient compliance and thus will further lessen the burden among orthodontists as well as support enamel surface for a long period of time during treatment. Certain factors, however, are considered important in the efficacy of these sealants, such as antibacterial activity, color stability, resistance to acid and brush abrasion, and their effect on shear bond strength (SBS)., , , CONCLUSION, The review showed that the use of orthodontic sealants in preventing WSLs during and after fixed orthodontic treatment is significantly effective. However, the bioactive glass is deemed more effective against WSL development due to its ability to immediately repair enamel surface, low cytotoxicity, and high biocompatibility. Moreover, clinical studies on bioactive glass are still needed to determine its acceptability among patients with fixed orthodontic appliance., , , CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE, Development of WSL around the orthodontic brackets during treatment is a difficult task among orthodontists. As such, this review explored various strategies to effectively combat WSL development for good oral health and esthetics during orthodontic treatment.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa52b1ade8ed1b1a354674314a4deb650dcafef8

The color of 22 white spot lesions and the sound adjacent enamel (SAE) were assessed with a spectrophotometer at T0 (baseline), T1 (after treatment), and T2 (1 year after). The color change ΔE (WSLs-SAE) at T0 vs. T1 were compared to evaluate the camouflage effect efficiency, and at T1 vs. T2 to assess the stability of outcomes. To evaluate the effect on the treatment outcome of gender, the presence or not of previous orthodontic treatment, WSLs onset more/less than 10 years, the age of the patient, and the ΔE WSL (T0 vs. T1) was analyzed. The difference between ΔE (WSLs-SAE) at T0 and T1 resulted in statistical significance (p < 0.01). No statistical difference was found between ΔE (WSLs-SAE) at T1 vs. T2. The variables considered showed no statistical differences in treatment outcomes. The results of our investigation show that the technique used is immediately effective and the camouflage effect keeps up and steady one year after treatment.

Evidence age thing all standard.;DemoPaper;Background White spot lesions (WSLs) are a common complication after orthodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the antimicrobial properties of selenium-containing vs. fluoride-containing orthodontic materials. Material/Methods Antibacterial efficacy of orthodontic materials (SeLECT Defense bonding agent, Adhesive agent, Band Cement, Transbond Plus SEP bonding agent, Transbond Plus Adhesive agent, Fuji I Band cement, Fuji Ortho LC Adhesive agent, Ortho Solo Bonding agent, Transbond XT bonding agent, and Transbond XT primer) was tested with the inhibition of 2 bacterial strains: S. mutans (ATCC 10449) and L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356). The antimicrobial efficacy of the materials was measured by agar diffusion test. The diameters of inhibition zones around each disk were measured in millimeters (mm). Results Materials containing selenium and fluoride showed significant differences from the negative control (both p<0.001). Orthodontic materials containing fluoride as a potential antimicrobial agent showed larger zones of inhibition in total (9.1±2.6 mm), the selenium group was the second-most effective (4.7±4.9 mm), and the group without any potential antimicrobial agent showed the least antimicrobial effect (0.9±1.0 mm). Materials from the group with no antibacterial agent were not significantly different from the negative control group (p>0.05). Conclusions Materials containing selenium carried the most significance when comparing microorganisms with the agent, since they were the only ones showing difference between the 2 microorganisms. They showed statistically significant difference in efficacy against S. mutans, and poor antimicrobial effect against L. acidophilus. These data suggest that orthodontic materials containing selenium might have the potential to prevent WSLs due to their antimicrobial properties.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdfac336ed3cf604042bd6958960c1a6bd09a785

Successful mind both at social would.;ShortPaper;BACKGROUND, Early dental decay or demineralised lesions (DLs, also known as white spot lesions) can appear on teeth during fixed orthodontic (brace) treatment. Fluoride reduces decay in susceptible individuals, including orthodontic patients. This review compared various forms of topical fluoride to prevent the development of DLs during orthodontic treatment. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2013., , , OBJECTIVES, The primary objective was to evaluate whether topical fluoride reduces the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs after fixed appliances. The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of topical fluoride delivery in reducing the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs, as well as the severity of lesions, in terms of number, size and colour. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DLs, and oral health-related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects., , , SEARCH METHODS, Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 1 February 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 1 February 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 1 February 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 1 February 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, Parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus a placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. Cochrane's statistical guidelines were followed., , , MAIN RESULTS, This update includes 10 studies and contains data from nine studies, comparing eight interventions, involving 1798 randomised participants (1580 analysed). One report contained insufficient information and the authors have been contacted. We assessed two studies as at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk of bias, and two at high risk of bias. Two placebo (non-fluoride) controlled studies, at low risk of bias, investigated the professional application of varnish (7700 or 10,000 parts per million (ppm) fluoride (F)), every six weeks and found insufficient evidence of a difference regarding its effectiveness in preventing new DLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.93; 405 participants; low-certainty evidence). One placebo (non-fluoride) controlled study, at unclear risk of bias, provides a low level of certainty that fluoride foam (12,300 ppm F), professionally applied every two months, may reduce the incidence of new DLs (12% versus 49%) after fixed orthodontic treatment (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; 95 participants). One study, at unclear risk of bias, also provides a low level of certainty that use of a high-concentration fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) by patients may reduce the incidence of new DLs (18% versus 27%) compared with a conventional fluoride toothpaste (1450 ppm F) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00; 380 participants). There was no evidence for a difference in the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs on the teeth after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances for the following comparisons: - an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination versus a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse, - an amine fluoride gel versus a non-fluoride placebo applied by participants at home once a week and by professional application every three months, - resin-modified glass ionomer cement versus light-cured composite resin for bonding orthodontic brackets, - a 250 ppm F mouthrinse versus 0 ppm F placebo mouthrinse, - the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The last two comparisons involved studies that were assessed at high risk of bias, because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, although the internal validity and hence the quality of the studies has improved since the first version of the review, they have compared different interventions; therefore, the findings are only considered to provide low level of certainty, because none has been replicated by follow-up studies, in different settings, to confirm external validity. A patient-reported outcome, such as concern about the aesthetics of any DLs, was still not included as an outcome in any study. Reports of adverse effects from topical fluoride applications were rare and unlikely to be significant. One study involving fluoride-containing glass beads reported numerous breakages., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, This review found a low level of certainty that 12,300 ppm F foam applied by a professional every 6 to 8 weeks throughout fixed orthodontic treatment, might be effective in reducing the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs. In addition, there is a low level of certainty that the patient use of a high fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) throughout orthodontic treatment, might be more effective than a conventional fluoride toothpaste. These two comparisons were based on single studies. There was insufficient evidence of a difference regarding the professional application of fluoride varnish (7700 or 10,000 ppm F). Further adequately powered, randomised controlled trials are required to increase the certainty of these findings and to determine the best means of preventing DLs in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. The most accurate means of assessing adherence with the use of fluoride products by patients and any possible adverse effects also need to be considered. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DLs on patient satisfaction with treatment.;Yes;No;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7eff9fc8b2afedc5ca44543582610827996d1066

Management yeah red cover ago.;DemoPaper;Background Development of white spot lesions around orthodontic fixed orthodontic appliances is a common finding, especially in patients with poor oral hygiene. One of the conservative interventions for regression of these lesions is using chemical solutions. The current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of fluoride and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) on microhardness improvement of affected enamel. Material and Methods Forty-five intact human incisor teeth were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups of 15. Fluoride group, ACP group and artificial saliva group (control group). Inducing of white spot lesion was done by PH-cycling model. Samples of the first and second group were submerged into 0.05% fluoride and 0.05% ACP solutions respectively for one minute a day. The rest of the time, all specimens were put in artificial saliva, which was incubated in 37 °c temperature. Microhardness of specimens was assessed by Vickers microhardness test in three stages: 1: Baseline microhardness assessment that was done before induction of white spot lesion, 2: Secondary microhardness assessment that was done after induction, 3: Final microhardness assessment that was done after chemical treatment. The SPSS 11.5 software was used for statistical analysis and p< 0.05 was considered as significant. Results Microhardness of specimens in the fluoride and ACP groups had significantly improved after the treatment (between secondary assessment and final assessment). In the control group, no significant improvements were observed. In final assessment, there were significant differences between the ACP and control groups, but no significant differences were found neither between the fluoride and ACP, nor the Fluoride and control groups. Conclusions According to the current study, both 0.05% ACP and 0.05% fluoride solutions enhanced enamel micro-hardness in treatment of white spot lesion.

Methods In total, 125 bracket-bonded bovine incisor enamel blocks with artificial WSLs were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups (home bleaching, home bleaching + fluoridation, in-office bleaching, and in-office bleaching + fluoridation). A spectroradiometer (SR) and digital images (DIs) were used to evaluate colorimetric parameters (Commission Internationale l'Eclairage L*a*b*) for all specimens. Color measurements were obtained before WSL formation (T1), after WSL formation (T2), and after completion of the external tooth bleaching treatment (T3). Results The SR-based color change after bleaching was significantly greater in the treatment groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). SR-based lightness (L*) and red-green (a*) values were significantly higher at T2 than at T1 (p < 0.001), with no significant changes in yellow-blue (b*) values. At T3, SR-based L* values had increased while a* and b* values had decreased in the treatment groups (p < 0.001). The DI-based color difference between the sound enamel and WSL areas (ΔE*DI) increased significantly from T1 to T2 in all groups (p < 0.001) and significantly decreased from T2 to T3 in the treatment groups (p < 0.001). No significant differences in ΔE*DI at T3 were shown between the four treatment groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions The findings of this study suggested that external tooth bleaching with fluoridation can alleviate the conspicuity of WSLs.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/708c5c51393aaa4aca176aec8b1ff3640472d2f1

Although there have been reports regarding VEO-IBD in Western countries, those in Asia are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features of Japanese VEO-IBD patients. Methods Patients with VEO-IBD diagnosed between 2006 and 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. The disease phenotypes were classified into ulcerative colitis type (UC-type) and Crohn’s disease type (CD-type), and the clinical features and courses were compared between the phenotypes. Results Overall, 54 VEO-IBD patients (19 patients with UC-type and 35 patients with CD-type) were evaluated. The median age at onset was 18 months. One patient had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and 9 patients had monogenic IBD. Monogenic IBD was more prevalent in the CD-type patients with perianal disease (CD-type (PD)). The age at onset was significantly lower in the CD-type group (P<0.05). The most common initial symptom was bloody stools (70%), followed by diarrhea (63%), weight loss (24%), fever (20%), and perianal disease (20%). Excluding patients with SCID and monogenic IBD, 23 out of 44 patients (52%) required biologics. The biologics were switched in 11 out of 44 patients (25%), and the majority of these patients (82%) were in the CD-type group. Overall, 9 patients (20%) required intestinal resection or ostomy placement. Conclusions CD-type tends to occur at an earlier age, and monogenic IBD occurs significantly more frequently in CD-type (PD). Disease severity and treatment should be individualized, owing to the disease heterogeneity.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/519cd10484561f1959478d6ed11c83a5a5e10c1e

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 0.05% amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), 0.5% ACP, and 0.05% fluoride solutions, as well as artificial saliva on the color improvement of white spot lesions (WSLs). In this in vitro study, 50 human premolar teeth were randomly classified into five groups. At baseline, all the samples were assessed by using a colorimeter (E0). Then, white spot lesions were induced on the surface of the teeth by means of a pH-cycling model, and the colorimeter was used again (E1). Afterwards, samples of the 1st and 2nd groups were kept in 0.05% ACP and 0.5% ACP solutions for 1 min/day, respectively. The 3rd group specimens were placed in 0.05% fluoride solution for 1 min/day. The other two groups were kept in artificial saliva and distilled in water separately. All the samples were assessed by the colorimeter for a third time (E2). We found no significant difference between the groups in ∆E1. There was also no significant difference among 0.05% ACP solution, 0.5% ACP solution, 0.05% fluoride solution, and artificial saliva considering ∆E2. However, a significant difference was noted between the above-mentioned solutions and distilled water in ∆E2. With respect to ∆E3, there were considerable differences between ACP solution and artificial saliva. The same results were obtained for the difference between fluoride solution and artificial saliva.

Parent turn focus born.;FullPaper;Background: Research on the utilization and effectiveness of antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics in children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) is urgently needed. Here we describe anti-TNF use and durability in a multicenter cohort. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with VEOIBD (<6 years) between 2008 and 2013 at 25 North American centers. We performed chart abstraction at diagnosis and 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. We examined the rate of initiation and durability of infliximab and adalimumab and evaluated associations between treatment durability and the following covariates with multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression: age at diagnosis, sex, disease duration, disease classification, and presence of combined immunomodulatory treatment versus monotherapy. Results: Of 294 children with VEOIBD, 120 initiated treatment with anti-TNF therapy and 101 had follow-up data recorded [50% Crohn disease (CD), 31% ulcerative colitis (UC), and 19% IBD unclassified (IBD-U)]. The cumulative probability of anti-TNF treatment was 15% at 1 year, 30% at 3 years, and 45% at 5 years from diagnosis; 56 (55%) were treated between 0 and 6 years old. Anti-TNF durability was 90% at 1 year, 75% at 3 years, and 55% at 5 years. The most common reason for discontinuation of anti-TNF were loss of response in 24 (57%) children. Children with UC/IBD-U had lower durability than those with CD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06–0.51; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Utilization and durability of anti-TNF in VEOIBD is relatively high and comparable with older children. Having Crohn disease (compared with UC/IBD-U) is associated with greater durability.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4938a8b192b01e58c511872414979036429697e

Bag manager pass why.;Poster;INTRODUCTION: White spot lesions (WSLs) are common adverse effect of orthodontic treatment, which can be prevented and treated by orthodontists. This study was conducted to assess Iranian orthodontists’ practice regarding the prevention and treatment of WSLs in their patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 109 Iranian orthodontists were selected from the Iranian Association of Orthodontists’ directory by cluster sampling. For data collection, a questionnaire was designed and its validity and reliability was confirmed (Cronbach's α =0.85). The questionnaire included eight general questions and eight questions about practice with regard to the prevention and treatment of WSL. Data were analyzed by descriptive tests, ANOVA test, and t-test in SPSS 20 software. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean score of orthodontists’ practice was 7.62 (range: 0–8), and 94.4% of the participants were rated as good, while 3.7% and 1.9% were rated as moderate and weak, respectively. Women's score was significantly higher than that of men (P = 0.001). With increasing participants’ age, their practice has been improved (P = 0.001), but there was no significant relation between years of experience and their practice (P = 0.230). Nearly 94.4% of the orthodontists prescribed fluoride products. Toothpastes and fluoride mouth rinses were the most common prescribed products (34%). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to Iranian orthodontists’ practice, it was fortunate to note that majority of the respondents were taking care of their patients with regarding to the prevention and treatment of WSLs. For enhancing their competencies, it is recommended to plan educational courses which are useful for promoting their knowledge and practice about new products and procedures used for the prevention and treatment of WSLs.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/894c31fe7aab306afe9a075c177c0ea3074beb06

Methods: A population-based retrospective cohort study of all <10-year-olds diagnosed with IBD between 2004 and 2017 in Southwest England was performed. Patients were divided into age groups at diagnosis. Demographics, investigations, and phenotype at diagnosis were collected. Treatments and outcomes were analysed at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up. Poisson regression was used for IBD incidence rate ratios; Wald test for variation by age group; parametric/nonparametric tests for phenotype. Results: There were 666 new paediatric IBD (pIBD) patients ages ≤16 years, from which 136 were 2 to 9 (2–5 years: 32; 6–9 years: 104). Incidence of pIBD increased from 4 to 6 cases per 100,000 whereas in A1a group was stable around 2 cases per 100,000. Crohn Disease (CD) children were majority boys, 2- to 5-year-olds were more likely to have ileal sparing than 6 to 9-year group but had similar rates of surgery and anti-TNF therapy. Two- to 5-year-olds with ulcerative colitis were more likely to have surgery but rates for anti-TNF therapy were similar. Sixteen percent of 2- to 5-year-olds and 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds had IBD-unclassified. No significant differences in symptoms or time to diagnosis were found. Conclusions: Twenty percent of pIBD in Southwest England are 2 to 9 years old. pIBD incidence has increased but is stable in that group. In terms of phenotypic differences, ileal sparing in CD and pancolitis and surgery in UC, are more likely in 2- to 5-year-olds.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0f4b1f7023599cf37bb12334031cca54ed7423d

Banded or bonded teeth exhibit a significantly higher rate of WSLs compared to the controls with no braces as fixed appliances and the bonding materials promote retention of biofilms. These lesions are managed in the first step by establishing good oral hygiene habits and prophylaxis with topical fluorides, including high-fluoride toothpastes, fluoride mouthwashes, gels, varnishes, fluoride-containing bonding materials, and elastic ligatures. Recently, other materials and methods have been recommended, including the application of casein phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphate, antiseptics, probiotics, polyols, sealants, laser, tooth bleaching agents, resin infiltration, and microabrasion.

Although UC presents in children with varying severity, disease extent, and comorbidities, initial treatment is essentially uniform, consisting of 5-aminosalicylate drugs with corticosteroid induction for those with moderately to severely active disease. With the advent of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic therapy and several new biologics and small-molecule drugs for UC, precision medicine approaches to treatment are needed to more rapidly achieve sustained remission, restore quality of life, normalize development, and limit exposure to toxic corticosteroids in children with UC. Here, we review available data on clinical, biochemical, histopathologic, and molecular predictors of treatment response in UC. We also address known predictors and special treatment considerations in specific relevant scenarios such as very-early-onset UC, acute severe UC, ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and UC with concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The review concludes with a prediction of how machine learning will integrate multimodal patient data to bring precision medicine to the bedside of children with UC in the future.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e89c5aaf9d82d6475c3881b5bcb94a1f42596bb

Clinical parameters [Approximal Plaque Index (API), Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI)] as well as levels of salivary mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli (LB) were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Compliance was documented by participants. Appliance wear-times were estimated retrospectively by the patients. All participants received the same brushing instructions and were supplied with the same toothbrush/toothpaste., , , RESULTS, A significant correlation of API values with MS levels (p=0.0003) or with LB levels (p=0.001) was observed. Furthermore, appliance wear-times were significantly associated with API values (p=0.02). The changes of MS or LB levels between beginning and end of the study did not differ significantly between study groups. The changes of the API scores showed slightly different median values (-3.5 in the TG vs. 0 in the CG), the difference, however, was not significant., , , CONCLUSIONS, The results emphasise the need for a careful monitoring of the oral hygiene status in patients with removable orthodontic appliances.

Door staff long suddenly.;Poster;Purpose of review Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a rare presentation defined as onset of intestinal inflammation at the age of <6 years. Some of these young children develop IBD because of inherent defects in immune or epithelial cell function resulting from deleterious mutations in genes involved in mucosal homeostasis. Here, we provide an overview of the clinical, genetic and immunologic approach in patients with VEO-IBD. Recent findings More than 50 different monogenic disorders directly causing IBD have been identified in the last decade; most of them present with unique clinical features in the first years of life. Such a diagnosis may facilitate the administration of targeted therapies and is important for genetic counseling. Nevertheless, a monogenic disorder is identified only in a minority of patients with VEO-IBD. Consequently, different demographic, clinical and histologic features should prompt a detailed genetic and immunologic workup in patients with IBD. Summary A diagnosis of monogenic IBD can have a huge impact on patient's care, enabling in some cases to provide personalized therapies. Clinicians should be aware of unique features of such disorders, and complete a detailed genetic and immune workup in selected cases, even when disease manifests beyond a young age.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf471d0951f5eb9eaaccb2dd262b60470cbc88f7

Material and Methods Information search for controlled studies on humans published between January 2008 and February 2016 was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, The Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were: the English language, study on humans, patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, randomized or quasi-randomized controlled clinical studies fluoride-containing product or casein derivates used throughout the appliance therapy or straightaway after debonding. Results 326 articles were reviewed (Embase 141, PubMed 129, ScienceDirect 41, Cochrane 15). Twelve clinical studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Use of fluoridated toothpaste had a remineralizing effect on white spot lesions (WSLs) (P < 0.05); fluoride varnish and casein supplements were effective in prevention and early treatment of WSLs (P < 0.05). Conclusions Early detection of white spot lesions during orthodontic treatment would allow implementing preventive measures to control the demineralization process before lesions progress. The systemic review has showed that the usage of fluoride and casein supplements in ameliorating white spot lesions during and after fixed orthodontic treatment is significantly effective. However the use of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate can be more beneficial than fluoride rinse in the reduction of demineralization spots.;No;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a39095379a5bd156cbd0b10a590e34a80971af96

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the treatment and progress of early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: This prospective survey evaluated the data of 43 patients aged <8 years who were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the time of diagnosis to 36 months after registration. Results: A total of 12 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), 21 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 with unclassified IBD were enrolled. The mean disease onset age was 3 years and 7 months. Colon and anal lesions were present in 100 and 50% of patients with CD, respectively. Granulomas were detected in 5 patients (41.7%). Dietary elimination including elemental diet was performed in all patients. Eleven patients (91.7%) were in remission by initial induction therapy, and 72.7% maintained remission for 36 months. Three patients (14.3%) with UC had familial history, 71.4% had pancolitis-type UC, and 66.7% exhibited disease of moderate severity. Colectomy was performed in 4 patients (21.1%). Eighteen patients (85.7%) were in remission by initial induction therapy; however, only 15.8% maintained remission for 36 months. Anal complication was more prevalent in infantile-onset IBD than in childhood-onset IBD (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Among Japanese patients aged <8 years who were diagnosed with IBD, colitis-type disease was more common in CD and pancolitis was more common in UC.

These children can present with more extensive and severe disease than older children and adults. The contribution of host genetics in this population is underscored by the young age of onset and the distinct, aggressive phenotype. In fact, monogenic defects, often involving primary immunodeficiency genes, have been identified in children with VEO-IBD and have led to targeted and life-saving therapy. This position paper will discuss the phenotype of VEO-IBD and outline the approach and evaluation for these children and what factors should trigger concern for an underlying immunodeficiency. We will then review the immunological assays and genetic studies that can facilitate the identification of the underlying diagnosis in patients with VEO-IBD and how this evaluation may lead to directed therapies. The position paper will also aid the pediatric gastroenterologist in recognizing when a patient should be referred to a center specializing in the care of these patients.

Many strategies have been developed for preventing WSLs, but great variability exists in preventive measures between orthodontists. This study developed statements on which a clinical practice guideline (CPG) can be developed in order to help orthodontists select preventive measures based on the best available evidence., , , MATERIALS AND METHODS, A nominal group technique (RAND-e modified Delphi procedure) was used. A multidisciplinary expert panel rated 264 practice- and evidence-based statements related to the management of WSLs. To provide panel members with the same knowledge, a total of six articles obtained from a systematic review of the literature were read by the panel in preparation of three consensus rounds. According to the technique, a threshold of 75% of all ratings within any 3-point section of the 9-point scale regarding a specific statement was accepted as consensus., , , RESULTS, After the first and second consensus rounds, consensus was reached on 37.5 and 31.1% of statements, respectively. For the remaining 31.4% of statements, consensus was reached during a 4-h consensus meeting., , , CONCLUSIONS, Statements on the management of WSLs derived from a systematic literature review combined with expert opinion were formally integrated toward consensus through a nominal group technique. These statements formed the basis for developing a CPG on the management of WSLs before and during orthodontic treatment.;No;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89b83cb34ac13a61d9f614f99ea179f32fc6d556

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of hexane and ethanol extracts of Salvadora persica on a monospecies biofilm model established on orthodontic brackets in vitro., , , MATERIALS AND METHODS, Streptococcus mutans biofilm was formed on mini diamond orthodontic brackets following three days of anaerobic incubation at 37˚C. The bacterial cell viability of this biofilm was measured after their exposure to saline, hexane extract of S. persica, ethanol extract of S. persica and 0.2% chlorhexidine using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. On half of the brackets, the colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Both experiments were performed in triplicate., , , RESULTS, The absorbance values obtained from the MTS reduction assay after exposure to the different test agents showed a decline in the bacterial cell viability of the S. mutans biofilm as follows: chlorhexidine (+)<hexane extract (S. persica, 5 mg/ml)<ethanol extract (S. persica, 5 mg/ml)<saline+2% DMSO (-). There was significant difference between saline+2% DMSO and the other test solutions (p<0.05). The mean absorbance values showed that the antimicrobial activity of hexane extract was slightly more effective than that of the ethanol extract and was nearly as effective as chlorhexidine (+). However, the differences in the absorbance values between the extracts of S. persica and chlorhexidine (+) were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The CFU counts of S. mutans obtained from chlorhexidine exposure were lower than from hexane and ethanol extracts., , , CONCLUSION, S. persica extracts were found to have antimicrobial effects on S. mutans biofilm established in vitro on orthodontic brackets suggestive of its potential use as an oral antimicrobial agent for orthodontic patients.;No;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36211c17dcd7971d9df65776867ce67646b4eab7

Quality assessment of the overall body of evidence from meta-analyses was conducted using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group (GRADE) tool., , , RESULTS, One hundred and fifty-seven SRs were identified; meta-analysis was present in 43 of these (27.4 per cent). The highest proportion of SRs that included a meta-analysis was found in Orthodontics and Craniofacial Research (6/13; 46.1 per cent), followed by the CDSR (12/33; 36.4 per cent) and the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics (15/44; 34.1 per cent). Class II treatment was the most commonly addressed topic within SRs in orthodontics (n = 18/157; 11.5 per cent). The number of trials combined to produce a summary estimate was small for most meta-analyses with a median of 4 (range: 2-52). Only 21 per cent (n = 9) of included meta-analyses were considered to have a high/moderate quality of evidence according to GRADE, while the majority were of low or very low quality (n = 34; 79.0 per cent)., , , CONCLUSIONS, Overall, approximately one quarter of orthodontic SRs included quantitative synthesis, with a median of four trials per meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence from the selected orthodontic SRs was predominantly low to very low indicating the relative lack of high quality of evidence from SRs to inform clinical practice guidelines.;Yes;No;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e02a9adbc16caa15fd22d3e60f8c116d69aebcd1

Nutritive acidic assaults were simulated by demineralization cycles 3 times per day for 1 hour with interim storage in artificial saliva. Lesion depths in terms of percentage of fluorescence loss (delta F, delta Q) and lesion extension compared with the baseline were assessed by using quantitative light-induced fluorescence after 2, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days. Etching duration, trial time elapse, and oral hygiene, as well as the significance of factor interactions, were analyzed with 3-way analysis of variance (α=5%)., , , RESULTS, The impact of the factors of enamel brushing, trial time elapse, and etching each had a comparably significant effect on lesion progression. The effect of surplus etching on white spot lesion formation was significantly enhanced by the simultaneous absence of enamel brushing and also the progression of trial time. The combination of 30 seconds of surplus etching with inadequate oral hygiene was especially detrimental., , , CONCLUSIONS, Excessive surplus orthodontic etching of the complete labial enamel surface, instead of the bracket bases only, must be avoided to prevent iatrogenic white spot lesions.

Avoiding complications, surgery and malignancy, alongside minimizing the side effects of medications are vital. However, the reality of treatment involves patients losing response to therapy, or developing complications requiring cessation of medication. The reasons underlying this are numerous and include medication and host-related influences. Underpinning the response to medication, long-term outcomes and loss of response are individual etiological factors including the molecular cause of disease and individual pharmacogenomic influences. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the long-term outcome of IBD, with a focus on pediatric-onset illness and discuss the factors leading to loss of treatment response whilst briefly considering the future of personalized therapy as a strategy to improve long-term outcomes. Expert opinion: Research findings are now moving toward clinical translation, including application of novel medications targeting new pathways. The integration of biological and multiomic data to predict disease outcome will provide personalized therapeutic management.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a78538805a00090188c1635b8913328bc4d4acb3

Significant memory save administration particularly partner part.;Poster;BACKGROUND, Dental caries is a highly prevalent chronic disease which affects the majority of people. It has been postulated that the consumption of xylitol could help to prevent caries. The evidence on the effects of xylitol products is not clear and therefore it is important to summarise the available evidence to determine its effectiveness and safety., , , OBJECTIVES, To assess the effects of different xylitol-containing products for the prevention of dental caries in children and adults., , , SEARCH METHODS, We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 14 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 14 August 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 14 August 2014), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 14 August 2014), Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 14 August 2014), Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 14 August 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of xylitol products on dental caries in children and adults., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where feasible. For continuous outcomes, we used means and standard deviations to obtain the mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the continuous data to calculate prevented fractions (PF) and 95% CIs to summarise the percentage reduction in caries. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. As there were less than four studies included in the meta-analysis, we used a fixed-effect model. We planned to use a random-effects model in the event that there were four or more studies in a meta-analysis., , , MAIN RESULTS, We included 10 studies that analysed a total of 5903 participants. One study was assessed as being at low risk of bias, two were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining seven being at high risk of bias.The main finding of the review was that, over 2.5 to 3 years of use, a fluoride toothpaste containing 10% xylitol may reduce caries by 13% when compared to a fluoride-only toothpaste (PF -0.13, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.08, 4216 children analysed, low-quality evidence).The remaining evidence on children, from small single studies with risk of bias issues and great uncertainty associated with the effect estimates, was insufficient to determine a benefit from xylitol products. One study reported that xylitol syrup (8 g per day) reduced caries by 58% (95% CI 33% to 83%, 94 infants analysed, low quality evidence) when compared to a low-dose xylitol syrup (2.67 g per day) consumed for 1 year.The following results had 95% CIs that were compatible with both a reduction and an increase in caries associated with xylitol: xylitol lozenges versus no treatment in children (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol sucking tablets versus no treatment in infants (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol tablets versus control (sorbitol) tablets in infants (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol wipes versus control wipes in infants (low quality body of evidence).There was only one study investigating the effects of xylitol lozenges, when compared to control lozenges, in adults (low quality body of evidence). The effect estimate had a 95% CI that was compatible with both a reduction and an increase in caries associated with xylitol.Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects from any of the interventions. Two studies reported similar rates of adverse effects between study arms. The remaining studies either mentioned adverse effects but did not report any usable data, or did not mention them at all. Adverse effects include sores in the mouth, cramps, bloating, constipation, flatulence, and loose stool or diarrhoea., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, We found some low quality evidence to suggest that fluoride toothpaste containing xylitol may be more effective than fluoride-only toothpaste for preventing caries in the permanent teeth of children, and that there are no associated adverse-effects from such toothpastes. The effect estimate should be interpreted with caution due to high risk of bias and the fact that it results from two studies that were carried out by the same authors in the same population. The remaining evidence we found is of low to very low quality and is insufficient to determine whether any other xylitol-containing products can prevent caries in infants, older children, or adults.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15aa44b6ecfeea25fe65e688d81920666c138abb

Bar yes clearly set., Visit red administration west box them threat.;Poster;Objectives: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic diseases which negatively affect the schooling of children. The aim is to analyze school absenteeism and its causes in children followed for IBD. Methods: A prospective multicenter study of IBD patients aged from 5 to 18 years old, from September 2016 to June 2017. Data on absenteeism and its causes were collected via a monthly questionnaire completed by patients or their family by mail. The results were compared with existing data supplied by the school authorities (497 students without IBD divided by class). Results: A total of 106 patients (62 boys), median age of 14 (5–18), were included. The global response rate was 83.1%. The patients with IBD were absent an average of 4.8% ± 5.5% of school days during the school year, against 3.2% ± 1.6% for non IBD group (P = 0.034). Digestive disorders accounted for 34% of the causes of absenteeism. Approximately 27% of the absences were due to scheduled events (hospitalizations, endoscopy, or consultations). By excluding the absences for scheduled care, the rate of school absenteeism of patients with IBD is significantly lower than that of non-IBD group. Conclusion: Children with IBD are more frequently absent from school than non-IBD group. The main cause of school absenteeism appears to be associated with the disease itself. The share of scheduled absenteeism is quite large. The organization and scheduling of the patients’ care path must be a priority to maximally limit the negative impact of their disease on the patients’ schooling.;Yes;No;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5b5f061c7d1af07b3feac36908a9b8cba1c6b79

They were recruited into two groups based on the treatment center they attended: governmental group (G; n=45) and private group (P; n=44). Immediately after debonding, the examination of buccal caries and WSLs on premolars and anterior teeth was carried out using the ICDAS-II and the DIAGNOdent Pen. Cross-tabulation was applied to study the correlation between the ICDAS-II index and the DIAGNOdent Pen by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient., , , RESULTS, The G group showed a significantly higher (P<.0001) prevalence of WSLs and/or buccal caries compared to that of the P group based on evaluation by the two methods. Based on ICDAS-II, 43% of the patients in the P group and 9% in the G group were free from any WSLs. In the G group, 22% of the patients had ≥16 LESIONS, whereas there were none for the P group. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the two methods was .71., , , CONCLUSIONS, The prevalence of caries and/or WSLs at debonding was significantly higher in the G group compared to the P group.

More rarely, it can also be caused by volvulus, coagulopathies, necrotizing enterocolitis, polyps, Meckel diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The incidence of IBD is on the rise in children, even affecting infants. The most common subtypes are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While IBD occurrence peaks in the second to third decades of life, paediatric IBD accounts for 7-20% of all cases. Within this age group, the highest rates are seen in the teenage years; however, very early onset IBD can be seen before six years of age. The classic symptoms of CD include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss, while UC is typically associated with bloody diarrhea.

We thus aimed to standardize daily treatment of pediatric UC and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)-unclassified through detailed recommendations and practice points. Methods: These guidelines are a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the Paediatric IBD Porto group of European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). An extensive literature search with subsequent evidence appraisal using robust methodology was performed before 2 face-to-face meetings. All 40 included recommendations and 86 practice points were endorsed by 43 experts in Paediatric IBD with at least an 88% consensus rate. Results: These guidelines discuss how to optimize the use of mesalamine (including topical), systemic and locally active steroids, thiopurines and, for more severe disease, biologics. The use of other emerging therapies and the role of surgery are also covered. Algorithms are provided to aid therapeutic decision-making based on clinical assessment and the Paediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI). Advice on contemporary therapeutic targets incorporating the use of calprotectin and the role of therapeutic drug monitoring are presented, as well as other management considerations around pouchitis, extraintestinal manifestations, nutrition, growth, psychology, and transition. A brief section on disease classification using the PIBD-classes criteria and IBD-unclassified is also part of these guidelines. Conclusions: These guidelines provide a guide to clinicians managing children with UC and IBD-unclassified management to provide modern management strategies while maintaining vigilance around appropriate outcomes and safety issues.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da070c499914291cc1084d21930ee1f1c8bd6736

We aimed to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with IBD during childhood in a population-based cohort according to the Paris classification at diagnosis., , , Methods, The medical records of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients, diagnosed from 2000 to 2016, were reviewed retrospectively. Main outcome measures included time to first flare, hospitalisation, surgery, and biologic therapy., , , Results, In Crohn's disease patients [n = 301, median age 14.2 years], colonic location was associated with higher prevalence of extraintestinal manifestations, whereas ileal location and complicated behaviour were associated with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positivity. During a median follow-up of 9.1 years (interquartile range [IQR]of 4.7-12.3), complicated behaviour at diagnosis was associated with increased risk for surgery (hazard ratio[ HR] = 2.7, p < 0.001] and hospitalisation [HR = 1.5, p = 0.01] but not with the risk for flare or stepping-up to biologic therapy. Isolated colonic disease was associated with a decreased risk of surgery [HR = 0.25, p = 0.02]. During a median follow-up of 8.5 years [interquartile range of 5.1-12], in patients with ulcerative colitis [n = 126, median age 13.7 years], severe disease at diagnosis but not disease extent was associated with the risk for colectomy [HR = 3.5, p = 0.002], hospitalisation [HR = 3.3, p < 0.001], flare [HR = 2.4, p < 0.001] and biologic therapy [HR = 2.6, p = 0.001]., , , Conclusions, The Paris classification for paediatric inflammatory bowel disease has clear predictive properties.

Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study. We reviewed the charts of patients with UC diagnosed between 2 and 18 years at our referral center from January 2007 to January 2016. Laboratory and clinical features at diagnosis, such as disease extent, atypical phenotypes, extraintestinal manifestations, and therapies, and pattern changes during the follow-up, including relapse rate, disease extension, and the cumulative risk for colectomy were collected. Results: One hundred eleven patients were enrolled. Atypical phenotypes were identified at diagnosis in 55 out of 111 patients (49.5%). Extraintestinal manifestations were detected in 16 out of 111 (14.4%) at the diagnosis. During the follow-up 60 out of 111 (54%) patients needed to start azathioprine, 9 out of 111 (8.1%) patients started biologic therapy and 10 out of 111 (patients underwent surgery, resulting in a cumulative risk of 8% at 5 years and 16% at 10 years. Steroid refractoriness (hazard ratio: 13.9) and starting of biologic therapy (hazard ratio: 25.3) represented the best predictors for surgery. The cumulative probability of first relapse was 47% at 6 months and 63% at 1 year. Disease extension was reported in 21 out of 70 patients (30%). Conclusion: Pediatric UC is associated with a severe phenotype and a high percentage of atypical features.

Therefore, health care providers are more frequently encountering very young children with IBD, a chronic and incurable condition requiring life-long therapy. These children are living long lives with IBD and therefore knowledge of long-term outcomes is increasingly important to better counsel families and determine the best course of treatment. This review summarizes the current knowledge and literature surrounding long-term outcomes of pediatric IBD, with emphasis on the following areas: need for surgery due to complicated disease behavior, risk of disease remission and recurrence, mental health and psychosocial well-being, educational outcomes, linear growth impairment, cancer risk, and mortality. In addition, we review recent research about predicting negative long-term outcomes in children with IBD.;No;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce1aaac6e5c88a8a39cbf9862fe414dd106fde75

On the basis of patient information, we describe the clinical presentation and therapy in relation to age at diagnosis in longstanding pediatric IBD. Patients and methods Two surveys were conducted in children and young adults (age: 10–25 years) by pretested postal questionnaires. The main analyses are descriptive, showing proportions and distributions per grouped age of diagnosis. Exploratory logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and disease-related factors associated with prognosis. Recent disease course, use of biological therapy, and resecting surgery were chosen as indicators of disease severity. Patients with a diagnosis in infancy (<2 years of age) are presented as a case series. Results Information of 1280 cases was available [804 Crohn’s disease (CD), 382 ulcerative colitis (UC), 94 IBD not specified] (response: 44.6 and 49.6%). Stable remission during the preceding year was reported by 675 (56.7%) patients; 825 (60.9%) patients reported feeling currenty well. Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was reported by 33% of CD patients and 9.3% of UC patients, immunomodulation in 82.1 and 63.2%, and corticosteroids by 78.4 and 76.1%, respectively (ever use). Age at diagnosis was not associated with indicators of severe disease. Diagnosis in infancy was reported by 37 patients.

In this review, we explore the time to clinical response and remission of current therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as medication, patient and disease related factors that may influence the time to clinical response. It appears that the time to therapeutic response varies depending on the indication for therapy (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis). Agents with the most rapid time to clinical response included corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, exclusive enteral nutrition, aminosalicylates and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy which will work in most patients within the first 2 mo. Vedolizumab, methotrexate and thiopurines had a longer time to clinical response and can take several months to achieve maximal efficacy. Factors affecting the time to clinical response of therapies included use of concomitant therapy, disease duration, smoking status, disease phenotype and advanced age. There appears to be marked variation in time to clinical response for therapies used in IBD which is further influenced by disease and patient related factors. Understanding the expected time to therapeutic response is integral to inform further decision making, maintain a patient-centered approach and ensure treatment is given an appropriate timeframe to achieve maximal benefit prior to cessation.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31df0ca7640318f9f11decd48dea782e395a6dff

Moreover, when there is exclusive colonic inflammation, diagnosis can be challenging. Our aim was to describe the difficulties and pitfalls in the diagnosis of early-onset IBD (eoIBD) and their repercussions in treatment decisions. Patients and Methods Patients with eoIBD (Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative, and unclassified colitis) treated at our center between 1990 and 2016 were studied retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, medical, and surgical treatment data were analyzed. Results A total of 19 patients were diagnosed with eoIBD at 21 (1–46) months of age. Bloody diarrhea, growth failure, and abdominal pain were present in 90, 42, and 16%, respectively. After 9 (1–62) months from the onset, patients were classified as ulcerative colitis (nine), CD (two), and unclassified colitis (eight). Unresponsiveness to medical treatment was observed in 10 and prompted surgical assessment. A partial colectomy was performed in one, and nine underwent a total colectomy (one end stoma and eight ileoanal anastomosis [IAA]). At least one surgical complication occurred in 80% and ultimately six patients with an IAA required an end stoma. Overtime, final diagnosis of 5 out of the 10 surgical patients changed due to biopsy findings, unresponsiveness to medical treatment, or extraintestinal and perianal manifestations. After a 12-year (1–22) follow-up, 57.9% of the diagnoses of all patients were modified. Conclusion EoIBD poses a challenge due to ambiguous presentation and absence of specific diagnostic tests. Surgical evaluation is often needed and surgeons must be mindful of possible initial misdiagnosis, in addition to short- and long-term outcomes before deciding aggressive surgical measures as well as intestinal reconstruction.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a17fce1f34e204338226763e39923bd06434066d

We sought to characterize the prevalence of perianal disease in a large and diverse population of pediatric patients with CD. Methods: We conducted retrospective analyses from a prospective observational cohort, the ImproveCareNow Network (May 2006–October 2014), a multicenter pediatric inflammatory bowel disease quality improvement collaborative. Clinicians prospectively documented physical examination and phenotype classification at outpatient visits. Perianal examination findings and concomitant phenotype change were used to corroborate time of new-onset perianal disease. Results were stratified by age, sex, and race and compared across groups with logistic regression. Cumulative incidence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared between groups with Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: The registry included 7076 patients with CD (41% girls). Missing/conflicting entries resulted in 397 (6%) patient exclusions. Among the remaining 6679 cases, 1399 (21%) developed perianal disease. Perianal disease was more common among boys (22%) than girls (20%; P = 0.013) and developed sooner after diagnosis among those with later rather than early onset disease (P < 0.001). Perianal disease was also more common among blacks (26%) compared with whites (20%; P = 0.017). Asians with later onset CD developed perianal disease earlier in their disease course (P = 0.01). There was no association between disease location or nutritional status at diagnosis and later development of perianal disease. Conclusions: In this large multicenter collaborative, we found that perianal disease is more common among children with CD than previously recognized. Differences in the development of perianal disease were found across racial and other subgroups. Treatment strategies are needed to prevent perianal disease development.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65aa6940ad26407dc7a2db339ccd253f56848bd4

However, little is known about the role of the IL10 axis in children with VEO-IBD in China. Methods: The Chinese VEO-IBD Collaboration Group was created to collect clinical and genetic data from patients deficient in IL10 and the IL10 receptor. High-throughput sequencing was performed to identify mutations in these genes. Results: We identified 32 compound heterozygous mutations and 9 homozygous mutations in IL10 receptor subunit alpha and 1 homozygous mutation in IL10 receptor subunit beta. Among these mutations, 10 novel mutations were identified, and 6 pathogenic mutations had been previously described. In patients with IL10 receptor subunit alpha mutations, c.301C>T (p.R101RW) and c.537 G>A (p.T179T) were the most common mutations. For 88.1% of the patients, the initial symptom was diarrhea, with a time of onset of 10.4 ± 8.0 days. Oral ulcers were the first symptom in 23.8% of the patients, with a time of onset of 9.7 ± 2.8 days. Extraintestinal manifestations included perianal abscesses (22/42), perianal fistulas (23/42), oral ulcers (20/42), and recurrent eczema (15/42). Twelve patients underwent enterostomy. These patients also had lower average Z scores in height-for-age and weight-for-age. Various treatment strategies were used, including fecal microbiota transplantation; however, only hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was efficacious. Conclusions: This study identified genotypes and phenotypes of Chinese VEO-IBD infants with IL10 receptor mutations.

We compared changes over time in the incidence and phenotype at diagnosis between two groups according to age at IBD diagnosis: VEO-IBD diagnosed before the age of 6 years, and early-onset IBD [EO-IBD] diagnosed between 6 and 16 years of age., , , Methods, Data were obtained from a cohort enrolled in a prospective French population-based registry from 1988 to 2011., , , Results, Among the 1412 paediatric cases [< 17 years], 42 [3%] were VEO-IBD. In the VEO-IBD group, the incidence remained stable over the study period. In contrast, the incidence of EO-IBD increased from 4.4/105 in 1988-1990 to 9.5/105 in 2009-2011 [+116%; p < 10-4]. Crohn's disease [CD] was the most common IBD, regardless of age, but ulcerative colitis [UC] and unclassified IBD were more common in VEO-IBD cases [40% vs 26%; p = 0.04]. VEO-IBD diagnosis was most often performed in hospital [69% vs 43%; p < 10-3]. Rectal bleeding and mucous stools were more common in patients with VEO-IBD, whereas weight loss and abdominal pain were more frequent in those with EO-IBD. Regarding CD, isolated colonic disease was more common in the VEO-IBD group [39% vs 14%; p = 0.003]., , , Conclusions, In this large population-based cohort, the incidence of VEO-IBD was low and stable from 1988 to 2011, with a specific clinical presentation. These results suggest a probable genetic origin for VEO-IBD, whereas the increase in EO-IBD might be linked to environmental factors.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57a2fd50ecc1eb300f5663511aa7fa0bd3fa19fd

We aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children with IO-IBD. METHODS All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 mo of age, seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We performed mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with presenting clinical features of Crohn’s disease (CD). RESULTS Six [13%; CD = 3, ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) = 1] of the 48 children (CD = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review [median (range) duration of follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were in remission without immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U), after standard immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three patients were on immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD) had persistent disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more likely to present with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar in terms of an associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31), requiring biologics therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P = 0.27), or achieving remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10 or IL10R in the three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were identified. CONCLUSION The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission at a similar rate.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/899f20505b59a775411220f377608780c2fa029f

It is now recognized that several genetic defects can express an IBD-like phenotype at very early onset (<6 years). Areas covered: The aim of this review was to update knowledge concerning the specificity of IBD at onset <6 years, which can include conventional/standard IBD as well as monogenic IBD-like diseases. Expert commentary: We found that females are less prone than males to develop monogenic disorders, which have X-linked heritability in several cases. Furthermore, the Crohn’s Diseases (CD) subtype seems to be suggestive of monogenic disorders while Unclassified IBD (IBDU) subtype is predominantly found in conventional/standard IBD at onset <6 years. Isolated colonic location is prevalent in both the subsets of IBD at onset <6 years if compared to IBD at later onset. Monogenic disorders require more aggressive medical and surgical treatments and can be complicated by the occurrence of lymphomas.;Yes;No;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e56495c05ea38c9e23b6fb55fa5fd8022ab094c5

In patients hospitalized for active disease, symptoms and/or altered intestinal function hinder enteral nutrition feasibility. In this scenario, parenteral nutrition (PN) is used. We aimed (1) to assess the frequency of PN use between 1997 and 2012 among hospitalized pediatric patients with IBD, (2) to determine the risk of in-hospital thrombus and infection associated with PN, and (3) to identify predictors of thrombus and infection in pediatric IBD hospitalizations utilizing PN., , , METHODS, We performed a cross-sectional analysis of pediatric patients hospitalized between 1997 and 2012. We used the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) to identify pediatric patients (≤18 years of age) with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), PN exposure, and primary outcomes including thrombus and infection. We used multivariable regression to identify risk factors for outcomes of interest., , , RESULTS, Parenteral nutrition was utilized in 3732 (12%) of 30,914 IBD hospitalizations. Three percent of PN patients experienced a thrombotic complication, and 5.5% experienced an infectious complication. Multivariate analysis showed PN as an independent risk factor for thrombus (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-5.6) and infection (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 3.1-4.6). Surgery was an independent risk factor for thrombus (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7) and infection (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0-3.1) in hospitalizations exposed to PN., , , CONCLUSIONS, Hospitalized pediatric IBD patients, particularly surgical, receiving PN are at increased risk for thrombosis and infection. Clinicians must balance these risks with the benefits of PN.;No;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c169a7ed626931dad44e451b2f9ce49c30ef7d65

Most patients with IBD receive immunosuppressive therapies during the course of the disease. These molecules are a double-edged sword; while they can help control disease activity, they also increase the risk of infections. Therefore, it is important that pediatricians involved in primary care, pediatric gastroenterologists, and infectious disease physicians have a thorough knowledge of the infections that can affect patients with IBD. Areas covered: A broad review of the major infectious diseases that have been reported in children and adolescents with IBD was performed, and information regarding surveillance, diagnosis and management were updated. The possible correlations with IBD pharmacological tools are discussed. Expert commentary: Opportunistic infections are possible in pediatric IBD, and immunosuppressive and immunomodulator therapy seems to play a causative role. Heightened awareness and vigilant surveillance leading to prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for optimal management.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57baf924df230475931c3133b81c3f7edfc1fe7b

A total of 120 UC patients who were admitted to this hospital for treatment between May 2014 and February 2018 were enrolled in this study and divided randomly into the research group and control group, with 60 patients in each group. For patients in the two groups, they underwent medication via mesalazine, while those in the research group additionally received the medication by Bifid Triple Viable Capsules. Following treatment, we evaluated the clinical efficacy, as well as the disease activity index (DAI) of UC, score of clinical symptoms, changes in the inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-10) and the adverse reactions to drugs before and after treatment. The total effectiveness rate in the research group was 90.0%, significantly higher than 72.5% in the control group, and the difference had statistical significance (P < 0.05). Before treatment, we assessed the UCDAI and clinical symptoms, and found that there were no statistically significant differences in these indicators between two groups (P>0.05); however, after treatment, both of UCDAI and clinical symptoms scores were decreased evidently in two groups (P<0.05), while the decreases in the research group were more significant (P < 0.05). In addition, following treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-8 were all decreased in two groups, with an acute increase in IL-10 (all P<0.01), and the alterations in these indicators in the research group were much more significant than those in the control group (all P <0.05). For adverse reactions, the incidence rate in the research group was 6.67%, significantly lower than 33.33% in the control group (P <0.05). Mesalazine in combination with Bifid Triple Viable Capsules shows a magnificent protective effect on the mucosa of UC patients, and curb the UC-related inflammatory reactions effectively. Thus, it is a safe and reliable method that is worthy of being promoted in clinical practice.;No;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c579f00c53597c04df1fc488a2958c3c7cf9e01e

METHODS We reviewed charts from ulcerative colitis patients who had undergone both colonoscopy over 3 years. Clinical assessment of disease severity within 35 d (either before or after) the colonoscopy were included. Patients were excluded if they had significant therapeutic interventions (such as the start of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents) between the colonoscopy and the clinical assessment. Mayo endoscopic score of the rectum and sigmoid were done by two gastroenterologists. Inter-observer variability in Mayo score was assessed. RESULTS We identified 99 patients (53% female, 74% pancolitis) that met inclusion criteria. The indications for colonoscopy included ongoing disease activity (62%), consideration of medication change (10%), assessment of medication efficacy (14%), and cancer screening (14%). Based on PUCAI scores, 33% of patients were in remission, 39% had mild disease, 23% had moderate disease, and 4% had severe disease. There was “moderate-substantial” agreement between the two reviewers in assessing rectal Mayo scores (kappa = 0.54, 95%CI: 0.41-0.68). CONCLUSION Endoscopic disease severity (Mayo score) assessed by reviewing photographs of pediatric colonoscopy has moderate inter-rater reliability, and agreement was less robust in assessing patients with mild disease activity. Endoscopic disease severity generally correlates with clinical disease severity as measured by PUCAI score. However, children with inflamed colons can have significant variation in their reported clinical symptoms. Thus, assessment of both clinical symptoms and endoscopic disease severity may be required in future clinical studies.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3487ab107b3dfb52cb7dc2f7872fa75c27538395

Job remember know.;Poster;Objectives: Our aim was to characterize the temporal changes in burden that Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) added to the hospital care of children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the United States. Methods: Retrospective analysis of annual, nationally representative samples of children and young adults with IBD. Results: There was a 5-fold increase in IBD hospitalizations with CDI from 1997 to 2011 (P for trend <0.01). During the same period, IBD hospitalizations without CDI increased 2-fold (P for trend <0.01). Mean length of stay for IBD hospitalizations with CDI was consistently longer than that for hospitalizations without CDI and did not significantly change over time (P for trend = 0.47). CDI-related total hospital days in the United States rose from 1702 to 10,194 days per million individuals per year from 1997 to 2011 (P for trend <0.01). Children and young adults hospitalized with CDI had a significantly lower odds of colectomy (0.31) compared with those without CDI. Total charges for CDI-related hospitalizations among children and young adults in the United States rose from $8.7 million in 1997 to $68.2 million in 2011. Conclusions: A widening gap in burden has opened between IBD hospitalizations with and without CDI during the last decade and a half. CDI-related hospitalizations are associated with disproportionately longer lengths of stay, more hospital days, and more charges than hospitalizations without CDI over time. Further work within health systems, hospitals, and practices can help us better understand this enlarging gap to improve clinical care for this vulnerable population.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/853f64e24ab25fcac66dbcf6f0ef317666fc45b0

Beyond food condition floor million dark.;FullPaper;Objectives: The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is a noninvasive disease activity index developed as a clinical trial endpoint. More recently, practice guidelines have recommended the use of PUCAI in routine clinical care. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and responsiveness of PUCAI in a large, diverse collection of pediatric gastroenterology practices. Methods: We extracted data from the 2 most recent encounters for patients with ulcerative colitis in the ImproveCareNow registry. Feasibility was determined by the percentage of patients for whom all PUCAI components were recorded, validity by correlation of PUCAI scores across physician global assessment (PGA) categories, and responsiveness to change by the correlation between the change in PUCAI and PGA scores between visits. Results: A total of 2503 patients were included (49.5% boys, age 15.2 ± 4.1 years, disease duration 3.7 ± 3.2 years). All items in the PUCAI were completed for 96% of visits. PUCAI demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability between remission, mild, and moderate disease; discrimination between moderate and severe disease was less robust. There was good correlation with PGA (r = 0.76 [P < 0.001] and weighted kappa &kgr; = 0.73 [P < 0.001]). The PUCAI change scores correlated well with PGA change scores (P < 0.001). Test–retest reliability of the PUCAI was good (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.70–0.75], P < 0.001). Guyatt responsiveness statistic was 1.18, and the correlation of &Dgr;PUCAI with &Dgr;PGA was 0.69 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The PUCAI is feasible to use in routine clinical settings. Evidence of its validity and responsiveness supports its use as a clinical tool for monitoring disease activity for patients with ulcerative colitis.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d711fc48953ba10c4e34ded3132af1a8107fb68

We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that might serve as short term treatment targets. Design A chart review of 115 children with new onset UC was performed (age 11±4.1 years; 58 (50%) males; 86 (75%) extensive colitis; 70 (61%) moderate–severe disease; 63 (55%) received steroids at baseline). We assessed the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, and endoscopy at diagnosis. Results The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)). SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) children who had active disease (PUCAI ≥10) at 3 months (negative predictive value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score >10; (NPV=91%, positive predictive value=52%; p<0.001), implying that PUCAI >10 at 3 months has a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of ≤10. None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate/albumin/haemoglobin; all AUROC<0.6, p>0.05) but baseline PUCAI predicted subsequent acute severe colitis and the need for salvage medical therapy. Conclusions Completeness of the early response appears more important than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using PUCAI<10 as a feasible treatment goal. Our data suggest that treatment escalation should be considered with a PUCAI value of ≥10 at 3 months.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32accf4277395a534a7592a59f1661d2d5909879

Areas covered: In accordance with a published protocol (PROSPERO no. CRD42019118838), we systematically and critically evaluated all published evidence on the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF-α in children with perianal CD, in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and clinicalTrials.gov databases until October, 18th, 2018. We included in our systematic review 29 articles yielding a total of 565 perianal CD patients aged between 9 months to 18 years. Expert opinion: According to low-quality evidence from small, uncontrolled and heterogeneous descriptive studies, and very few randomized controlled trial, nearly three-fifths children with perianal CD achieved remission with anti-TNF-α treatment and in approximately 40% remission was maintained after 12 months, with practically low discontinuation rate due to serious adverse events. More than half of the patients achieved complete fistula closure. There is still a need for more robust evidence adequately assessing the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF-α therapy in pediatric perianal CD, as well as in comparison with other therapies.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67628730e79a7f2ff06799adb34e645b38766235

The multisubband carrier dynamics as well as the polarization dynamics were taken into account. Carrier heating and coherent light-carrier interactions as well as the interplay of these nonlinear processes and the amplifier dispersion are studied. Strong Rabi oscillations occur in the optical field of a propagated pulse, its frequency chirp, as well as in the carrier density and temperature. While the Rabi oscillation imposes negative frequency chirp and hence red-shifts the pulse spectrum, positive frequency chirp can occur due to the local gain dispersion, where the higher frequency components of the pulse have larger gain. Due to the Rabi oscillation, the spectrum of the amplified pulse is considerably distorted and sidebands emerge. For a linearly chirped input pulse, the spectrum of the output pulse can be either red-shifted or blue-shifted with respect to its center frequency, depending on its initial chirp. For strong pulse propagation, a pronounced pulse break up occurs when a 175-fs pulse propagates in the gain regime, while a significant pulse compression occurs when the pulse propagates at the transparency point.;Yes;Yes;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32d9d424d9b3e6a3663ce29f1128582d482443cf

N‐terminal microsequencing revealed sequence identity with a hypothetical polypeptide encoded by the yeast YGL037C open reading frame sharing 30% sequence identity with Escherichia coli pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase. A yeast strain in which the NAMase gene, hereafter named PNC1, was deleted shows a decreased intracellular NAD+ concentration, consistent with the loss of NAMase activity in the null mutant. In wild‐type strains, NAMase activity is stimulated during the stationary phase of growth, by various hyperosmotic shocks or by ethanol treatment. Using a PPNC1::lacZ gene fusion, we have shown that this stimulation of NAMase activity results from increased levels of the protein and requires stress response elements in the 5′ non‐coding region of PNC1. These results suggest that NAMase helps yeast cells to adapt to various stress conditions and nutrient depletion, most likely via the activation of NAD‐dependent biological processes.

Red tonight any author leader market build.;FullPaper;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite with wide-ranging and significant roles in the cell. Defects in NAD+ metabolism have been associated with many human disorders; it is therefore an emerging therapeutic target. Moreover, NAD+ metabolism is perturbed during colonization by a variety of pathogens, either due to the molecular mechanisms employed by these infectious agents or by the host immune response they trigger. Three main biosynthetic pathways, including the de novo and salvage pathways, contribute to the production of NAD+ with a high degree of conservation from bacteria to humans. De novo biosynthesis, which begins with l-tryptophan in eukaryotes, is also known as the kynurenine pathway. Intermediates of this pathway have various beneficial and deleterious effects on cellular health in different contexts. For example, dysregulation of this pathway is linked to neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. Activation of the de novo pathway is also implicated in various infections and inflammatory signaling. Given the dynamic flexibility and multiple roles of NAD+ intermediates, it is important to understand the interconnections and cross-regulations of NAD+ precursors and associated signaling pathways to understand how cells regulate NAD+ homeostasis in response to various growth conditions. Although regulation of NAD+ homeostasis remains incompletely understood, studies in the genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae may help provide some molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors contribute to the maintenance and regulation of cellular function and how they are regulated by various nutritional and stress signals. Here we present a brief overview of recent insights and discoveries made with respect to the relationship between NAD+ metabolism and selected human disorders and infections, with a particular focus on the de novo pathway. We also discuss how studies in budding yeast may help elucidate the regulation of NAD+ homeostasis.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/979f0a2f90ac3b5781d57694953f1bde25ba22f3

The setting up of the spectroscopic and chromatographic conditions for the quantification of the dTRPs in LC-MS/MS system, the optimization of dTRPs’ production in fermentative and whole-cell biotransformation approaches and the production of dTRPs in a soybean-based cultural medium naturally enriched in tryptophan, as a case of study, were included in the experimental plan. Variable amounts of dTRPs, with a prevalence of metabolites of the KYN pathway, were detected. The LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the compound synthesized at highest concentration is KYNA that reached 9.146 ± 0.585 mg/L in fermentation trials in a chemically defined medium at 400 mg/L TRP. Further experiments in a soybean-based medium confirm KYNA as the main dTRPs, whereas the other dTRPs reached very lower concentrations.

Region market care ago American.;ShortPaper;Candida albicans is a pathogenic fungus that causes systemic infections and mortality in immunosuppressed individuals. We previously showed that deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 by Hst3 is essential for C. albicans viability. Hst3 is a fungal‐specific NAD+‐dependent protein deacetylase of the sirtuin family. In vivo, supraphysiological concentrations of nicotinamide (NAM) are required for Hst3 inhibition and cytotoxicity. This underscores the importance of identifying mechanisms by which C. albicans can modulate intracellular NAM concentrations. For the first time in a pathogenic fungus, we combine genetics, heavy isotope labeling, and targeted quantitative metabolomics to identify genes, pathways, and mechanisms by which C. albicans can reduce the cytotoxicity of high NAM concentrations. We discovered three distinct fates for supraphysiological NAM concentrations. First, upon transient exposure to NAM, high intracellular NAM concentrations rapidly return near the physiological levels observed in cells that are not exposed to NAM. Second, during the first step of a fungal‐specific NAM salvage pathway, NAM is converted into nicotinic acid, a metabolite that cannot inhibit the sirtuin Hst3. Third, we provide evidence that NAM enters the NAD+ metabolome through a NAM exchange reaction that contributes to NAM‐mediated inhibition of sirtuins. However, in contrast to the other fates of NAM, the NAM exchange reaction cannot cause a net decrease in the intracellular concentration of NAM. Therefore, this reaction cannot enhance resistance to NAM. In summary, we demonstrate that C. albicans possesses at least two mechanisms to attenuate the cytotoxicity of pharmacological NAM concentrations. It seems likely that those two mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic NAM concentrations are conserved in many other pathogenic fungi.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c3d842c3451f6f8fe9aff78e89ae33205b4d24f

Quickly teach red whether laugh shake democratic.;ShortPaper;Sirtuin 6, SIRT6, is critical for both glucose and lipid homeostasis and is involved in maintaining genomic stability under conditions of oxidative DNA damage such as those observed in age-related diseases. There is an intense search for modulators of SIRT6 activity, however, not many specific activators have been reported. Long acyl-chain fatty acids have been shown to increase the weak in vitro deacetylase activity of SIRT6 but this effect is modest at best. Herein we report that electrophilic nitro-fatty acids (nitro-oleic acid and nitro-conjugated linoleic acid) potently activate SIRT6. Binding of the nitro-fatty acid to the hydrophobic crevice of the SIRT6 active site exerted a moderate activation (2-fold at 20 μm), similar to that previously reported for non-nitrated fatty acids. However, covalent Michael adduct formation with Cys-18, a residue present at the N terminus of SIRT6 but absent from other isoforms, induced a conformational change that resulted in a much stronger activation (40-fold at 20 μm). Molecular modeling of the resulting Michael adduct suggested stabilization of the co-substrate and acyl-binding loops as a possible additional mechanism of SIRT6 activation by the nitro-fatty acid. Importantly, treatment of cells with nitro-oleic acid promoted H3K9 deacetylation, whereas oleic acid had no effect. Altogether, our results show that nitrated fatty acids can be considered a valuable tool for specific SIRT6 activation, and that SIRT6 should be considered as a molecular target for in vivo actions of these anti-inflammatory nitro-lipids.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48923667456cc46ef2b0a1ccb07f8fd1dc004e37

Attack answer leader effort dinner another really difference.;ShortPaper;ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation is a prerequisite to the transcriptional activation of NIC3 in response to ABA. DNA methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of DNA methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. DNA demethylation is a reverse process of DNA methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), active DNA demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from DNA. Here we showed that ros1 mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible genes were decreased in ros1 mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible genes are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation. Notable among them is NICOTINAMIDASE 3 (NIC3) that encodes an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD+ salvage pathway. Many enzymes in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The nic3 mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of NIC3 restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that NIC3 is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active DNA demethylation maintains the active state of NIC3 transcription in response to ABA.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a15f73d8d6c5eb192502070e60b7495d8523e19

Easy week local prove. Sea ago computer agreement travel board.;FullPaper;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite participating in cellular redox chemistry and signaling, and the complex regulation of NAD+ metabolism is not yet fully understood. To investigate this, we established a NAD+-intermediate specific reporter system to identify factors required for salvage of metabolically linked nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinic acid (NA). Mutants lacking components of the NatB complex, NAT3 and MDM20, appeared as hits in this screen. NatB is an Nα-terminal acetyltransferase responsible for acetylation of the N terminus of specific Met-retained peptides. In NatB mutants, increased NA/NAM levels were concomitant with decreased NAD+. We identified the vacuolar pool of nicotinamide riboside (NR) as the source of this increased NA/NAM. This NR pool is increased by nitrogen starvation, suggesting NAD+ and related metabolites may be trafficked to the vacuole for recycling. Supporting this, increased NA/NAM release in NatB mutants was abolished by deleting the autophagy protein ATG14. We next examined Tpm1 (tropomyosin), whose function is regulated by NatB-mediated acetylation, and Tpm1 overexpression (TPM1-oe) was shown to restore some NatB mutant defects. Interestingly, although TPM1-oe largely suppressed NA/NAM release in NatB mutants, it did not restore NAD+ levels. We showed that decreased nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nma1/Nma2) levels probably caused the NAD+ defects, and NMA1-oe was sufficient to restore NAD+. NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of Nma1 and Nma2 appears essential for maintaining NAD+ levels. In summary, our results support a connection between NatB-mediated protein acetylation and NAD+ homeostasis. Our findings may contribute to understanding the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism.;No;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d21b36577a7277b10146c0b023d41aafbec2086f

Movie bag thought growth.;Poster;Nicotinamidases are amidohydrolases that convert nicotinamide into nicotinic acid, contributing to NAD+ homeostasis in most organisms. In order to increase the number of nicotinamidases described to date, this manuscript characterizes a nicotinamidase obtained from a metagenomic library fosmid clone (JFF054_F02) obtained from a geothermal water stream microbial mat community in a Japanese epithermal mine. The enzyme showed an optimum temperature of 90°C, making it the first hyperthermophilic bacterial nicotinamidase to be characterized, since the phylogenetic analysis of this fosmid clone placed it in a clade of uncultured geothermal bacteria. The enzyme, named as UbNic, not only showed an alkaline optimum pH, but also a biphasic pH dependence of its kcat, with a maximum at pH 9.5–10.0. The two pKa values obtained were 4.2 and 8.6 for pKes1 and pKes2, respectively. These results suggest a possible flexible catalytic mechanism for nicotinamidases, which reconciles the two previously proposed mechanisms. In addition, the enzyme showed a high catalytic efficiency, not only toward nicotinamide, but also toward other nicotinamide analogs. Its mutational analysis showed that a tryptophan (W83) is needed in one of the faces of the active site to maintain low Km values toward all the substrates tested. Furthermore, UbNic proved to contain a Fe2+ ion in its metal binding site, and was revealed to belong to a new nicotinamidase subgroup. All these characteristics, together with its high pH- and thermal stability, distinguish UbNic from previously described nicotinamidases, and suggest that a wide diversity of enzymes remains to be discovered in extreme environments.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f39ed42953124a071a5e9e812e2e2d70486d694

This cofactor is known to be unstable, especially at high temperatures, where it chemically decomposes to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose. Bacteria, yeast, and higher organisms possess the salvage pathway for reconstructing NAD+ from these decomposition products; however, the importance of the salvage pathway for survival is not well elucidated, except for in pathogens lacking the NAD+de novo synthesis pathway. Herein, we report the importance of the NAD+ salvage pathway in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 at high temperatures. We identified the gene encoding nicotinamidase (TTHA0328), which catalyzes the first reaction of the NAD+ salvage pathway. This recombinant enzyme has a high catalytic activity against nicotinamide (Km of 17 μM, kcat of 50 s−1, kcat/Km of 3.0 × 103 s−1 · mM−1). Deletion of this gene abolished nicotinamide deamination activity in crude extracts of T. thermophilus and disrupted the NAD+ salvage pathway in T. thermophilus. Disruption of the salvage pathway led to the severe growth retardation at a higher temperature (80°C), owing to the drastic decrease in the intracellular concentrations of NAD+ and NADH. IMPORTANCE NAD+ and other nicotinamide cofactors are essential for cell metabolism. These molecules are unstable and decompose, even under the physiological conditions in most organisms. Thermophiles can survive at high temperatures where NAD+ decomposition is, in general, more rapid. This study emphasizes that NAD+ instability and its homeostasis can be one of the important factors for thermophile survival in extreme temperatures.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64a61cc18c09dc0a2f58479cef0c6b943f42404f

General market yourself safe.;Poster;Changes in histone modifications are an attractive model through which environmental signals, such as diet, could be integrated in the cell for regulating its lifespan. However, evidence linking dietary interventions with specific alterations in histone modifications that subsequently affect lifespan remains elusive. We show here that deletion of histone N‐alpha‐terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and loss of its associated H4 N‐terminal acetylation (N‐acH4) extend yeast replicative lifespan. Notably, nat4Δ‐induced longevity is epistatic to the effects of calorie restriction (CR). Consistent with this, (i) Nat4 expression is downregulated and the levels of N‐acH4 within chromatin are reduced upon CR, (ii) constitutive expression of Nat4 and maintenance of N‐acH4 levels reduces the extension of lifespan mediated by CR, and (iii) transcriptome analysis indicates that nat4Δ largely mimics the effects of CR, especially in the induction of stress‐response genes. We further show that nicotinamidase Pnc1, which is typically upregulated under CR, is required for nat4Δ‐mediated longevity. Collectively, these findings establish histone N‐acH4 as a regulator of cellular lifespan that links CR to increased stress resistance and longevity.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51490a427e64edaa773b1f807ca47031661b024f

NAD+ depletion may play a major role in the aging process at the cellular level by limiting (1) energy production, (2) DNA repair, and (3) genomic signaling. In this study, we hypothesize that it is not NAD+ as a cofactor in redox reactions and coenzyme in metabolic processes that has the ultimate role in aging, but rather the role of NAD+ in cellular signaling when used as substrate for sirtuins (SIRT1-7 in mammals) and PARPs [Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases]. Both sirtuins and PARPs influence many transcription factors and can affect gene expression. As a signaling molecule, NAD+ is consumed in the reaction donating ADP-ribose and releasing nicotinamide (NAM) as a by-product. It seems that aging at the cellular level is associated with a decline of NAD+ and that NAD+ restoration can reverse phenotypes of aging by inducing cellular repair and stress resistance. Adequate intracellular NAD+ concentrations may be an important longevity assurance factor, while lowered cellular NAD+ concentration may negatively influence the life span.;No;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1901b82bbb8510ceff59acbaf0568a673eb34641

Common fungistatic drugs, such as fluconazole, are less toxic for patients but have low efficacy for initial therapy of the disease. Effective therapy against the disease is provided by the fungicidal drug amphotericin B; however, due to its high toxicity and the difficulty in administering its intravenous formulation, it is imperative to find new therapies targeting the fungus. The antiparasitic drug bithionol has been recently identified as having potent fungicidal activity. In this study, we used a combined gene dosing and drug affinity responsive target stability (GD-DARTS) screen as well as protein modeling to identify a common drug binding site of bithionol within multiple NAD-dependent dehydrogenase drug targets. This combination genetic and proteomic method thus provides a powerful method for identifying novel fungicidal drug targets for further development. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcosis is a neglected fungal meningitis that causes approximately half a million deaths annually. The most effective antifungal agent, amphotericin B, was developed in the 1950s, and no effective medicine has been developed for this disease since that time. A key aspect of amphotericin B’s effectiveness is thought to be because of its ability to kill the fungus (fungicidal activity), rather than just stop or slow its growth. The present study utilized a recently identified fungicidal agent, bithionol, to identify potential fungicidal drug targets that can be used in developing modern fungicidal agents. A combined protein and genetic analysis approach was used to identify a class of enzymes, dehydrogenases, that the fungus uses to maintain homeostasis with regard to sugar nutrients. Similarities in the drug target site were found that resulted in simultaneous inhibition and killing of the fungus by bithionol. These studies thus identify a common, multitarget site for antifungal development. Cryptococcosis is a neglected fungal meningitis that causes approximately half a million deaths annually. The most effective antifungal agent, amphotericin B, was developed in the 1950s, and no effective medicine has been developed for this disease since that time. A key aspect of amphotericin B’s effectiveness is thought to be because of its ability to kill the fungus (fungicidal activity), rather than just stop or slow its growth. The present study utilized a recently identified fungicidal agent, bithionol, to identify potential fungicidal drug targets that can be used in developing modern fungicidal agents. A combined protein and genetic analysis approach was used to identify a class of enzymes, dehydrogenases, that the fungus uses to maintain homeostasis with regard to sugar nutrients. Similarities in the drug target site were found that resulted in simultaneous inhibition and killing of the fungus by bithionol. These studies thus identify a common, multitarget site for antifungal development.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b339f54669c071026be132527dc31c6df65e3b5d

Build color significant clear.;ShortPaper;ABSTRACT Riemerella anatipestifer is a major bacterial pathogen that causes septicemic and exudative diseases in domestic ducks. In our previous study, we found that deletion of the AS87_01735 gene significantly decreased the bacterial virulence of R. anatipestifer strain Yb2 (mutant RA625). The AS87_01735 gene was predicted to encode a nicotinamidase (PncA), a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, which is an important reaction in the NAD+ salvage pathway. In this study, the AS87_01735 gene was expressed and identified as the PncA-encoding gene, using an enzymatic assay. Western blot analysis demonstrated that R. anatipestifer PncA was localized to the cytoplasm. The mutant strain RA625 (named Yb2ΔpncA in this study) showed a similar growth rate but decreased NAD+ quantities in both the exponential and stationary phases in tryptic soy broth culture, compared with the wild-type strain Yb2. In addition, Yb2ΔpncA-infected ducks showed much lower bacterial loads in their blood, and no visible histological changes were observed in the heart, liver, and spleen. Furthermore, Yb2ΔpncA immunization of ducks conferred effective protection against challenge with the virulent wild-type strain Yb2. Our results suggest that the R. anatipestifer AS87_01735 gene encodes PncA, which is an important virulence factor, and that the Yb2ΔpncA mutant can be used as a novel live vaccine candidate. IMPORTANCE Riemerella anatipestifer is reported worldwide as a cause of septicemic and exudative diseases of domestic ducks. The pncA gene encodes a nicotinamidase (PncA), a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, which is an important reaction in the NAD+ salvage pathway. In this study, we identified and characterized the pncA-homologous gene AS87_01735 in R. anatipestifer strain Yb2. R. anatipestifer PncA is a cytoplasmic protein that possesses similar PncA activity, compared with other organisms. Generation of the pncA mutant Yb2ΔpncA led to a decrease in the NAD+ content, which was associated with decreased capacity for invasion and attenuated virulence in ducks. Furthermore, Yb2ΔpncA immunization of ducks conferred effective protection against challenge with the virulent wild-type strain Yb2. Altogether, these results suggest that PncA contributes to the virulence of R. anatipestifer and that the Yb2ΔpncA mutant can be used as a novel live vaccine candidate.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/605b4b025dcfc0bf941990fec742b4f9e1575666

These modifications operate both to influence the structure of chromatin per se and to serve as recognition elements for proteins with motifs dedicated to binding particular modifications. Each of these modifications results from an enzyme that consumes one of several important metabolites during catalysis. Likewise, the removal of these marks often results in the consumption of a different metabolite. Therefore, these so-called epigenetic marks have the capacity to integrate the expression state of chromatin with the metabolic state of the cell. This review focuses on the central roles played by acetyl-CoA, S-adenosyl methionine, NAD(+), and a growing list of other acyl-CoA derivatives in epigenetic processes.

Under low glucose conditions, replicative lifespan is extended in a manner that depends on the NAD+-dependent protein lysine deacetylase Sir2 and NAD+ salvage enzymes. Because NAD+ is required for glucose utilization and Sir2 function, it was postulated that glucose levels alter the levels of NAD+ metabolites that tune Sir2 function. Though NAD+ precursor vitamins, which increase the levels of all NAD+ metabolites, can extend yeast replicative lifespan, glucose restriction does not significantly change the levels or ratios of intracellular NAD+ metabolites. To test whether glucose restriction affects protein copy numbers, we developed a technology that combines the measurement of Urh1 specific activity and quantification of relative expression between Urh1 and any other protein. The technology was applied to obtain the protein copy numbers of enzymes involved in NAD+ metabolism in rich and synthetic yeast media. Our data indicated that Sir2 and Pnc1, two enzymes that sequentially convert NAD+ to nicotinamide and then to nicotinic acid, are up-regulated by glucose restriction in rich media, and that Pnc1 alone is up-regulated in synthetic media while levels of all other enzymes are unchanged. These data suggest that production or export of nicotinic acid might be a connection between NAD+ and calorie restriction-mediated lifespan extension in yeast.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50ac50815d873a352d7199aff213ad42f00892b5

Recently, a β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase Gas1 has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of transcriptional silencing in S. cerevisiae. Here, we show that the gas1Δ mutation increases rDNA silencing in a Sir2-dependent manner. Remarkably, the gas1Δ mutation induces nuclear localization of Msn2/4 and stimulates the expression of PNC1, a gene encoding a nicotinamidase that functions as a Sir2 activator. The lack of enzymatic activity of Gas1 or treatment with a cell wall-damaging agent, Congo red, exhibits effects similar to those of the gas1Δ mutation. Furthermore, the loss of Gas1 or Congo red treatment lowers the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in a cell wall integrity MAP kinase Slt2-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest that the dysfunction of Gas1 plays a positive role in the maintenance of rDNA integrity by decreasing PKA activity and inducing the accumulation of Msn2/4 in the nucleus. It seems that nuclear-localized Msn2/4 stimulate the expression of Pnc1, thereby enhancing the association of Sir2 with rDNA and promoting rDNA stability.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7709f0b71d876d4af5043b7a62ca1e02eae9c6c

Hope president news drug.;FullPaper;Nicotinamidase (Pnc1) is a member of Zn-dependent amidohydrolases that hydrolyzes nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinic acid (NA), which is a key step in the salvage pathway of NAD(+) biosynthesis. In this paper, the catalytic mechanism of Pnc1 has been investigated by using a combined quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) approach based on the recently obtained crystal structure of Pnc1. The reaction pathway, the detail of each elementary step, the energetics of the whole catalytic cycle, and the roles of key residues and Zn-binding site are illuminated. Our calculation results indicate that the catalytic water molecule comes from the bulk solvent, which is then deprotonated by residue D8. D8 functions as a proton transfer station between C167 and NAM, while the activated C167 serves as the nucleophile. The residue K122 only plays a role in stabilizing intermediates and transition states. The oxyanion hole formed by the amide backbone nitrogen atoms of A163 and C167 has the function to stabilize the hydroxyl anion of nicotinamide. The Zn-binding site rather than a single Zn(2+) ion acts as a Lewis acid to influence the reaction. Two elementary steps, the activation of C167 in the deamination process and the decomposition of catalytic water in the hydrolysis process, correspond to the large energy barriers of 25.7 and 28.1 kcal mol(-1), respectively, meaning that both of them contribute a lot to the overall reaction barrier. Our results may provide useful information for the design of novel and efficient Pnc1 inhibitors and related biocatalytic applications.;Yes;No;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b02761875b824036731c6be0cd2938019c7c85e5

But unexpected complications in assays of SIRT1 activity have made it unclear whether compounds thought to be sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) are really direct regulators of the enzyme. Further exploration of these effects by Hubbard et al. (p. 1216; see the Perspective by Yuan and Marmorstein) revealed that interaction of SIRT1 with certain substrates allows activation of SIRT1 by STACs and identified critical amino acids in SIRT1 required for these effects. Mouse myoblasts reconstituted with SIRT1 mutated at this amino acid lost their responsiveness to STACs. An interaction of the deacetylase SIRT1 with its substrate offers a possible explanation for some effects on aging. [Also see Perspective by Yuan and Marmorstein] A molecule that treats multiple age-related diseases would have a major impact on global health and economics. The SIRT1 deacetylase has drawn attention in this regard as a target for drug design. Yet controversy exists around the mechanism of sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs). We found that specific hydrophobic motifs found in SIRT1 substrates such as PGC-1α and FOXO3a facilitate SIRT1 activation by STACs. A single amino acid in SIRT1, Glu230, located in a structured N-terminal domain, was critical for activation by all previously reported STAC scaffolds and a new class of chemically distinct activators. In primary cells reconstituted with activation-defective SIRT1, the metabolic effects of STACs were blocked. Thus, SIRT1 can be directly activated through an allosteric mechanism common to chemically diverse STACs.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6040754d26d7e8dc3bda99ecb1e4bbf7cd5521d4

This paper reports a new nicotinamidase from the deep-sea extremely halotolerant and alkaliphilic Oceanobacillus iheyensis HTE831 (OiNIC). The enzyme was active towards nicotinamide and several analogues, including the prodrug pyrazinamide. The enzyme was more nicotinamidase (kcat/Km = 43.5 mM−1s−1) than pyrazinamidase (kcat/Km = 3.2 mM−1s−1). Mutational analysis was carried out on seven critical amino acids, confirming for the first time the importance of Cys133 and Phe68 residues for increasing pyrazinamidase activity 2.9- and 2.5-fold, respectively. In addition, the change in the fourth residue involved in the ion metal binding (Glu65) was detrimental to pyrazinamidase activity, decreasing it 6-fold.

Results: INAM unexpectedly increased the intracellular NAD+ concentration when added to growth medium. Conclusion: INAM-induced increases in NAD+ concentration require significant contributions from the NAD+ and nicotinamide riboside salvage pathways. Significance: INAM appears to promote NAD+ homeostasis, which favors Sir2-dependent processes. Sirtuins are an evolutionarily conserved family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that function in the regulation of gene transcription, cellular metabolism, and aging. Their activity requires the maintenance of an adequate intracellular NAD+ concentration through the combined action of NAD+ biosynthesis and salvage pathways. Nicotinamide (NAM) is a key NAD+ precursor that is also a byproduct and feedback inhibitor of the deacetylation reaction. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nicotinamidase Pnc1 converts NAM to nicotinic acid (NA), which is then used as a substrate by the NAD+ salvage pathway enzyme NA phosphoribosyltransferase (Npt1). Isonicotinamide (INAM) is an isostere of NAM that stimulates yeast Sir2 deacetylase activity in vitro by alleviating the NAM inhibition. In this study, we determined that INAM stimulates Sir2 through an additional mechanism in vivo, which involves elevation of the intracellular NAD+ concentration. INAM enhanced normal silencing at the rDNA locus but only partially suppressed the silencing defects of an npt1Δ mutant. Yeast cells grown in media lacking NA had a short replicative life span, which was extended by INAM in a SIR2-dependent manner and correlated with increased NAD+. The INAM-induced increase in NAD+ was strongly dependent on Pnc1 and Npt1, suggesting that INAM increases flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway. Part of this effect was mediated by the NR salvage pathways, which generate NAM as a product and require Pnc1 to produce NAD+. We also provide evidence suggesting that INAM influences the expression of multiple NAD+ biosynthesis and salvage pathways to promote homeostasis during stationary phase.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14af7c445891d84d80c4ddfc4725a63da30aab36

Nicotinamidases are absent in mammals but function in NAD(+) salvage in many bacteria, yeast, plants, protozoa, and metazoans. We have performed structural and kinetic investigations of the nicotinamidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pnc1). Steady-state product inhibitor analysis revealed an irreversible reaction in which ammonia is the first product released, followed by nicotinic acid. A series of nicotinamide analogues acting as inhibitors or substrates were examined, revealing that the nicotinamide carbonyl oxygen and ring nitrogen are critical for binding and reactivity. X-ray structural analysis revealed a covalent adduct between nicotinaldehyde and Cys167 of Pnc1 and coordination of the nicotinamide ring nitrogen to the active-site zinc ion. Using this structure as a guide, the function of several residues was probed via mutagenesis and primary (15)N and (13)C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on V/K for amide bond hydrolysis. The KIE values of almost all variants were increased, indicating that C-N bond cleavage is at least partially rate limiting; however, a decreased KIE for D51N was indicative of a stronger commitment to catalysis. In addition, KIE values using slower alternate substrates indicated that C-N bond cleavage is at least partially rate limiting with nicotinamide to highly rate limiting with thionicotinamide. A detailed mechanism involving nucleophilic attack of Cys167, followed by elimination of ammonia and then hydrolysis to liberate nicotinic acid, is discussed. These results will aid in the design of mechanism-based inhibitors to target pathogens that rely on nicotinamidase activity.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a01089b2c1c7c2dc38b53fd7a3b736370857beb9

Genomics‐based reconstruction of NAD+ metabolism revealed that Leishmania protozoan parasites are NAD+ auxotrophs. Consequently, these parasites require assimilating NAD+ precursors (nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide riboside) from their host environment to synthesize NAD+ by a salvage pathway. Nicotinamidase is a key enzyme of this salvage pathway that catalyses conversion of nicotinamide (NAm) to nicotinic acid (Na), and that is absent in higher eukaryotes. We present here the biochemical and functional characterizations of the Leishmania infantum nicotinamidase (LiPNC1). Generation of Lipnc1 null mutants leads to a decrease in NAD+ content, associated with a metabolic shutdown‐like phenotype with an extensive lag phase of growth. Both phenotypes could be rescued by an add‐back construct or by addition of exogenous Na. In addition, Lipnc1 null mutants were unable to establish a sustained infection in a murine experimental model. Altogether, these results illustrate that NAD+ homeostasis is a fundamental component of Leishmania biology and virulence, and that NAm constitutes its main NAD+ source in the mammalian host.

In Borrelia burgdorferi, the nicotinamidase enzyme, PncA, is required for spirochaete survival throughout the infectious cycle. Mammals lack nicotinamidases and therefore PncA may serve as a therapeutic target for Lyme disease. Contrary to the in vivo importance of PncA, the current annotation for the pncA ORF suggests that the encoded protein may be inactive due to the absence of an N-terminal aspartic acid residue that is a conserved member of the catalytic triad of characterized PncA proteins. Herein, we have used genetic and biochemical strategies to determine the N-terminal sequence of B. burgdorferi PncA. Our data demonstrate that the PncA protein is 24 aa longer than the currently annotated sequence and that pncA translation is initiated from the rare, non-canonical initiation codon AUU.

NAD+ biosynthesis is required for two different regimens that extend lifespan in yeast. NAD+ is synthesized from tryptophan and the three vitamin precursors of NAD+: nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside. Supplementation of yeast cells with NAD+ precursors increases intracellular NAD+ levels and extends replicative lifespan. Here we show that both nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid are not only vitamins but are also exported metabolites. We found that the deletion of the nicotinamide riboside transporter, Nrt1, leads to increased export of nicotinamide riboside. This discovery was exploited to engineer a strain to produce high levels of extracellular nicotinamide riboside, which was recovered in purified form. We further demonstrate that extracellular nicotinamide is readily converted to extracellular nicotinic acid in a manner that requires intracellular nicotinamidase activity.

High front ask.;FullPaper;The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic increase in acutely ill patients presenting to hospitals with life-threatening acute respiratory disease. There was an immediate need for effective triage systems to facilitate clinical decision making. This review assesses the performance of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) in two contexts. Firstly, the ability to detect acute illness severity and likely clinical deterioration in patients presenting to hospitals with COVID-19. Secondly, the use of NEWS2 in the longitudinal monitoring to detect acute clinical deterioration in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. NEWS2 appeared to be at least comparable and, often, superior to other scoring systems (such as qSOFA and CURB-65), and provided an earlier alert of deterioration. A NEWS2 of 5 had high short-term sensitivity within and was unlikely to miss patients with COVID-19 who go on to deteriorate, but this comes with moderate specificity. However, the specificity of these systems is likely underestimated because preventing deterioration is their purpose.NEWS2 is an adjunct to clinical decision making and has served that purpose during the COVID-19 pandemic, playing an important role in communicating illness severity, clinical deterioration, triaging patients to appropriate levels of care and prompting completion of treatment escalation plans for those with high scores and at imminent risk of deterioration.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45a9cadce5abee8c36ee9fbc68d59016bd377153

DESIGN: Prospective randomized physiologic crossover multicenter trial. SETTINGS: Four ICUs in Marseille, France. PATIENTS: Seventeen patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and Pao2/Fio2 less than or equal to 300 mm Hg while treated with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Periods of APP and semirecumbent position (SRP) were randomly applied for 2 hours and separated by a 2-hour washout period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial blood gases, end-tidal CO2. and esophageal pressure were recorded prior to and at the end of each period. Inspiratory muscle effort was assessed by measuring the esophageal pressure swing (∆PES) and the simplified esophageal pressure–time product (sPTPES). The other endpoints included physiologic dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and the transpulmonary pressure swing. The APP increased the Pao2/Fio2 from 84 Torr (61–137 Torr) to 208 Torr (114–226 Torr) (p = 0.0007) and decreased both the VD/VT and the respiratory rate from 0.54 (0.47–0.57) to 0.49 (0.45–0.53) (p = 0.012) and from 26 breaths/min (21–30 breaths/min) to 21 breaths/min (19–22 breaths/min), respectively (p = 0.002). These variables remained unchanged during the SRP. The ∆PES and sPTPES per breath were unaffected by the position. However, the APP reduced the sPTPES per minute from 225 cm H2O.s.m–1 (176–332 cm H2O.s.m–1) to 174 cm H2O.s.m–1 (161–254 cm H2O.s.m–1) (p = 0.049).

We evaluated the utility and relationship of ROX and mROX indexes in COVID-19 patients started on HFNC oxygen therapy. Methods This pilot study collected data from adult COVID-19 patients requiring HFNC oxygenation from 29 Jan - 29 Jun 2021. The patients were divided into two cohorts based on HFNC therapy success. ROX and mROX were compared using statistical diagnostic testing, including receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (AUC) using online Epitools (https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/) and MedCalc software (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium, https://www.medcalc.org/); p<0.05 was considered significant. Results Twenty-seven patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 48.15% of therapy failed. The cohort's mean ± standard deviation age was 53.93 ± 10.67 years; 74.1% were male. The accuracy of predicting failure for mean ROX versus mROX at baseline and six-hour values was 59.81 versus 70.68 and 67.42 versus 74.88, respectively (all p>0.05). The AUC for ROX and mROX at baseline and at six hours were statistically indifferent. Only an mROX of 4.05 (mean value) and 3.34 (Youden’s J cut-off) had a sensitivity plus specificity at 156% and 163%, respectively. Conclusion Both ROX and mROX at baseline and six hours had fair-to-good accuracies and AUC; the differences were insignificant. Both ROX and mROX had better accuracies at six hours. However, only mROX < 4.05 at six hours fulfilled the sensitivity plus specificity criteria to be a clinically valuable screener.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13ef2b4e6f8f3c53ec1a1b8a7da2a0ce18d93549

We aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness of HFNO versus NRBM in terms of improving patient outcome among patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: In this prospective open labelled study, 122 COVID-19 patients presenting with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) were randomised to receive either HFNO or NRBM to achieve the target SpO2. The primary clinical outcome measured was device failure rate and secondary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality rate. Results: The device failure rate was significantly higher in HFNO group (39% versus 21%, P = 0.030). Oxygen support with NRBM resulted in a reduced all mortality rate over HFNO (26.2% versus 45%) but the mortality rate after treatment failure in either group (HFNO or NRBM) remained high (91% versus 92%). Conclusion: Oxygen support with NRBM results in both reduced device failure rate and higher survival among patients of COVID-19 with AHRF.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2c68e4abca0ea30d742f7daeb2ebfa4f87a77c0

Methods In this study we investigated patterns of lung and heart injury from 46 community-based, pre-hospital COVID-19-attributable deaths who underwent autopsy. Results The cohort comprised 22 females and 24 males, median age 64 years (range 19–91) at time of death with illness duration range 0–23 days. Comorbidities associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 included obesity (body mass index >30 kg·m−2) in 19 out of 46 cases (41.3%). Diffuse alveolar damage in its early exudative phase was the most common pattern of lung injury; however significant heterogeneity was identified with bronchopneumonia, pulmonary oedema consistent with acute cardiac failure, pulmonary thromboembolism and microthrombosis also identified and often in overlapping patterns. Review of clinical records and next of kin accounts suggested a combination of unexpectedly low symptom burden, rapidly progressive disease and psychosocial factors may have contributed to a failure of hospital presentation prior to death. Conclusions Identifying such advanced acute lung injury in community-based deaths is extremely unusual and raises the question why some with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis were not hospitalised. Multiple factors including low symptom burden, rapidly progressive disease trajectories and psychosocial factors provide possible explanations. Heterogeneous, overlapping and severe cardiopulmonary histopathological states occur following #COVID19 deaths in the community.

The presence of diabetes plays an important role in the severity of the infection, and a rise in newly diagnosed diabetes cases has been identified. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of new-onset diabetes (NOD) and predictive factors with their cut-off values for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. All patients (n = 219) hospitalized for COVID-19 during three consecutive months were included. NOD was diagnosed in 26.48% of patients. The severity of the infection, hospital admission values for fasting plasma glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the peak values for leucocytes, neutrophils, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and the need for care in the intensive care unit were predictors for the occurrence of NOD in univariate analysis, while only LDH level remained a significant predictor in the multivariable analysis. In conclusion, the results of the study showed a high incidence of NOD in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and identified LDH levels at hospital admission as a significant predictor of NOD during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the persistence of NOD after the COVID-19 infection is not known, therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48110490eff507d69f484325ba0bf46c89c96b28

Paper national yes.;ShortPaper;ABSTRACT Some chronic respiratory diseases can cause hypoxemia and, in such cases, long-term home oxygen therapy (LTOT) is indicated as a treatment option primarily to improve patient quality of life and life expectancy. Home oxygen has been used for more than 70 years, and support for LTOT is based on two studies from the 1980s that demonstrated that oxygen use improves survival in patients with COPD. There is evidence that LTOT has other beneficial effects such as improved cognitive function, improved exercise capacity, and reduced hospitalizations. LTOT is indicated in other respiratory diseases that cause hypoxemia, on the basis of the same criteria as those used for COPD. There has been an increase in the use of LTOT, probably because of increased life expectancy and a higher prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, as well as greater availability of LTOT in the health care system. The first Brazilian Thoracic Association consensus statement on LTOT was published in 2000. Twenty-two years later, we present this updated version. This document is a nonsystematic review of the literature, conducted by pulmonologists who evaluated scientific evidence and international guidelines on LTOT in the various diseases that cause hypoxemia and in specific situations (i.e., exercise, sleep, and air travel). These recommendations, produced with a view to clinical practice, contain several charts with information on indications for LTOT, oxygen sources, accessories, strategies for improved efficiency and effectiveness, and recommendations for the safe use of LTOT, as well as a LTOT prescribing model.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab7d1a5e7082c82fce6e760729908bba95d18fef

However, the generalizability of these scores with regard to different populations, clinical settings, healthcare systems, and new epidemiological circumstances is unknown. The aim of our study was to compare the predictive validity of qSOFA, CRB65, NEWS, COVID-GRAM, and 4C-Mortality score. In a monocentric retrospective cohort, consecutively hospitalized adults with COVID-19 from February 2020 to June 2021 were included; risk scores at admission were calculated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision–recall curve were compared using DeLong’s method and a bootstrapping approach. A total of 347 patients were included; 23.6% were admitted to the ICU, and 9.2% died in a hospital. NEWS and 4C-Score performed best for the outcomes ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. The easy-to-use bedside score NEWS has proven to identify patients at risk for critical illness, whereas the more complex COVID-19-specific scores 4C and COVID-GRAM were not superior. Decreasing mortality and ICU-admission rates affected the discriminatory ability of all scores.

COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, is a highly contagious respiratory disease transmissible mainly via close contact and respiratory droplets which can result in severe, life-threatening respiratory pathologies. It is understood that glutathione, a naturally occurring antioxidant known for its role in immune response and cellular detoxification, is the target of various proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors resulting in the infection, replication, and production of reactive oxygen species. This leads to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 and increased susceptibility to other illnesses such as tuberculosis. The emergence of vaccines against COVID-19, usage of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for infection, and implementation of pharmaceutical drugs have been effective methods for preventing and treating symptoms. However, with the mutating nature of the virus, other treatment modalities have been in research. With its role in antiviral defense and immune response, glutathione has been heavily explored in regard to COVID-19. Glutathione has demonstrated protective effects on inflammation and downregulation of reactive oxygen species, thereby resulting in less severe symptoms of COVID-19 infection and warranting the discussion of glutathione as a treatment mechanism.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e16aecfd015494b81f7297de341880cedcd8426

Given the increased respiratory work of these patients, it is necessary to evaluate their actual breathing efforts. The aim of this study is to report the incidence and determinants of increased effort of breathing (EOB) in critical COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU during the year of 2020. Respiratory rate (RR) was chosen as an indicator of EOB. The cut-off value was set at more than 20 breaths per minute. ROC-AUC analysis was performed to identify the accuracy of the PaO2 and PaCO2 to determine increased EOB. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis was performed to reveal the determinants of increased EOB. Results: 213 patients were included in the study. Mean RR in the population was 24.20 ± 6.28. 138 (64.8%) of the patients had increased EOB. The ROC-AUC analysis revealed the PaO2 (0.656 (CI 95%: 0.579–0.734, p < 0.001) as more accurate predictor of EOB than PaCO2 (0.584 (CI 95%: 0.505–0.662, p = 0.043). In the final multivariate model, the SpO2 (exp(B) = 0.922, CI 95%: 0.874–0.97 p = 0.033), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (exp(B) = 0.996, CI 95%: 0.922–1.000, p = 0.003) and PaO2 (exp(B) = 0.989 CI 95%: 0.982–0.996 p = 0.003) prevailed as independent predictors of increased EOB. Conclusions: To conclude, PaO2 was revealed as a more accurate predictor of increased EOB than PaCO2.

Camera college end responsibility less off medical treat.;ShortPaper;Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide. However, one epidemiological report has claimed a lower incidence of the disease in people living at high altitude (>2,500 m), proposing the hypothesis that adaptation to hypoxia may prove to be advantageous with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This publication was initially greeted with skepticism, because social, genetic, or environmental parametric variables could underlie a difference in susceptibility to the virus for people living in chronic hypobaric hypoxia atmospheres. Moreover, in some patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, early post-infection ‘happy hypoxia” requires immediate ventilation, since it is associated with poor clinical outcome. If, however, we accept to consider the hypothesis according to which the adaptation to hypoxia may prove to be advantageous with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection, identification of the molecular rational behind it is needed. Among several possibilities, HIF-1 regulation appears to be a molecular hub from which different signaling pathways linking hypoxia and COVID-19 are controlled. Interestingly, HIF-1α was reported to inhibit the infection of lung cells by SARS-CoV-2 by reducing ACE2 viral receptor expression. Moreover, an association of the rs11549465 variant of HIF-1α with COVID-19 susceptibility was recently discovered. Here, we review the evidence for a link between HIF-1α, ACE2 and AT1R expression, and the incidence/severity of COVID-19. We highlight the central role played by the HIF-1α signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ca58970c08852e01712feb13241b4eaa80165db

Film green lawyer address natural town place.;FullPaper;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a predominantly respiratory infectious disease caused by novel coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory failure is the main clinical manifestation and the leading cause of death. Even though it can meet the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Berlin definition, only some clinical features of COVID-19 are consistent with typical ARDS, and which has its own peculiar phenotypes. When compared with typical ARDS, in addition to the typical diffuse alveolar injury, COVID-19 has unique pathological and pathophysiological features, such as endothelial injury, extensive microthrombus, and pulmonary capillary hyperplasia. The clinical features of patients with respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 are heterogeneous and can be generally divided into two phenotypes: progressive respiratory distress and unique “silent hypoxemia”. The “H-type” characteristics of reduced lung volume, decreased lung compliance, and unmatched ventilator-perfusion ratio.

Sit field marriage issue tell hospital two ok., Explain tend bit certain.;Certain several become develop eat affect similar. Soldier put public turn image sister. Project to under.;ShortPaper;Background The clinical presentation of COVID-19 suggests altered breathing control - tachypnoea, relative lack of dyspnoea, and often a discrepancy between severity of clinical and radiological findings. Few studies characterize and analyse the contribution of breathing drivers and their ventilatory and perceptual responses. Aim To establish the prevalence of inappropriate ventilatory and perceptual response in COVID-19, by characterizing the relationships between respiratory rate (RR), dyspnoea and arterial blood gas (ABG) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients at presentation to hospital, and their post-Covid respiratory sequelae at follow-up. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study including consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020. In those with concurrent ABG, RR and documented dyspnoea status on presentation, we documented patient characteristics, disease severity, and outcomes at hospital and 6-week post-discharge. Results Of 492 admissions, 194 patients met the inclusion criteria. Tachypnoea was present in 75% pronounced (RR>30) in 36%, and persisted during sleep. RR correlated with heart rate (HR) (r = 0.2674), temperature (r = 0.2824), CRP (r = 0.2561), Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient (r = 0.4189), and lower PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio (r = −0.3636). RR was not correlated with any neurological symptoms. Dyspnoea was correlated with RR (r = 0.2932), A-a gradient (r = 0.1723), and lower PF ratio (r = −0.1914), but not correlated with PaO2 (r = −0.1095), PaCO2 (r = −0.0598) or any recorded neurological symptom except for altered consciousness. Impaired ventilatory homeostatic control of pH/PaCO2 [tachypnoea (RR>20), hypocapnia (PaCO2 <4.6 kPa), and alkalosis (pH>7.45)] was observed in 29%. This group, of which 37% reported no dyspnoea, had more severe respiratory disease (A-a gradient 38.9 vs. 12.4 mmHg; PF ratio 120 vs. 238), and higher prevalence of anosmia (21 vs. 15%), dysgeusia (25 vs. 12%), headache (33 vs. 23%) and nausea (33 vs. 14%) with similar rates of new anxiety/depression (26 vs. 23%), but lower incidence of past neurological or psychiatric diagnoses (5 vs. 21%) compared to appropriate responders. Only 5% had hypoxia sufficiently severe to drive breathing (i.e. PaO2 <6.6 kPa). At 6 weeks post-discharge, 24% (8/34) showed a new breathing pattern disorder with no other neurological findings, nor previous respiratory, neurological, or psychiatric disorder diagnoses. Conclusions Impaired homeostatic control of ventilation i.e., tachypnoea, despite hypocapnia to the point of alkalosis appears prevalent in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, a finding typically accompanying more severe disease. Tachypnoea prevalence was between 12 and 29%. Data suggest that excessive tachypnoea is driven by both peripheral and central mechanisms, but not hypoxia. Over a third of patients with impaired homeostatic ventilatory control did not experience dyspnoea despite tachypnoea. A subset of followed-up patients developed post-covid breathing pattern disorder.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b103783597c4f24e70dae6b48cdd661d6ed948c

Only kitchen who quickly.;FullPaper;COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is characterized by acute respiratory failure like ARDS with endothelial dysfunction and microand macrovascular involvement, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in about 5–23% of the cases [1–3] with high mortality [3, 4]. Most of hospitalized patients have hypoxemic respiratory failure, are old, or have comorbidities [3]. The capability of preventing serious illness with early interventions or managing severe disease could be essential to improve the patients’ outcomes. Better understanding of patients who will progress to acute respiratory insufficiency could help to better monitoring, correct time for possible medications, and choosing the best progressive respiratory support [5, 6]. Early detection of parameters that can predict poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients as old age, multiple comorbidities, high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and severe hypoxemia at admission [7] can help to improve intensive assistance and monitoring. COVID-19 patients that are hospitalized because of acute respiratory failure (20–40% patients) have viral pneumonia that can improve along time or evolve to ARDS, multiple organ failure, and death. These patients can also have complications as pulmonary embolism and secondary infections that must be diagnosed and treated [1, 2]. Monitoring of COVID-19 acute respiratory failure patients includes the following parameters: level of consciousness, capacity to protect the airways, respiratory drive and inspiratory muscles strength and endurance, respiratory rate, arterial gases with emphasis to PaO/ FIO2 ratio, PaCO2 and pH, and respiratory imaging in COVID-19; a thoracic angiotomography can evaluate the lungs parenchyma as well as the pulmonary vascular bed, and a dual-energy tomography can also evaluate the lungs perfusion [8]. Systemic parameters such as arterial pressure, cardiac function (especially cardiac ischemia and arrhythmias), renal function, and hydric balance can be important parameters in specific patients.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e42f22084b9f697ca826dc87b8a489b9f73fd900

Media only hit. Responsibility really view soon race.;Poster;We have previously identified methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine dye approved for clinical use for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications, as a small-molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and ACE2, the first critical step of the attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that methylene blue concentration-dependently inhibits this PPI for the spike protein of the original strain as well as for those of variants of concerns such as the D614G mutant and delta (B.1.617.2) with IC50 in the low micromolar range (1-5 μM). Methylene blue also showed promiscuous activity and inhibited several other PPIs of viral proteins (e.g., HCoV-NL63 – ACE2, hepatitis C virus E – CD81) as well as others (e.g., IL-2 – IL-2Rα) with similar potency. This non-specificity notwithstanding, methylene blue inhibited the entry of pseudoviruses bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2-expressing host cells both for the original strain and the delta variant. It also blocked SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.5) virus replication in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.7 μM) when assayed using quantitative PCR of the viral RNA. Thus, while it seems to be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor with low micromolar activity and it has a relatively narrow therapeutic index, methylene blue inhibits entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, including several of its mutant variants, and has potential as a possible inexpensive, broad-spectrum, orally bioactive small-molecule antiviral for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc7a9d376bfa68f697c368b8ba89ddc6ea8820ef

However, the efficacy and safety of HaH in elderly patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. In Kyoto city, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of HaH care focused on elderly COVID-19 patients from 4 February to 25 June 2021. Eligible patients were (1) COVID-19 patients aged ≥70 years and those who lived with them or (2) COVID-19 patients aged <70 years with special circumstances and those who lived with them. During the study period, 100 patients received HaH care. Their median age was 76 years (interquartile range 56–83), and 65% were over 70 years. Among 100 patients, 36 (36%) had hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤ 92%), 21 (21%) received steroid medication, and 34 (34%) received intravenous fluids. Although 22 patients were admitted to the hospital and 3 patients died there, no patients died during HaH care. HaH care may be safe and effective in elderly patients with COVID-19. Our study shows that HaH provides an alternative strategy for treating COVID-19 patients and can reduce the healthcare burden at hospitals.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c48daaca913fc42214015d31d82eea68cf8237de

Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 based on data of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction test from January to April 2020 in Gyeonggi-do, the largest province in Korea. Results Of the 502 patients, 298 consisting of 106 clusters with 5,909 contacts were included. Of these, 277 (93.0%) were symptomatic, and the most common symptoms were cough, fever, sputum, sore throat, and headache. A total of 94 patients (31.5%) had pneumonia, while 8 (2.7%) died during the follow-up period. The secondary attack rate (SAR) in the study population was 3.5% (204/5,909). In exposure settings, the SAR was higher in religious gathering (13.5% [95% confidence interval, 10.7–16.8%]), workplaces (8.49% [95% CI, 6.08–11.74%]), and schools (6.38% [95% CI, 3.39–11.69%]) than in health care facilities (1.92% [95% CI, 1.45–2.55%]). Sore throat at any period, dyspnea at diagnosis or any period, lower cycle threshold value in the lower respiratory tract samples, leukocytosis, and higher bilirubin levels were associated with higher infectivity of COVID-19. The presence of symptoms was not related to the infectivity.

COVID-19 ARDS patients, within the first 48 h of the need for a non-invasive respiratory support, were retrospectively enrolled. Respiratory support was provided by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or by non-invasive ventilation. One hundred and four patients were enrolled, 84% treated with CPAP and 16% with non-invasive ventilation. Using the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach, 40% and 32% of patients presented respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respectively; 13% did not present acid-base disorders. Using Stewart’s approach, 43% and 33% had a respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respectively; 12% of patients had a mixed disorder characterized by normal pH with a lower SID. The severe hypoxemic and moderate hypoxemic group presented similar frequencies of respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. The most frequent acid-base disorders were respiratory and metabolic alkalosis using both the Henderson–Hasselbalch and Stewart’s approach. Stewart’s approach detected mixed disorders with a normal pH probably generated by the combined effect of strong ions and weak acids.

In this review, the hematological changes are evaluated, with particular focus on the morphology and metabolic aspects of erythrocytes. Changes in the functionality of such cells may, in fact, help provide important information about disease severity and progression. The viral infection causes significant damage to the blood cells that are altered in size, rigidity, and distribution width. Lower levels of hemoglobin and anemia have been reported in several studies, and an alteration in the concentration of antioxidant enzymes has been shown to promote a dangerous state of oxidative stress in red blood cells. Patients with severe COVID-19 showed an increase in hematological changes, indicating a progressive worsening as COVID-19 severity progressed. Therefore, monitored hematological alterations in patients with COVID-19 may play an important role in the management of the disease and prevent the risk of a severe course of the disease.

The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies recommended “supportive care only” avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of “what was working and what wasn’t working”, the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and non-antiviral co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/609e074dd9f8e1cf775c51964abbad19e3fcf86e

One hypothesis to explain the apparent disconnect between severe hypoxemia and the reported absence of dyspnea is a blunted hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that patients with hypoxemia and COVID-19 have reduced ventilation compared with healthy control subjects. As part of a cross-sectional study of gas exchange in patients with early COVID-19 pneumonia on presentation to the hospital, we measured mean alveolar partial pressure of CO2 (PACO2), which represents the inverse of alveolar ventilation ( _ VA), and related it to the severity of hypoxemia as measured by PaO2. Published healthy subject data relating PACO2 to PaO2 under normoxic and acute hypoxic conditions (2–4) were used to assess whether _ VA levels of patients with COVID-19 were in the expected range for the severity of hypoxemia, thus inferring the ventilatory response of these patients.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b321f50d3e369ac57c8c8a6144f1b50d9309df1

We build on the ratio-of-ratios (RR) method and linear regression, an elegant approach resting on the Beer-Lambert law and landing itself to efficient smartphone implementations. However, its implementations without specialized hardware have so far proved to be unsuitable for clinical use, in particular due to the instability of the RR measurements. We use an empirical study to shed light on the reasons why and propose using the very RR measurements to filter RR measurements – a new paradigm we call the Meta-Region of interest (Meta-ROI). We design a complete-system architecture, including a novel data structure for storing and RR values in the time and space dimensions and an efficient algorithm for identifying Meta-ROI. Results from an Android implementation of SmartPhOx with the participation of 37 volunteers show that it is the first pure camera-and-flashlight solution to meet the FDA requirement for Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94b5ceb5c94cc00f1f4b47bc95578e802efef152

A pathological shift in the oxyhemoglobin curve (ODC) was previously described through the analysis of p50, intended as the oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is saturated by oxygen at 50%. The aim of this study was to analyze Hb-O2 affinity features over time in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients, through the analysis of ODC p50 behavior. A retrospective analysis was performed; through multiple arterial blood gas (ABG) analyses, each p50 was calculated and normalized according to PaCO2, pH and temperature; patients’ p50 evolution over time was reported, comparing the first 3 days (early p50s) with the last 3 days (late p50s) of ICU stay. A total of 3514 ABG analyses of 32 consecutive patients were analyzed. The majority of patients presented a left shift over time (p = 0.03). A difference between early p50s and late p50s was found (20.63 ± 2.1 vs. 18.68 ± 3.3 mmHg, p = 0.03); median p50 of deceased patients showed more right shifts than those of alive patients (24.1 vs. 18.45 mmHg, p = 0.01). One-way ANOVA revealed a p50 variance greater in the early p50s (σ2 = 8.6) than in the late p50s (σ2 = 3.84), associated with a reduction over time (p < 0.001). Comparing the Hb-O2 affinity in critically ill COVID-19 patients between ICU admission and ICU discharge, a temporal shift in the ODC was observed.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c4443b223e01efbe57a83baae56d0fdaa995259

Through in-depth qualitative interviews, we aimed to enrich our understanding of participants’ perspectives, with the hope of offering more holistic and appropriate care to future patients. Methods Participants who had survived critical COVID-19 illness (defined as a laboratory or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, with hypoxia requiring high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or mechanical ventilation) were invited to participate. After informed consent procedures, clinic-demographic details were documented and individual interviews conducted using a topic guide, and were audio-recorded, translated, transcribed and coded into NVivo software where themes were extracted. Results Of 21 participants (13 female, 8 male), the mean age was 51.8 years (range 34 - 68), and mean duration of COVID symptoms was 21.7 days (range 17 - 37). Eighteen participants had been on HFNO, and 5 required mechanical ventilation. The major themes were: distressing experience; faith-based beliefs sustaining them; gratitude to healthcare workers (HCWs); better understanding of COVID and how dangerous it is; optimism for the future; and a resolve to implement lifestyle changes. Conclusion Qualitative interviews revealed our participants’ experience of severe COVID-19 as a difficult and terrifying ordeal, mitigated by faith-based beliefs, and the presence and care of HCWs. These experiences were reported by the participants as life changing, and all were inspired to focus on future self-care, and invest in fulfilling relationships. These insights call for future interventions to improve patient-centred care, including follow-up debriefing sessions, and support for lifestyle changes.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d7d0e730fd00248d7e496e49c64370b87ec3aac

Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula>. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone’s camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7358ab8b5e4c58f5a73b4096914d94b407ed4c91

This retrospective study was aimed to assess the outcome of treatment with HFNC therapy in adult COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) admitted in intensive care units (ICU) and to assess the factors affecting outcome. Material and methods We retrieved electronic medical records of all COVID-19 patients who received HFNC for respiratory support after failure to maintain adequate oxygenation with conventional oxygen devices, between June 1 and August 31, 2020. The data retrieved were statistically analyzed. Results A total number of 558 COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICUs, out of which 139 patients were identified to be on HFNC and 85 met the inclusion criteria for the study. The success rate of 48.2% with HFNC was observed in these patients. The patients recorded to experience HFNC success were of young age and having higher baseline oxygen saturation compared to those who had its failure. The ROX indices post-initiation were observed to be significantly higher in the success group (p ≤0.001). Awake-prone positioning while receiving HFNC was followed by around more patients in the success group (p <0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline oxygen saturation, awake-prone positioning, and number of days on HFNC were found to be independently affected outcome with HFNC. Conclusion Almost half of the cases of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia can be managed successfully with HFNC, without the need of mechanical ventilation.

Objectives Our study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients undergoing early intubation compared to those undergoing late intubation. Methods This is a single-center retrospective study of adult COVID-19 patients admitted between March 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021. Early intubation was defined as intubation within 24 hours of a) hospital admission; b) respiratory status deterioration requiring FiO2 60% and higher; or c) moderate/severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis. Results Among the 128 COVID-19 patients included, 66.4% required early intubation, and 33.6% required late intubation. The 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration, hospital and ICU length of stay were equal regardless of intubation timing. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, COVID-19 therapies, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and pH were comparable for both groups. Better lung compliance was observed during early intubation than late intubation based on plateau (mean 21.3 vs. 25.5 cmH2O; P < 0.01) and peak pressure (mean 24.1 vs. 27.4 cmH2O; P = 0.04). Conclusions In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the timing of intubation was not significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes in the setting of matching clinical characteristics. More research is needed to determine which subset of patients may benefit from intubation and the predictors for optimal intubation timing.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78621ecc1543fee05793f972f8839bfb2224ec23

True among maintain build.;Poster;Purpose: We aimed to better understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in non-critically ill hospitalized patients secondarily presenting with clinical deterioration and increase in oxygen requirement without any identified worsening factors. Methods: We consecutively enrolled patients without clinical or biological evidence for superinfection, without left ventricular dysfunction and for whom a pulmonary embolism was discarded by computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography. We investigated lung ventilation and perfusion (LVP) by LVP scintigraphy, and, 24 h later, left and right ventricular function by Tc-99m-labeled albumin-gated blood-pool scintigraphy with late (60 mn) tomographic albumin images on the lungs to evaluate lung albumin retention that could indicate microvascular injuries with secondary edema. Results: We included 20 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All had CT evidence of organizing pneumonia and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. No patient demonstrated preserved ventilation with perfusion defect (mismatch), which may discard a distal lung thrombosis. Patterns of ventilation and perfusion were heterogeneous in seven patients (35%) with healthy lung segments presenting a relative paradoxical hypoperfusion and hypoventilation compared with segments with organizing pneumonia presenting a relative enhancement in perfusion and preserved ventilation. Lung albumin retention in area of organizing pneumonia was observed in 12 patients (60%), indicating microvascular injuries, increase in vessel permeability, and secondary edema. Conclusion: In hospitalized non-critically ill patients without evidence of superinfection, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac dysfunction, various types of damage may contribute to clinical deterioration including microvascular injuries and secondary edema, inconsistencies in lung segments vascularization suggesting a dysregulation of the balance in perfusion between segments affected by COVID-19 and others. Summary Statement Microvascular injuries and dysregulation of the balance in perfusion between segments affected by COVID-19 and others are present in non-critically ill patients without other known aggravating factors. Key Results In non-critically ill patients without evidence of superinfection, pulmonary embolism, macroscopic distal thrombosis or cardiac dysfunction, various types of damage may contribute to clinical deterioration including 1/ microvascular injuries and secondary edema, 2/ inconsistencies in lung segments vascularization with hypervascularization of consolidated segments contrasting with hypoperfusion of not affected segments, suggesting a dysregulation of the balance in perfusion between segments affected by COVID-19 and others.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2698192577c9103ced083d88200a7e41155dce8

The response to all these strategies, which include high nasal flow, continuous positive pressure, non-invasive ventilation, or even prone positioning in awake patients, can be highly variable depending on the predominant phenotypic involvement. Deciding when to replace conventional oxygen therapy with non-invasive respiratory support, which to choose, the role of combined methods, definitions, and attitudes toward treatment failure, and improved case improvement procedures are directly relevant clinical questions for the daily care of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

In addition to the impairment of taste and olfaction, the detection of the internal chemical environment may also be incapacitated by COVID-19. If this is the case, different consequences can be expected. (1) In some patients, hypoxia does not trigger distressing dyspnea (“silent” hypoxia): Long-term follow-up may determine whether silent hypoxia is related to malfunctioning of carotid body chemoreceptors. Moreover, taste/olfaction and oxygen chemoreceptors may be hit simultaneously: Testing olfaction, taste, and oxygen chemoreceptor functions in the early stages of COVID-19 allows one to unravel their connections and trace the recovery path. (2) Solitary chemosensory cells are also involved in the regulation of the innate mucosal immune response: If these cells are affected in some COVID-19 patients, the mucosal innate immune response would be dysregulated, opening one up to massive infection, thus explaining why COVID-19 has lethal consequences in some patients. Similar to taste and olfaction, oxygen chemosensory function can be easily tested with a non-invasive procedure in humans, while functional tests for solitary chemosensory or pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are not available, and autoptic investigation is required to ascertain their involvement.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3877e8817c2666375b987d20fa619ef442faf986

Air space community.;FullPaper;Objective Between 1 March and 15 June, France experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 29 549 deaths occurred among COVID-19 patients, 17 250 of whom died in hospital. Our hypothesis is that crude mortality rates are not sufficient to assess the impact of the epidemic on public health. The objective of this paper is to estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) of patients who died from COVID-19. Method We realised a retrospective analysis of the exhaustive sample of COVID-19 PCR-positive patients who died in public hospitals of Marseille during this first wave. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities and care pathways were collected from medical records. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to assess what would have been the probability of dying within 1 year of these patients in the absence of COVID-19 and to estimate total YLL. Results Among the 1631 patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19, 178 patients died, at an average age of 80 years. According to CCI, 88.8% of the deceased patients had an 85% probability of dying within 1 year before COVID-19. Among the 11.2% who had a lower CCI probability, 18 out of 20 had at least one additional comorbidity known to be a major risk factor of mortality in COVID-19 disease. Cumulative total number of YLL was estimated to be 541 in this deceased population, that is, an average of 3 YLL. Conclusion Although our results should be interpreted with caution, this analysis confirms that mortality due to COVID-19 translates into a limited number of YLL due to both old age and preexisting comorbidities in the most vulnerable patients. This fact should be better considered in public health management of the pandemic both for risk communication and design of the most appropriate protective measures.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5f7045da57ceb7e8baa5f4e2f2bca7b94fb3bfb

Our objective was to analyse safety and efficacy of HBO2 in treatment of hypoxaemia in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate time to hypoxaemia correction. Methods This was a multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between July and November 2020. Patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 ≤90% despite oxygen supplementation) were assigned to receive either HBO2 treatment or the standard treatment for respiratory symptoms for 7 days. HBO2 treatment was planned for ≥5 sessions (1 /day) for 90 min at 1.45 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Outcomes were time to normalise oxygen requirement to SpO2 ≥93%, need for mechanical respiratory assistance, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality within 30 days. A sample size of 80 patients was estimated, with a planned interim analysis after determining outcomes on 50% of patients. Results The trial was stopped after the interim analysis. 40 patients were randomised, 20 in each group, age was 55.2±9.2 years. At admission, frequent symptoms were dyspnoea, fever and odynophagia; SpO2 was 85.1%±4.3% for the whole group. Patients in the treatment group received an average of 6.2±1.2 HBO2 sessions. Time to correct hypoxaemia was shorter in treatment group versus control group; median 3 days (IQR 1.0–4.5) versus median 9 days (IQR 5.5–12.5), respectively (p<0.010). OR for recovery from hypoxaemia in the HBO2 group at day 3 compared with the control group was 23.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 329.6; p=0.001) Treatment had no statistically significant effect on acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days after admission. Conclusion Our findings support the safety and efficacy of HBO2 in the treatment of COVID-19 and severe hypoxaemia.

Image major mission want fill break cell.;ShortPaper;Abstract Introduction Prone positioning has been widely utilized in ARDS management before and during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its demonstrated mortality benefits. In pregnancy, proning requires careful attention to often overlooked physiologic changes in pregnancy and additional technical challenges accompanying a gravid abdomen. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a proning technique that was successfully used at our institution to avoid premature delivery of the fetus while improving maternal outcomes. All technical challenges are addressed in the instructional videos using a pregnant model with twin gestation at 32 weeks. Methods We reviewed all the patients’ charts with positive SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 until July 2020 and identified those who developed ARDS. Subsequently, we identified four patients that were proned during the antepartum period. We described their clinical course, including the change in ventilatory parameters in relationship with proning timing. Stepwise instructions for self-proning and proning in mechanically ventilated patients are illustrated in video format. Results During the study period, we identified 100 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanical ventilation was required in 8 of these patients. In four cases, proning was performed during the antepartum period. We were able to improve the P/F ratio while decreasing FiO2 and avoiding iatrogenic preterm delivery. Except for one case, where the patient self-extubated and required emergent delivery, all patients were successfully extubated, followed for prenatal care, and delivered for usual obstetric indications. Conclusion Proning remains a well-proven intervention in ARDS and should be considered in pregnant women when indicated. We recognize that proning might not be effective in all cases. However, proning positioning is an option to improve oxygenation in patients with severe hypoxemia when the next consideration is delivery of a premature infant or maternal cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ec37e77235a0ab9de94b445efe3c15fa4f76359

In 2015, 14% of over 55,000 hospital patients in the UK were using oxygen. 42% of patients received this supplemental oxygen without a valid prescription. Health care professionals are frequently uncertain about the relevance of hypoxemia and have low awareness about the risks of hyperoxemia. Numerous randomized controlled trials about targets of oxygen therapy have been published in recent years. A national guideline is urgently needed. Methods: A national S3 guideline was developed and published within the Program for National Disease Management Guidelines (AWMF) with participation of 10 medical associations. A literature search was performed until February 1, 2021, to answer 10 key questions. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) System (“The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence”) was used to classify types of studies in terms of validity. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for assessing the quality of evidence and for grading guideline recommendation, and a formal consensus-building process was performed. Results: The guideline includes 34 evidence-based recommendations about indications, prescription, monitoring and discontinuation of oxygen therapy in acute care. The main indication for O2 therapy is hypoxemia. In acute care both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia should be avoided. Hyperoxemia also seems to be associated with increased mortality, especially in patients with hypercapnia. The guideline provides recommended target oxygen saturation for acute medicine without differentiating between diagnoses. Target ranges for oxygen saturation are based depending on ventilation status risk for hypercapnia. The guideline provides an overview of available oxygen delivery systems and includes recommendations for their selection based on patient safety and comfort. Conclusion: This is the first national guideline on the use of oxygen in acute care. It addresses health care professionals using oxygen in acute out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5e758ac18c7d8eb652181ffebb65bd630bc42e8

However, the absence of respiratory symptoms may delay the start of NIRS. The aim of this study was to determine whether a simple bedside test such as single-breath counting test (SBCT) can predict the need for NIRS in the 24 h following the access to Emergency Department (ED). We performed a prospective observational study on 120 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. ROC curves were used to analyze factors which might predict NIRS requirement. We found that 36% of patients had normal respiratory rate and did not experience dyspnea at rest. 65% of study population required NIRS in the 24 h following the access to ED. NIRS-requiring group presented lower PaO2/FiO2 (235.09 vs. 299.02), SpO2/FiO2 ratio (357.83 vs. 431.07), PaCO2 (35.12 vs. 40.08), and SBCT (24.46 vs. 30.36) and showed higher incidence of dyspnea at rest (57.7% vs. 28.6%). Furthermore, SBCT predicted NIRS requirement even in the subgroup of patients without respiratory symptoms (AUC = 0.882, cut-off = 30). SBCT might be a valuable tool for bedside assessment of respiratory function in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and might be considered as an early clinical sign of impending respiratory deterioration.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b305c60a11b32e39b785c8009b36194666ab5625

In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. By crossing boundaries between the disciplines of biophysics and pathophysiology, we present evidence that WCR may: (1) cause morphologic changes in erythrocytes including echinocyte and rouleaux formation that can contribute to hypercoagulation; (2) impair microcirculation and reduce erythrocyte and hemoglobin levels exacerbating hypoxia; (3) amplify immune system dysfunction, including immunosuppression, autoimmunity, and hyperinflammation; (4) increase cellular oxidative stress and the production of free radicals resulting in vascular injury and organ damage; (5) increase intracellular Ca2+ essential for viral entry, replication, and release, in addition to promoting pro-inflammatory pathways; and (6) worsen heart arrhythmias and cardiac disorders. Relevance for Patients: In short, WCR has become a ubiquitous environmental stressor that we propose may have contributed to adverse health outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and increased the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we recommend that all people, particularly those suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduce their exposure to WCR as much as reasonably achievable until further research better clarifies the systemic health effects associated with chronic WCR exposure.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11ed28b5df0b780006a4da5039ddbb554b36119d

However, the stratification of patients at risk of mortality is not well defined. In this study, we aimed to define a mortality risk index to allocate patients to the appropriate intensity of care. Methods: This is a 12 months observational longitudinal study designed to develop and validate a pragmatic mortality risk score to stratify COVID-19 patients aged ≥18 years and admitted to hospital between March 2020 and March 2021. Main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: 244 patients were included in the study (mortality rate 29.9%). The Covid-19 Assessment for Survival at Admission (CASA) index included seven variables readily available at admission: respiratory rate, troponin, albumin, CKD-EPI, white blood cell count, D-dimer, Pa02/Fi02. The CASA index showed high discrimination for mortality with an AUC of 0.91 (sensitivity 98.6%; specificity 69%) and a better performance compared to SOFA (AUC = 0.76), age (AUC = 0.76) and 4C mortality (AUC = 0.82). The cut-off identified (11.994) for CASA index showed a negative predictive value of 99.16% and a positive predictive value of 57.58%. Conclusions: A quick and readily available index has been identified to help clinicians stratify COVID-19 patients according to the appropriate intensity of care and minimize hospital admission to patients at high risk of mortality.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/092302fb3de5f6bf062843386d4c13fff1764db7

Participant career food girl instead.;Poster;Neonatal survival requires precise control of breathing and cardiovascular action, with fatal consequences or severe injury without support. Prematurity presents multiple opportunities to disrupt cardiorespiratory regulation, leading to expressions of apnea of prematurity, periodic breathing, and inappropriate cardiovascular responses to apnea. Failed breathing control can result from altered breathing drives, typically arising from untimely development of sensory or motor coordination processes. Some drives, such as temperature, are a special concern in neonates with low body mass, enhancing susceptibility to rapid body cooling. Chemical drives, such as pH or CO2 or O2, may be inadequately developed; in some conditions, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), breathing responses to CO2 or low O2 may be reduced or absent, and coupling of cardiovascular responses to breathing changes are abolished. Sleep states exert profound influences on both chemical and temperature drives, with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep potentially modifying descending temperature influences, and state transitions significantly altering respiratory responses to chemical stimuli. In addition, neonates spend the majority of time in REM sleep, a state which induces a generalized inhibition of skeletal muscle activity that abolishes muscle tone to upper airway and thoracic wall muscles, enhancing the likelihood for obstructive sleep apnea. Although disrupted regulatory drives can often be replaced by positive (or negative) pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure or enhanced by manipulating neurotransmitter action via caffeine, those approaches may exert negative consequences in the long term; the lungs of neonates, especially premature infants, are fragile, and easily injured by positive pressure. The consequences of caffeine use, acting directly on neural receptors, although seemingly innocuous in the near-term, may have long-term concerns and disrupts the integrity of sleep. The developmental breathing field needs improved means to support ventilation when one or more drives to respiration fail, and when the cardiovascular system, depending heavily on interactions with breathing, is compromised. Neuromodulatory procedures which manipulate the vestibular system to stabilize breathing or use tactile or proprioceptive stimuli to activate long-established reflexive mechanisms coupling limb movement with respiratory efforts can provide support for central and obstructive apnea, as well as for periodic breathing and cardiovascular action, particularly during sleep.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b1905728889c3dea6340adaad01a9aa48dcc718

Objective: Our meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical characteristics between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors requiring ECMO support. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed between December first, 2019, to June first, 2021. Studies with comparative data of COVID-19 ECMO patients were selected, in which clinical characteristics and complications were assessed. Results: Sixteen cohort studies involving 706 COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support with pooled mortality rate of 40% were included. Younger age (mean 51 years vs 55 years; P < .001), fewer comorbidities (23% vs 31%; odds ratio [OR] 0.55; P  =  .02), and less renal replacement therapy (RRT) (21% vs 39%; OR 0.41; P  =  .007) and vasopressor (76% vs 92%; OR 0.35; P  =  .008) requirement were demonstrated in COVID-19 survivors requiring ECMO support than nonsurvivors. Survivors also had higher pre-ECMO pH (mean 7.33 vs 7.26; P < .001) than nonsurvivors. No difference was observed in gender, body mass index, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) before ECMO support initiation, total ECMO support duration, and pre-ECMO parameters of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, tidal volume (mL/kg), positive end-expiratory pressure, and plateau pressure. The rate of bleeding complications was lower in survivors (32% vs 59%; OR 0.36; P  =  .001) than nonsurvivors, but no difference was observed in thromboembolism and secondary infections. Conclusions: We found advanced age, multiple comorbidities, lower pre-ECMO pH, greater RRT, and vasopressor requirements, and bleeding are predictors of death in COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support. The duration of MV before ECMO support initiation and total ECMO support duration was similar among survivors and nonsurvivors.

Indicate hot floor audience ten.;Poster;Early in the pandemic era of COVID-19 the term “happy or silent hypoxia” was introduced to describe patients with COVID-19 who presented with severe hypoxemia and absence of dyspnea (Couzin-Frankel, 2020; Guan et al., 2020). The absence of dyspnea despite severe hypoxemia was considered to be a “paradox” and unique to COVID-19 (Archer et al., 2020; Ferenchick and Ferenchick, 2020). As such the term “happy or silent hypoxia” has been received wide attention by the press and social media and even described as a silent killer in COVID-19 (Levitan, 2020). Although scientific evidence is lacking, central nervous system viral invasion has been put forward to explain this “paradox” (Nouri-Vaskeh et al., 2020; Gopal et al., 2021; Tavčar et al., 2021). Nevertheless, basic principles of respiratory system physiology dictate that the absence of dyspnea despite severe hypoxemia is not specifically linked to COVID-19 but to other lung diseases as well (Tobin et al., 2020). The aim of our article is to present information about the responses to both acute and sustained hypoxia and provide an analysis of control of breathing physiology that could explain the absence of dyspnea despite severe hypoxemia. Specifically, we apply in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 our currently published analysis (Vaporidi et al., 2020) that relates arterial carbon dioxide levels with respiratory centers response to this stimulus, contrasting the brain’s responses to the patient’s ability to generate effective alveolar ventilation. This analysis may facilitate comprehension of the pathophysiology of dyspnea in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67e4f88b9c8ffb3276de4dd49bda32d027e4bec1

Mouth read foot animal general five.;Poster;Abundant evidence strongly suggests that the condition of pregnancy makes women and their fetuses highly vulnerable to severe Corona-virus 2019 (COVID-19) complications. Here, two novel hypoxia-related conditions are proposed to play a pivotal role in better understanding the relationship between COVID-19, pregnancy and poor health outcomes. The first condition, “misattributed dyspnea (shortness of breath)” refers to respiratory symptoms common to both advanced pregnancy and COVID-19, which are mistakenly perceived as related to the former rather than to the latter; as a result, pregnant women with this condition receive no medical attention until the disease is in an advanced stage. The second condition, “silent hypoxia”, refers to abnormally low blood oxygen saturation levels in COVID-19 patients, which occur in the absence of typical respiratory distress symptoms, such as dyspnea, thereby also leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. The delay in diagnosis and referral to treatment, due to either “misattributed dypsnea” or “silent hypoxia”, may lead to rapid deterioration and poor health outcome to both the mothers and their fetuses. This is particularly valid among women during advanced stages of pregnancy as the altered respiratory features make the consequences of the disease more challenging to cope with. Studies have demonstrated the importance of monitoring blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry as a reliable predictor of disease severity and outcome among COVID-19 patients. We propose the use of home pulse oximetry during pregnancy as a diagnostic measure that, together with proper medical guidance, may allow early diagnosis of hypoxia and better health outcomes.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/789f020d2cfcae56d60f22c7020dd80da7f59984

D-dimer, a fairly decisive marker for the coagulopathy event, is physiologically a marker of the fibrinolysis process. The increase of D-dimers in COVID-19 cases must be followed up because it relates to the initiation of a cytokine storm. Case presentation: We report an asymptomatic patient with sudden D-dimer elevation who received anticoagulant therapy. After three days of heparin administration, D-dimer results became normal and anticoagulant therapy was stopped. However, on the 12th day, the D-dimer level rebounded back and was followed by an increase of hs-C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, although SARS-CoV-2 PCR result became negative. A hyperglycaemic reaction and a sudden increase of HbA1C was observed in the patient. After three weeks D-dimer had returned to normal levels, and so did the other markers. The patient recovered fully and still no symptoms were obvious. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients without symptoms may be at risk of an asymptomatic coagulopathy process. The decreasing level of D-dimer erroneously cannot ensure that the coagulopathy process stops.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f380f97308a71534a00e71e164a3cca9f2557013

Nearly half of intubated patients with COVID-19 eventually die. High-Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) and Noninvasive Ventilation (NIV) constitute valuable tools to avert endotracheal intubation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who do not respond to conventional oxygen treatment. Sparing Intensive Care Unit beds and reducing intubation-related complications may save lives in the pandemic era. The main drawback of HFNO and/or NIV is intubation delay. Cautious selection of patients with severe hypoxemia due to COVID-19 disease, close monitoring and appropriate employment and titration of HFNO and/or NIV can increase the rate of success and eliminate the risk of intubation delay. At the same time, all precautions to protect the healthcare personnel from viral transmission should be taken. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the application of HFNO and NIV in severe COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure, analyse the risks associated with their use and provide a path for their proper implementation.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b24fe2a7bb152f971cf8a7dfe2139aaf7fe6c76

Point recognize generation apply exist maybe door., Fly matter investment forward produce where.;ShortPaper;TO THE EDITOR: We have read with great interest the paper authored by Barreto-Filho et al. (1), “Nondyspnogenic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 pneumonia.” Although the notion of blunted respiratory sensation in patients with COVID-19 has already been disputed (2), the authors developed in their viewpoint a physiological case to support the view that SARS-COV virus can decrease the capacity of infected patients to “feel” the effects of their viral pneumonia, leading to “nondyspnogenic hypoxemic respiratory failure.” Based on the evidence and the rationale presented in the paper, we fear that this article may contribute to more “myth-building” around this newly discovered disease. As briefly developed in our letter, the authors are excessively using the “argument from analogy” while making their case, without really bringing evidence of the existence of such a syndrome. They also seem to have disregarded the complex anatomical basis of dyspnea generation, which relies on widespread structures, making an isolated alteration of dyspnea—identical in many of these patients—difficult to conceive, not to mention the common observation of very severe asynchrony in patients with COVID when mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume strategies. Finally, no data obtained from a systematic study of breathing sensations in these patients, against adequate control groups, are presented. It is intriguing that the authors first acknowledged the fact that isolated acute hypoxemia at the level observed in these patients (who do receive oxygen supplement and typically remain with SaO2 > 88%) is unlikely to produce significant dyspnea, rendering obsolete the need to discuss the notion of “nondyspnogenesis,” as previously argued by Tobin et al. (2). Perhaps as importantly, unless a patient has underlying lung disease, COVID-19 viral infection does not cause hypercarbia or alteration in respiratory mechanics, during mild forms ofmultifocal pneumonia, that would be severe enough to produce major breathing sensation, at least at rest. Yet, the authors are trying to describe the possible physiological basis for a nondyspnogenic acute hypoxemic respiratory in COVD-19 pneumonia, an entity that they are not even sure is real. Equating the capacity of this virus to invade neurons, both experimentally and clinically, with an alteration in dyspnea sensation (1) is certainly a big leap in reasoning. Simply stated, the sensation of dyspnea can be understood as resulting from the collection of peripheral sensing inputs processed centrally in the brainstem, increasing in turn the neural output to the respiratory muscles while sending a “copy” of this information toward the thalamus, the limbic system, and the sensorimotor cortex, where the sensation becomes “conscious” (3–5). Therefore, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to imagine lesions of the central nervous system exclusively affecting breathing sensations to be systematically present in a large proportion of patients with COVID19 without alteration in any other sensory ormotor functions that are processed in the same areas. For instance, the authors reference literature on the role of the vagal and glossopharyngeal nerves in the ventilatory response and breathing discomfort during hypercapnia. True as this may be, it does not address the core argument of why and how COVID19 should be presenting with a reduced sensation of dyspnea. If cranial nerves were affected, we should expect patients to have deficits in the functions of these nerves that would manifest as changes in gastrointestinal motility, cardiac response, gag reflex, etc. Furthermore, if the virus was to affect deeper brain structures, such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or more extensively the dorsal or ventral medulla, which may indeed affect the responses to hypoxia and respiratory sensations, such lesions would not account for an isolated decrease in shortness of breath. Indeed, when limited and unilateral defects are affecting the rostral medulla, abnormal symptoms ranging from hypoventilation during sleep and reduced CO2 sensitivity to severe respiratory and cardiovascular control abnormalities are present (6, 7), whereas bilateral or more widespread lesions are usually lethal (8). These changes are not reliably observed in patients with COVID-19, who typically do not experience hypercapnia or certainly not severe respiratory and cardiovascular control abnormalities. The same reasoning can be applied to more rostral structure, including the thalamus, the limbic, or the sensory cortex (wherein painful sensations are also encoded) (9). We concede that the generation of dyspnea could be altered in patients with COVID-19 in coma with diffuse encephalitis; however, most patients who present with hypoxemic pneumonia have no neurological symptoms that would be compatible with the diagnosis of diffuse encephalitis. Finally, most clinicians caring for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 will have observed striking phenomena of asynchrony.

Citizen knowledge front area.;ShortPaper;Background The COVID-19 pandemic has presented emergency medical services (EMS) worldwide with the difficult task of identifying patients with COVID-19 and predicting the severity of their illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological respiratory parameters in pre-hospital patients with COVID-19 differed from those without COVID-19 and if they could be used to aid EMS personnel in the prediction of illness severity. Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 were included by EMS personnel in Uppsala, Sweden. A portable respiratory monitor based on pneumotachography was used to sample the included patient’s physiological respiratory parameters. A questionnaire with information about present symptoms and background data was completed. COVID-19 diagnoses and hospital admissions were gathered from the electronic medical record system. The physiological respiratory parameters of patients with and without COVID-19 were then analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression. Results Between May 2020 and January 2021, 95 patients were included, and their physiological respiratory parameters analyzed. Of these patients, 53 had COVID-19. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of having COVID-19 increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.000–1.118), tidal volume (95% CI 0.996–0.999) and negative inspiratory pressure (95% CI 1.017–1.152). Patients admitted to hospital had higher respiratory rates (p<0.001) and lower tidal volume (p = 0.010) compared to the patients who were not admitted. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of hospital admission increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.081–1.324), rapid shallow breathing index (95% CI 1.006–1.040) and dead space percentage of tidal volume (95% CI 1.027–1.159). Conclusion Patients taking smaller, faster breaths with less pressure had higher odds of having COVID-19 in this study. Smaller, faster breaths and higher dead space percentage also increased the odds of hospital admission. Physiological respiratory parameters could be a useful tool in detecting COVID-19 and predicting hospital admissions, although more research is needed.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30bab5101601d8fd1037fa2728c1f17fa4969c2b

It has increased hospital occupancy, heralded economic turmoil, and the rapid transmission and community spread have added to the burden of the virus. Most of the patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure often secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Based on the limited data available, there have been different opinions about the respiratory mechanics of the ARDS caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our article provides an insight into COVID-19 pathophysiology and how it differs from typical ARDS. Based on these differences, our article explains the different approach to ventilation in COVID-19 ARDS compared to typical ARDS. We critically analyze the role of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and proning in the ICU patients. Through the limited data and clinical experience are available, we believe that early proning in COVID-19 patients improves oxygenation and optimal PEEP should be titrated based on individual lung compliance.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb810f670b9bc656a9877061d52cb9fccad05c0

Value think story purpose floor.;ShortPaper;OBJECTIVES: Owing to the fact that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an underreported disease, the strategy used for the diagnosis of OSA has been extensively dissected to devise a simplified process that can be accessed by the public health services. Polysomnography (PSG) type I, the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA, is expensive and difficult to access by low-income populations. In this study, we aimed to verify the accuracy of the oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) in comparison to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) using a portable monitor. METHODS: We evaluated 94 type III PSG home test results of 65 elderly patients (69.21±6.94 years old), along with information, such as the body mass index (BMI) and sex, using data obtained from a clinical trial database. RESULTS: A significant linear positive correlation (r=0.93, p<0.05) was observed between ODI and AHI, without any interference from sex, BMI, and positional component. The sensitivity of ODI compared to that of AHI increased with an increase in the severity of OSA, while the specificity of ODI in comparison to that of AHI was high for all degrees of severity. The accuracy of ODI was 80.7% for distinguishing between patients with mild and moderate apnea and 84.4% for distinguishing between patients with moderate and severe apnea. CONCLUSION: The ODI values obtained in uncontrolled conditions exhibited high sensitivity for identifying severe apnea compared to the AHI values, and correctly identified the severity of OSA in more than 80% of the cases. Thus, oximetry is promising strategy for diagnosing OSA.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c94ab1e58f54c6eb6bed305d04a7cec9ec9cfc00

The impact of the viral infection on blood oxygenation and other elements of oxygen homeostasis, such as oxygen sensing and respiratory mitochondrial mechanisms, are not well understood. As a step toward understanding these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19, recent experiments revealed contradictory data on the impact of COVID-19 infection on red blood cells (RBCs) oxygenation parameters. However, structural protein damage and membrane lipid remodeling in RBCs from COVID-19 patients that may impact RBC function have been reported. Moreover, COVID-19 infection could potentially disrupt one, if not all, of the other major pathways of homeostasis.

The objective of this paper was to analyze the prognostic ability of the pulse oximetry saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) and the ratio of SpO2/FiO2 to the respiratory rate–ROX index–as predictors of IMV in an emergency department in confirmed COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was carried out in four provinces of Spain between March and November 2020. The discriminative power of the predictive variable was assessed through a prediction model trained using a derivation sub-cohort and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) on the validation sub-cohort. A total of 2040 patients were included in the study. The IMV rate was 10.1%, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 35.3%. The performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was better than the ROX index–AUC = 0.801 (95% CI 0.746–0.855) and AUC = 0.725 (95% CI 0.652–0.798), respectively. In fact, a direct comparison between AUCs resulted in significant differences (p = 0.001). SpO2 to FiO2 ratio is a simple and promising non-invasive tool for predicting risk of IMV in patients infected with COVID-19, and it is realizable in emergency departments.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/809bf9cb6b4cb7e91f234643fcc99d22b6fd7fad

Interview respond city area.;DemoPaper;SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which binds to the S1 spike protein on the surface of the virus. To delineate the impact of S1 spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, we incubated the S1 spike protein with human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAEC). HPAEC treatment with the S1 spike protein caused disruption of endothelial barrier function, increased levels of numerous inflammatory molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-1β, CCL5, CXCL10), elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a mild rise in glycolytic reserve capacity. Because low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is associated with severe cases of COVID-19, we also evaluated treatment with hemoglobin (HbA) as a potential countermeasure in hypoxic and normal oxygen environments in analyses with the S1 spike protein. We found hypoxia downregulated the expression of the ACE2 receptor and increased the critical oxygen homeostatic signaling protein, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α); however, treatment of the cells with HbA yielded no apparent change in the levels of ACE2 or HIF-1α. Use of quantitative proteomics revealed that S1 spike protein-treated cells have few differentially regulated proteins in hypoxic conditions, consistent with the finding that ACE2 serves as the host viral receptor and is reduced in hypoxia. However, in normoxic conditions, we found perturbed abundance of proteins in signaling pathways related to lysosomes, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and pyrimidine metabolism. We conclude that the spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in HPAEC, and that treatment with HbA failed to reverse the vast majority of these spike protein-induced changes.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2530bf6d3eb7f205d54419ace6b8f1f78bed1d5

Once patients require mechanical ventilation (MV), the temporal change in gas exchange and its relation to clinical outcome is poorly described. We investigated whether gas exchange over the first 5 days of MV is associated with mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days in COVID-19. Methods: In a cohort of 294 COVID-19 patients, we used data during the first 5 days of MV to calculate 4 daily respiratory scores: PaO2/FiO2 (P/F), oxygenation index (OI), ventilatory ratio (VR), and Murray lung injury score. The association between these scores at early (days 1-3) and late (days 4-5) time points with mortality was evaluated using logistic regression, adjusted for demographics. Correlation with ventilator-free days was assessed (Spearman rank-order coefficients). Results: Overall mortality was 47.6%. Nonsurvivors were older (P < .0001), more male (P = .029), with more preexisting cardiopulmonary disease compared to survivors. Mean PaO2 and PaCO2 were similar during this timeframe. However, by days 4 to 5 values for all airway pressures and FiO2 had diverged, trending lower in survivors and higher in nonsurvivors. The most substantial between-group difference was the temporal change in OI, improving 15% in survivors and worsening 11% in nonsurvivors (P < .05). The adjusted mortality OR was significant for age (1.819, P = .001), OI at days 4 to 5 (2.26, P = .002), and OI percent change (1.90, P = .02). The number of ventilator-free days correlated significantly with late VR (−0.166, P < .05), early and late OI (−0.216, P < .01; −0.278, P < .01, respectively) and early and late P/F (0.158, P < .05; 0.283, P < .01, respectively). Conclusion: Nonsurvivors of COVID-19 needed increasing intensity of MV to sustain gas exchange over the first 5 days, unlike survivors. Temporal change OI, reflecting both PaO2 and the intensity of MV, is a potential marker of outcome in respiratory failure due to COVID-19.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d7737b8e39a2ca8818c12f5e1813ad82d9af6d5

Oxygen pinching reduced oxygen use by 51% to 64%, maintained simulated oxygen saturation between 88% and 90%, and increased simulated average alveolar partial pressure of oxygen from a room air baseline of approximately 131 to 294–424 mm Hg compared with 607 mm Hg with 10 liters per minute (LPM) continuous oxygen flow.

Cold two doctor former.;FullPaper;The axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) pass through the optic nerve head (ONH) and form the optic nerve (ON). The ONH serves as an anatomical interface between the vitreous cavity and subarachnoid space. After inducing acute neuroinflammation by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we observed inflammatory activation in the retina, but detect no signs of inflammation in the posterior ON or infiltration of inflammatory cells in the ONH. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ONH functions as a barrier to vitreous inflammation. Using transmission electron microscopy, we identified significant increase in G-ratio in the posterior ON on day 7 post intravitreal injection (PII) of LPS compared with the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group. Moreover, using confocal imaging of ex vivo tissue extracted from Aldh1L1-eGFP reporter mice, we observed that the ONH astrocytes altered their spatial orientation by elongating their morphology along the axonal axis of RGCs in LPS- versus PBS-treated eyes; this was quantified by the ratio of longitudinal (DL) and transverse (DT) diameter of astrocytes and the proportion of longitudinally locating astrocytes. Supportive evidences were further provided by transmission electron microscopic imaging in rat ONH. We further conducted RNA sequencing of ONH on day 1 PII and found LPS induced clear upregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that astrocyte and microglia contributed prominently to the transcriptomic alterations in ONH. Here, we report that the vitreous infectious insults induce morphological changes of ONH astrocytes and transcriptomic alterations in the ONH. Glial responses in the ONH may defend against vitreous infectious insults and serve as a barrier to inflammation for the central nervous system.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553f9664b82a7b14f1b8b05e079106e6f3dc1bcd

Form front would media.;ShortPaper;Orbital implant materials have evolved greatly over the past century and include but are not limited to metal, ceramic, polymer, silicone, and glass. Knowledge of historically used materials is clinically relevant to patient care as certain materials carry a greater risk of migration, extrusion, infection, and limitations for imaging modalities utilized to visualize adjacent structures. We report an unusual case of an 80-year-old male who presented to our community hospital with seizure-like activity. CT imaging of the brain revealed several white matter and cortex lesions with the largest lesion measuring 2.5 × 2 × 1.9 cm. The patient had a history of enucleation with placement of an orbital implant following a penetrating injury to the left eye at four years of age. Hounsfield scale analysis was read by radiology as being most consistent with a thin metallic shell surrounding the orbital implant. The potential for metallic material was consistent with the implant’s age and time of placement. Few reviews on ocular implant materials from this period exist in the current medical literature. A single case report discussing a hollow metal orbital implant with similar-appearing imaging was identified. Due to concern for possible metal implant materials, the patient underwent implant exchange so MRI imaging could safely be performed. Intraoperatively, the implant was identified as a clear, hollow, non-metallic, non-porous polymer sphere. Following surgery, the patient was able to undergo appropriate neuroimaging with subsequent diagnostic biopsy. Current literature reviewing CT or photographic imaging of ocular implant devices prior to the 1940s is limited. This case highlights the importance of detailing materials historically used in orbital implants, their effects on clinical decision-making, and the utility of Hounsfield scale values to identify a material’s radiodensity on CT imaging.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/435743905e1a95e28578c7d2c4ef9ea49d116be3

The increased pressure and oxygen bioavailability might be related to a plethora of applications, particularly in hypoxic regions, also exerting antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and angiogenic properties, among others. In this review, we will discuss in detail the physiological relevance of oxygen and the therapeutical basis of HBOT, collecting current indications and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, potential areas of research will also be examined, including inflammatory and systemic maladies, COVID-19 and cancer. Finally, the adverse effects and contraindications associated with this therapy and future directions of research will be considered. Overall, we encourage further research in this field to extend the possible uses of this procedure.

From social distancing to oxygen stress, organisms have been tackling pandemic‐related problems for millions of years. What can we learn from such diverse adaptations in our own applications? This review uses a seminar course on the COVID‐19 crisis to illustrate bioinspiration as an approach to teaching biology content. At the start of the class, students mind‐mapped the entire problem; this range of subproblems was used to structure the biology content throughout the entire class. Students came to individual classes with a brainstormed list of biological systems that could serve as inspiration for a particular problem (e.g., absorptive leaves in response to the problem of toilet paper shortages). After exploration of relevant biology content, discussion returned to the focal problem. Students dug deeper into the literature in a group project on mask design and biological systems relevant to filtration and transparency. This class structure was an engaging way for students to learn principles from ecology, evolution, behavior, and physiology. Challenges with this course design revolved around the interdisciplinary and creative nature of the structure; for instance, the knowledge of the participants was often stretched by engineering details. While the present class was focused on the COVID‐19 crisis, a course structured through a bioinspired approach can be applied to other focal problems, or subject areas, giving instructors a powerful method to deliver interdisciplinary content in an integrated and inquiry‐driven way.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e665481f7c409321a8bb5f11331cbf6c83fe5f61

A brief review of literature was undertaken to inform development of a protocol describing the indications and process of prone positioning to aid the management of COVID-19 infection in non-mechanically ventilated, awake older adults. PubMed was searched up to 14th January 2021 to identify English language papers that described prone positioning procedures used in non-mechanically ventilated patients. Data were pooled to inform the development of a prone positioning protocol for use in hospital ward environments. The protocol was trialled and refined during routine clinical practice. Screening of 146 articles yielded five studies detailing a prone positioning protocol. Prone positioning is a potentially feasible and tolerated treatment adjunct for hypoxaemia in older adults with COVID-19.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of 542 patients who underwent eviscerations, enucleations and secondary procedures by one surgeon (Dr. James Oestreicher) was completed, paying special attention to complications in the follow-up period prior to pegging, as well as those that occurred post-pegging. Results: Approximately 60% of patients experienced complications prior to implant drilling, with discharge being the most prevalent (15.9%). Secondary procedures were associated with significantly greater complication rates prior to implant drilling. Silicone implants had significantly less pre-pegging pyogenic granuloma (P = 0.011) and hypo-ophthalmos (P = 0.042) than the other implant types. Seven implants had to be removed due to exposure. Implant drilling and peg placement were performed in 275 patients. Implant drilling complications were experienced by 67.4% of pegged patients, with a change in discharge from prior to pegging (27.2%) being the most prevalent. Plastic peg systems had a significantly higher incidence of complications than titanium systems. Conclusions: The majority of orbital implantations involve complications, these being largely minor ones which resolve spontaneously or are easily treated. Secondary implant procedures involve a higher likelihood of complications. Silicone implants have the smallest amount of complications. Should patients decide to undergo pegging, evidence sides strongly for the use of a titanium peg and sleeve system over the other peg types.

Experience everybody well. Research herself think some camera.;ShortPaper;Background: Hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 is one of the strongest predictors of mortality. Silent hypoxia is characterised by the presence of hypoxia without dyspnoea. Silent hypoxia has been shown to affect the outcome in previous studies. Methods: This was a retrospective study of a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hypoxic at presentation. Clinical, laboratory and treatment parameters in patients with silent hypoxia and dyspnoeic hypoxia were compared. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the factors predicting mortality. Results: Among 2080 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, 811 patients were hypoxic with SpO2 <94% at the time of presentation. Among them, 174 (21.45%) did not have dyspnoea since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, 5.2% of patients were completely asymptomatic for COVID-19 and were found to be hypoxic only on pulse oximetry. The case fatality rate in patients with silent hypoxia was 45.4% as compared to 40.03% in dyspnoeic hypoxic patients (P = 0.202). The odds ratio of death was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.41–2.97) in the patients with silent hypoxia after adjusting for baseline characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment and in-hospital complications, which did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.851). Conclusion: Silent hypoxia may be the only presenting feature of COVID-19. As the case fatality rate is comparable between silent and dyspnoeic hypoxia, it should be recognised early and treated as aggressively. Because home isolation is recommended in patients with COVID-19, it is essential to use pulse oximetry in the home setting to identify these patients.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5bbf164196f6c76c470567e0ca59c1943ae2ac7

METHODS: Case series. Analysis of the clinical charts of 25 patients (age 5 to 62 years) who were submitted to explantation of exposed hydroxyapatite orbital implants, followed by simultaneous replacement with a dermis-fat graft by 1 oculoplastic surgeon between 2000 and 2011. A histopathological and microbiological evaluation of implant sections was performed. This study adheres to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS: Microbiological examination showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci infection in 59% of the patients. Histopathological examination showed the presence of a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in 22 of the implants (88%) and significantly reduced fibrovascular colonization of the implant in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of fibrovascular ingrowth resulted in poor integration of the implant in the eye socket. The exposure allowed bacterial colonization of the implant, causing a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. A dermis-fat graft at the same time of explantation can be considered a suitable surgical option in both adults and children: only minor complications may occur, and cosmetic results are satisfactory.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d04532a666defa12c3bdcb53ca0d63a241345075

To evaluate clinically and histologically the safety and biocompatibility of a new HDPE-based spherical porous orbital implants in rabbits. Methods. MEDPOR (Porex Surgical, Inc., Fairburn, GA, USA), OCULFIT I, and OCULFIT II (AJL Ophthalmic S.A., Vitoria, Spain) implants were implanted in eviscerated rabbis. Animals were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 4 each) according to the 3 implant materials tested and 2 follow-up times of 90 or 180 days. Signs of regional pain and presence of eyelid swelling, conjunctival hyperemia, and amount of exudate were semiquantitatively evaluated. After animals sacrifice, the implants and surrounding ocular tissues were processed for histological staining and polarized light evaluation. Statistical study was performed by ANOVA and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results. No statistically significant differences in regional pain, eyelid swelling, or conjunctival hyperemia were shown between implants and/or time points evaluated. However, amount of exudate differed, with OCULFIT I causing the smallest amount. No remarkable clinical complications were observed. Histological findings were similar in all three types of implants and agree with minor inflammatory response. Conclusions.

Methods Retrospective case series. From 1994 to 2015, 256 patients who received primary implantation after enucleation or evisceration and were followed up for an average of 108.9 months were recruited. Detailed characteristics of patients, including previous surgery or trauma, surgical indications and methods, pegging procedure, and implant types were collected. The long-term outcomes were recorded. For patients with extensive implant exposure (diameter of tissue defect >2 cm), implant removal and dermis fat graft were performed. Results The risk factors for implant exposure included eviscerated globes and pegged implants. The exposure rates were higher (24.7% in hydroxyapatite (HA), 23.5% in bioceramic and 76.5% in Medpor) as compared with those in previous reports. The average times to exposure were 67.4 months in HA, 52.5 months in bioceramic and 73.4 months in Medpor implants. Among the cases with implant exposure, late exposure (>2 years after operation) accounted for 67% of cases. Thirty eyes with large-area exposure were managed with dermis fat grafts. Twenty-four cases were successfully treated with single surgery. The other six cases developed fornix loss and required additional reconstruction with full thickness skin graft. Conclusions Late exposures of porous orbital implants were noted during long-term follow-up. The causes of implant exposure may be associated with pegging procedures and evisceration. The implantation of dermis fat can be an effective procedure for the management of large-area implant exposure.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e6054413639b605f9c2d13936f2e8211ae15d0a3

Hour simple natural central sea truth technology.;Poster;BACKGROUND, Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment., , , OBJECTIVES, To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets., , , SEARCH METHODS, We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data., , , MAIN RESULTS, We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias.One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data.In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI -4.08 to -2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events.In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence).None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bacc98b84eac8de896d977fb426add2076d4e9f9

Charts were found by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Demographics, surgical indication, procedure, implant, antibiotic use, and postoperative course were recorded. SSIs occurring within 30 days after surgery were reviewed and postoperative infection rates were determined., , , RESULTS, Four hundred eighty-one cases from January 1999 to December 2015 were analyzed. There were 102 eviscerations with implants, 314 enucleations with implants, 23 enucleations without implants, 23 implant exchanges, 15 implants placed secondarily after enucleation, and 4 implant removals. Seventy cases (14.6%) were given perioperative IV antibiotics, and in this group one periorbital infection occurred unrelated to orbital surgery (1.4%). Of the 411 cases (85.4%) not given perioperative IV antibiotics, 1 of 87 eviscerations with implants developed an SSI (1.1%), 2 of 273 enucleations with implants developed SSIs (0.7%), and none of the 13 enucleations without implants developed SSIs., , , CONCLUSIONS, To our knowledge, this is the first published case series reporting SSI rates of enucleations and eviscerations with implants performed without perioperative IV antibiotics or postoperative oral antibiotics. With infection rates comparing favorably to other case series where antibiotics were given, the routine use of perioperative IV antibiotics and postoperative oral antibiotics for enucleations and eviscerations may not be indicated.;Yes;No;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f3dd4b4df55121844fc4292669706136606f14b

Methods This was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study, in which demographic and clinical data were compiled by reviewing the clinical records of anophthalmic patients with implant exposure treated with an autogenous retroauricular myoperiosteal graft at the Instituto de Microcirugía Ocular (IMO, Barcelona, Spain) over the period January 2007 to December 2017. Main outcome was the long-term coverage of implant after retroauricular myoperiosteal autograft; secondary outcome was the rate of post-surgical complications and management. Results Over the 11-year period, 27 eyes of 27 patients with implant exposure received a retroauricular myoperiosteal autograft. Mean participant age was 47.3 ± 17.9 years (range 9–78, median 45). Primary surgery was enucleation in 8 eyes (29.6%) and evisceration in 19 (70.4%). Implant materials were porous polyethylene in 17 (63%), hydroxyapatite in 3 (11.1%), and bioceramics in 4 (14.8%). In the remaining three patients (11.1%), the implant material and size were unknown. Implant exposure was diagnosed after a mean of 98 ± 111.7 months. Mean exposure diameter was 5.9 ± 3.1 mm. Mean follow-up duration after graft surgery was 37.5 ± 39 months. In four patients (14.8%), implant re-exposure was recorded and in two of these patients a re-graft using the same technique was performed. In the last follow-up session, all patients showed good implant coverage. Conclusions Myoperiosteal graft could be a valid option for the long-term management of implant exposure irrespective of primary surgery, exposed area, and implant material.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cdf8d68626cc7c23b275e9255b1cf2186ad34b27

Cases underwent enucleation and HA orbital implantation were enrolled in this study and were divided into 3 groups according to the wrapping material of HA implant. Cases with autogenous cartilage caps were enrolled in group A (n=11), with donor sclera caps in group B (n=12), and without any wrapping material in group C (n=9). Follow-ups were set at 1, 2wk, 1, 3, 6, and 12mo after surgery., , , RESULTS, Altogether 32 cases finished the follow-up and were enrolled in this study. Three cases (27.27%) in group A, 4 cases (33.33%) in group B, and 4 cases (44.44%) in group C developed one complication each after surgery. In group A, no HA exposure occurred, but conjunctival inclusion cyst occurred in one and severe conjunctive chemosis in two cases. In group B, one HA exposure occurred, conjunctive inclusion cysts occurred in one, severe conjunctive chemosis occurred in one, and conjunctival granuloma occurred in one case. In group C, one HA exposure occurred, severe conjunctive chemosis occurred in two cases, and conjunctival granuloma occurred in one case. The case of exposure of none-wrapped implant was noted in the first 6mo after placement of the orbital implant. The case of exposure of donor sclera-wrapped implant was noted at the 12mo after placement of the orbital implant. Both exposure cases were treated successfully with conservative treatment., , , CONCLUSION, With low incidence of implant exposure and mild complications, auricular cartilage can be a good choice of alternative wrapping material of orbit implant with satisfied outcome.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ba313fca74ca448e8a08761e277eb07c5ea94b5

Owing to the necessity of following strict anti-epidemic sanitary measures when taking care of infected patients, the accessibility of standard diagnostic methods may be limited. Consequently, the significance and potential of bedside diagnostic modalities increase, including lung ultrasound (LUS). Method: Multicenter registry study involving adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, for whom LUS was performed. Results: A total of 228 patients (61% males) qualified for the study. The average age was 60 years (±14), 40% were older than 65 years of age. In 130 from 173 hospitalized patients, HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) was performed. In 80% of patients, LUS findings indicated interstitial pneumonia. In hospitalized patients multifocally located single B-lines, symmetrical B-lines, and areas of white lung were significantly more frequent as compared to ambulatory patients. LUS findings, both those indicating interstitial syndrome and consolidations, were positively correlated with HRCT images. As compared to HRCT, the sensitivity and specificity of LUS in detecting interstitial pneumonia were 97% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: As compared to HRCT, LUS is characterized by a very high sensitivity and specificity in detecting interstitial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.

Several reports have highlighted the lack of dyspnoea in a subgroup of patients suffering from COVID-19, sometimes referred to as “silent” or “happy hypoxaemia.” Reports have also mentioned the absence of a clear relationship between the clinical severity of the disease and levels of breathlessness reported by patients. The cerebral complications of COVID-19 have been largely demonstrated with a high prevalence of an acute encephalopathy that could possibly affect the processing of afferent signals or top-down modulation of breathlessness signals. In this review, we aim to highlight the mechanisms involved in breathlessness and summarize the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its known effects on the brain-lung interaction. We then offer hypotheses for the alteration of breathlessness perception in COVID-19 patients and suggest ways of further researching this phenomenon.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a37e7ef34712316b35b828e15d319b1e7b11101d

Methods: A retrospective review was performed on clinical records of patients ⩽18 years of age , managed with enucleation and HA implant placement. Recorded outcomes included implant-related complications, implant and prosthesis motility, and patient cosmetic satisfaction. Results: There were 525 children (531 sockets) with HA implant following enucleation. The mean age at HA implant placement was 3 years (median, 2 years; range, 4 days to 17 years). Indications for enucleation included retinoblastoma (n = 457, 86%), uveal melanoma (n = 17, 3%), medulloepithelioma (n = 8, 2%), and others (n = 49, 9%). The HA implant was uncoated (n = 370, 70%) or polymer coated (n = 161, 30%). For the 370 uncoated implants, wrapping was provided with scleral (n = 346, 94%) or bovine pericardium (n = 1, <1%), and 23 patients (6%) had no wrapping. The extraocular muscles were attached to the implant/polymer coat/wrap (n = 531, 100%), by suturing 4 rectus muscles (n = 349, 66%) or all 6 muscles (n = 182, 34%). Over mean follow up of 60 months, in 477 orbital implants, complications included conjunctival thinning (n = 10, 2%), implant infection (n = 6, 1%), implant exposure (n = 13, 3%), and implant migration/extrusion (n = 0, 0%). Motility for implant was judged as excellent (n = 245, 78%) and small-angle prosthesis motility was excellent (n = 196, 59%). Patient/family satisfaction with cosmetic outcome was rated as excellent in 471 implants (99%).

In the late 1960s, a strong interest was raised in studying ceramics as potential bone grafts due to their biomechanical properties. A bit later, such synthetic biomaterials were called bioceramics. In principle, bioceramics can be prepared from diverse materials but this review is limited to calcium orthophosphate-based formulations only, which possess the specific advantages due to the chemical similarity to mammalian bones and teeth. During the past 40 years, there have been a number of important achievements in this field. Namely, after the initial development of bioceramics that was just tolerated in the physiological environment, an emphasis was shifted towards the formulations able to form direct chemical bonds with the adjacent bones. Afterwards, by the structural and compositional controls, it became possible to choose whether the calcium orthophosphate-based implants remain biologically stable once incorporated into the skeletal structure or whether they were resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of regenerative bioceramics was developed and such formulations became an integrated part of the tissue engineering approach. Now calcium orthophosphate scaffolds are designed to induce bone formation and vascularization. These scaffolds are often porous and harbor different biomolecules and/or cells. Therefore, current biomedical applications of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics include bone augmentations, artificial bone grafts, maxillofacial reconstruction, spinal fusion, periodontal disease repairs and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Perspective future applications comprise drug delivery and tissue engineering purposes because calcium orthophosphates appear to be promising carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and various types of cells.;Yes;No;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc9bf93af746cbd31b7c7fd512eac56821a6e1a2

Pick serve government build.;Poster;Abstract Purpose: To compare variables and outcomes from ocular trauma leading to either enucleation or evisceration to better inform surgical decision making. Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: We reviewed 441 patients between 2001 and 2012 presenting with ocular trauma to a Level 1 trauma center in Queens, New York; of these, there were 16 enucleations and 6 eviscerations. Retrospective chart review noted age, gender, mechanism of injury, initial and final visual acuity, time to surgery, length of follow-up, pain, degree of motility, and complications. A review of literature in the context of our study was performed. Results: 20 patients were male and 2 patients were female; average age was 44 (SD: 20.0, range 18–91). 9/16 patients were enucleated to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia, whereas only 1/5 patient was eviscerated for this indication (p = 0.1619). No cases of sympathetic ophthalmia were reported over an average follow-up of 316 days. Average length of follow-up varied significantly between the two groups, with an average of 370.4 days (SD: 566.9, range 0–1870) for enucleated eyes and 172.7 days (SD: 146.3, range 0–422) for eviscerated eyes (p = 0.42). Medpor implants were preferred in eviscerations (5/6 eviscerations), whereas hydroxyapatite implants were preferred in enucleations (10/16 enucleations, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Surgical decision-making in ocular trauma is largely based on surgeon preference and experience, with minimal evidence in the literature to support either enucleation or evisceration. We recommend evisceration over enucleation in cases of reliable patient follow-up due to the low incidence of sympathetic ophthalmia.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91a50d406e397133363528b4471f36c09d11db92

Methods: Case series. Analysis of the clinical charts of 25 patients (age 5 to 62 years) who were submitted to explantation of exposed hydroxyapatite orbital implants, followed by simultaneous replacement with a dermis-fat graft by 1 oculoplastic surgeon between 2000 and 2011. A histopathological and microbiological evaluation of implant sections was performed. This study adheres to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Results: Microbiological examination showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci infection in 59% of the patients. Histopathological examination showed the presence of a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in 22 of the implants (88%) and significantly reduced fibrovascular colonization of the implant in all patients. Conclusions: The reduction of fibrovascular ingrowth resulted in poor integration of the implant in the eye socket. The exposure allowed bacterial colonization of the implant, causing a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. A dermis-fat graft at the same time of explantation can be considered a suitable surgical option in both adults and children: only minor complications may occur, and cosmetic results are satisfactory.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09eef2eb7d63bd7dcee69f3cb3e765d24031aed2

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first description of this technique for acrylic implant exposure and paediatric patients. Purpose: To demonstrate the versatility of the TPFG in orbital implant exposures of varying duration, implant types and patient age as well as for recurrent exposure. Methods: Retrospective, interventional, non-comparative case series. Results: Twelve patients (13 grafts) are presented with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months. The duration of exposure prior to grafting ranged from 1–11 months occurring in bioceramic, hydroxyapatite, porous polyethylene and acrylic implant types. There were 2 graft failures (success rate 84.6%), one of which was treated with a 2nd TPFG. Two of the cases were from the paediatric age group.

The color change (ΔE) of each specimen was measured with a Crystaleye spectrophotometer, and fluorescence loss (ΔQ) was measured by quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF), at different time points after treatment: baseline (0 weeks), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks., , , RESULTS, The ΔE and ΔQ baseline values for the four groups before the treatments did not differ significantly. Icon treatment improved the WSL color significantly and gave the lowest ΔE (2.9 ± 1.2 on average) compared with other treatments (P < .01). The Icon treatment also resulted in a significant change in the ΔQ of WSLs compared with baseline (P < .01). In the NaF and CPP-ACP treatment groups, ΔQ showed significant recovery compared with the baseline values only after 4 weeks after treatment (P < .05)., , , CONCLUSIONS, Resin infiltration is more effective than NaF or CPP-ACP in providing esthetic improvement of WSLs.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/028a0e39fe57e1b740c5e62a9a8b88c6863ad687

Various indeed minute entire save. Into picture call environmental.;Poster;Purpose: To determine the exposure rate after enucleation using the smooth surface tunnel (SST) and SST-EZ porous polyethylene (PP) orbital implants (Stryker Kalamazoo, MI, U.S.A.). Methods: The authors performed an institutional review board–approved retrospective review of 150 consecutively placed SST and SST-EZ PP implants after enucleation. Patient records were reviewed for comorbidities, surgical details, follow-up length, and presence of implant exposure. All prior published studies on porous orbital implant insertion were reviewed, and the exposure rate for patients undergoing enucleation with primary implant insertion was studied for comparison. Results: Of the 150 implants, 30 were excluded due to follow up of less than 8 weeks. Of the remaining 120 implants, 4 (3.3%) became exposed during the follow-up period (mean, 2.1 years), 2 of which were in children who underwent chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. The authors calculated a 7.1% exposure rate for all porous implant materials placed primarily after enucleation from 58 previously published studies. Conclusions: The SST and SST-EZ PP implants are well tolerated when placed at the time of enucleation. The theoretical advantage of a smooth anterior surface may indeed lead to a lower rate of exposure compared with standard unwrapped porous materials as demonstrated by the relatively low exposure rate using this implant.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77dbe734572c7b0776d8c88b94e214495dea6c79

Somebody around cover option ever world Mrs institution.;FullPaper;Ideally meta-analyses (MAs) should consolidate the characteristics of orthodontic research in order to produce an evidence-based answer. However severe flaws are frequently observed in most of them. The aim of this study was to evaluate the statistical methods, the methodology, and the quality characteristics of orthodontic MAs and to assess their reporting quality during the last years. Electronic databases were searched for MAs (with or without a proper systematic review) in the field of orthodontics, indexed up to 2011. The AMSTAR tool was used for quality assessment of the included articles. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, and generalized linear modelling. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to represent changes during the years in reporting of key items associated with quality. A total of 80 MAs with 1086 primary studies were included in this evaluation. Using the AMSTAR tool, 25 (27.3%) of the MAs were found to be of low quality, 37 (46.3%) of medium quality, and 18 (22.5%) of high quality. Specific characteristics like explicit protocol definition, extensive searches, and quality assessment of included trials were associated with a higher AMSTAR score. Model selection and dealing with heterogeneity or publication bias were often problematic in the identified reviews. The number of published orthodontic MAs is constantly increasing, while their overall quality is considered to range from low to medium. Although the number of MAs of medium and high level seems lately to rise, several other aspects need improvement to increase their overall quality.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be850f1c92a81a0b272f96a5433c5df978d660e5

Methods Search strategy: four databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid ALL EMB Reviews, PubMed and BIREME) were selected to search relevant articles covering the period from January 1965 to December 2012. Selection Criteria: in first consensus by reading the title and abstract. The full text was obtained from publications that met the inclusion criteria. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data using the keywords: conventional, self-ligating, biofilm, Streptococcus mutans, and systematic review; and independently evaluated the quality of the studies. In case of divergence, the technique of consensus was adopted. Results The search strategy resulted in 1,401 articles. The classification of scientific relevance revealed the high quality of the 6 eligible articles of which outcomes were not unanimous in reporting not only the influence of the design of the brackets (conventional or self-ligating) over adhesion and formation of colonies of Streptococcus mutans, but also that other factors such as the quality of the bracket type, the level of individual oral hygiene, bonding and age may have greater influence. Statistical analysis was not feasible because of the heterogeneous methodological design. Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that there is no evidence for a possible influence of the design of the brackets (conventional or self-ligating) over colony formation and adhesion of Streptococcus mutans.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbe71e22d6c98f51d1299314479c3e04dc5eb621

Left paper religious expert apply house.;ShortPaper;BACKGROUND, Demineralised white lesions (DWLs) can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brackets that attach the braces to the teeth. Fluoride is effective in reducing decay in susceptible individuals in the general population. Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment. This review compares the effects of various forms of fluoride used during orthodontic treatment on the development of DWLs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004., , , OBJECTIVES, The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of DWLs on the teeth during orthodontic treatment.The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of fluoride delivery in reducing the incidence of DWLs, as well as the size of lesions. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DWLs, and oral health-related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects., , , SEARCH METHODS, We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 31 January 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 31 January 2013); and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 31 January 2013)., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, We included trials if they met the following criteria: (1) parallel-group randomised clinical trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which (2) the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed., , , MAIN RESULTS, For the 2013 update of this review, three changes were made to the protocol regarding inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies included in the previous version of the review were excluded from this update for the following reasons: five previously included studies were quasi-randomised, a further five were split-mouth studies, three measured outcomes on extracted teeth only and in one, the same fluoride intervention was used in each intervention group of the study.Three studies and 458 participants were included in this updated review. One study was assessed at low risk of bias for all domains, in one study the risk of bias was unclear and in the remaining study, the risk of bias was high.One placebo-controlled study of fluoride varnish applied every six weeks (253 participants, low risk of bias), provided moderate-quality evidence of an almost 70% reduction in DWLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44, P value < 0.001). This finding is considered to provide moderate-quality evidence for this intervention because it has not yet been replicated by further studies in orthodontic participants.One study compared two different formulations of fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse prescribed for participants undergoing orthodontic treatment (97 participants, unclear risk of bias) and found no difference between an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination and a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination for the outcomes of white spot index, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index.One small study (37 participants) compared the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The study was assessed at high risk of bias because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up, and compliance with use of the mouthrinse was not measured.Neither secondary outcomes of this review nor adverse effects of interventions were reported in any of the included studies., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, This review found some moderate evidence that fluoride varnish applied every six weeks at the time of orthodontic review during treatment is effective, but this finding is based on a single study. Further adequately powered, double-blind, randomised controlled trials are required to determine the best means of preventing DWLs in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment and the most accurate means of assessing compliance with treatment and possible adverse effects. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DWLs on participant satisfaction with treatment.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/245eef0958cb5cbebd7ce53691fa0544521cd9b2

Materials and Methods: In this study, comparison tests using the alcohol-free 0.1% chlorhexidine mouth rinse, alcohol-containing essential oil mouth rinse, and alcohol-free essential oil-containing mouth rinse were conducted. Patients were instructed to avoid mechanical cleaning with either a toothbrush or toothpick for 4 days. The first samples were collected from teeth surfaces and the dorsum of the tongue after a professional cleaning, and the second samples were collected after a 4-day plaque re-growth period. The supragingival plaque from the buccal surfaces of teeth #11, 14, 31, 34 as well as samples from the dorsum of the tongue, were assessed using the Dentocult® strips. Results: The Listerine® and Ondrohexidine® groups did not show any statistically significant differences between the values of the two samples (P = 0.734, P = 0.307). The MC® group and the control group showed significantly higher results than the first sample values. The effectiveness of the mouth rinses on S. mutans colony counts from the teeth surfaces were higher in the Listerine® , Ondrohexidine® , and Mouthwash Concentrate® groups. The difference between the first and second samples of the S. mutans colony counts from the tongue surface was found to be statistically significant, and S. mutans colony counts were higher than the first sample (P = 0.015). Conclusion: Alcohol and essential oil-containing Listerine® mouth rinse, alcohol-free Ondrohexidine® , alcohol-free essential oil-containing MC® mouth rinse had the same effect on S. mutans counts, higher than the 1% alcohol solution on teeth surface. They had the ability to maintain the S. mutans counts at the same level for 4 days in patients who did not perform any mechanical oral hygiene regimen.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef8bc452429b5b2e4a06cdd66e8fb60a305610c6

The purpose of this article is to review the current evidence regarding diagnosis, risk assessment, prevention, intratreatment management, and postorthodontic treatment of WSL, and to provide clinical recommendations useful for both the orthodontist and the general dentist. Caries risk assessment should be incorporated into initial evaluations of orthodontic patients, and risk-specific prevention and management protocols can help to eliminate or minimize this clinical problem. There are multiple options for treatment of WSL, ranging from conservative to invasive techniques; the severity of lesions is a determinant of which option is most appropriate., , , CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE, White spot lesions associated with orthodontic treatment are a common problem that can be minimized with appropriate prevention, management, and treatment approaches.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2588976bce92101e74da40a30e385dec6497f53c

Each group consisted of 15 specimens. Shear bond strength was evaluated after thermo-cycling (10,000×, 5°C to 55°C) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, and data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney test, and Weibull statistics. Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scores and enamel fractures were determined at 25× magnification and were statistically analyzed by regression analyses (P < .05)., , , RESULTS, The caries infiltrant system significantly increased the shear bond strength of Transbond XT Primer, Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer, and Fuji Ortho in sound specimens, and of all resin cements except for the Concise Orthodontic Bonding System in demineralized enamel. Overall, caries infiltrant preconditioning decreased significantly the number of enamel fractures, but it did not affect ARI scores., , , CONCLUSION, Preconditioning of sound and demineralized enamel with the caries infiltrant system did not impair but rather increased the shear bond strength of most orthodontic resin cements while decreasing the risk of enamel fracture at debonding.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11f9043cf45150a441a4c9b1967d9bc3b13d47f0

The choice of procedure and implant is based upon the surgeon's experience. There remains no standardization of cosmetic result. We sought to identify quantifiable anatomical features and functional properties related to a successful cosmetic result in patients with ocular prosthesis and to determine correlations between self-reported and third-party assessment of cosmetic success. Methods: This was a prospective observational study, which included 107 adult patients (50.1% female; age 53.08 ± 18.64 years, range 18–89) with acquired anophthalmia following prosthesis fitting. Patients completed a self-assessment questionnaire on self-perception of body image and ocular properties. Three independent examiners assessed cosmetic score. Assessed variables included prosthesis movement, eyelid symmetry, prosthesis stability, and socket fullness. Results: The general cosmetic result was 8.1 ± 2.19 (on a predetermined scale of 1–10) as perceived by the patients and 7.2 ± 0.19 by the examiners. Interexaminer correlation was high for all variables (P < 0.05). A good cosmetic result was correlated with prosthesis movement (P = 0.02), eyelid symmetry (P = 0.001), and prosthesis stability (P = 0.01). Factors that correlated with a good cosmetic result on multivariate analysis were prosthesis movement (odds ratio [OR] 4.95, P = 0.004), eyelid symmetry (OR 4.51, P = 0.006), and socket fullness (OR 3.56, P = 0.005). No correlation was observed between patients' perceptions of the overall cosmetic result and those of the examiners. Conclusion: The cosmetic result of prosthesis use among anophthalmic patients is generally good, as perceived by both patients and examiners. Good eyelid position and symmetry, orbital fullness, and prosthesis motility were associated with a better cosmetic result.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fe061ed7ba98dad1e3902748b3fe30c5c26ac8b

Implant sizing was performed intra-operatively to place the largest implant without tension on the wound closure. Outcome measures included implant complications, prosthesis measurements, and incidence of a good aesthetic outcome. Good outcome was defined as <2 mm enophthalmos and grade 1 or less superior sulcus deformity with a custom ocular prosthesis. Results Eighteen hundred eyes of 1800 patients were included. The mean age at surgery was 36 ± 21 years (median 32 years). Implants used were poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in 1737 (97%) and porous polyethylene in 63 (3%) patients. Two-petal sclerotomy was performed in 1512 (88%) and four-petal sclerotomy in 165 (10%) patients. The mean diameter of the implant used was 19.35 ± 1.18 mm (median 20, range 10–22 mm). The implant extrusion rate was 3% (56) and implant displacement was seen in none. The mean prosthesis volume and thickness were 2.22 ± 0.67 ml (median 2, range 1–6.5 ml) and 6 ± 1 mm (median 6, range 2–9 mm).

Same their end light building center.;Save plan relationship. Painting door trade eye to star. White impact year.;Poster;Purpose of review The introduction of porous orbital implants has modified the surgical approach towards the rehabilitation of the anophthalmic socket. Since then, many steps forward have been taken. The present study highlights the most recent advances in the treatment of anophthalmic socket on the basis of a review of the most relevant studies. Recent findings Current studies analysing the treatment of anophthalmic socket focus on the follow-up of a large series of orbital implants, the mechanism of extrusion of implants, the management of implant extrusion, and the treatment of contracted socket. Orbital volume augmentation with self-inflating expanders has been suggested as a useful technique to treat congenital anophthalmia, though custom-made conformers may produce similar results. Summary Implant materials and wrapping, surgical technique and treatment of lid malpositions associated with postenucleation socket syndrome are all factors affecting the rehabilitation of patients with anophthalmia. Current clinical evidence does not support porous implants with respect to nonporous implants. The treatment of congenital anophthalmia is directed through a simultaneous stimulation of both soft tissue and bony orbital growth. Further studies with extensive follow-ups are necessary as adverse effects may develop many years after socket surgery.;Yes;Yes;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61bad732fcdc719eadcdfae8a7172fcaa331117d

This study reviews the recent advances in the management of acquired socket contracture. Recent findings For mild contracture, several recent studies describe the beneficial use of amniotic membrane as a substrate graft to allow the conjunctival epithelium to migrate and multiply. To correct moderately severe socket contracture, quilting sutures are typically used to ensure survival of mucous membrane grafts, which are required to provide adequate lining to the socket. In cases of severe socket contraction, irradiated sockets, and recurrent socket contraction, radial-free forearm flaps or a variety of other flaps in association with bone expansion osteotomies are on the rise.

Patients and Methods This study is a retrospective case series. Secondary orbital implant insertion was performed for 25 anophthalmic patients (25 eyes) who had experienced primary evisceration more than 10 years earlier. Under general anesthesia, secondary enucleation removing the contracted sclera, including the optic nerve, was performed, and diverse types of porous orbital implants were inserted. After surgery, changes in the socket and ocular prosthesis motility, and improvements in esthetic appearance were evaluated. Results For 24 of the 25 eyes, the patients were satisfied. In 17 eyes, ocular motility was higher than “fair” and showed improvement. Deep superior sulcus deformity was improved to “good” in 8 eyes, and enophthalmos was improved to “fair” in 15 eyes. Combined procedures to correct lid malposition and fornix contracture were successful, and these additional operations to correct the prolonged complications of anophthalmos might have reduced the frequency of implant exposure. Conclusions In older anophthalmic patients with considerable concomitant socket contracture and cosmetic concerns, secondary porous orbital implant insertion may improve esthetics and the motility of the ocular prosthesis.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3615d5b21881e090817a0bac4eccad5d1a31040b

This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the features of the syndrome, based on literature review and authors’ clinical and surgical experience. An electronic database (PubMed,MEDLINE and Google Scholar) search of all articles written in English and non-English language with abstract translated to English on anophthalmic socket syndrome was performed. Data reviewed included demographics, presentations, investigations, management, complications and outcomes. Different types of orbital implants were evaluated; the management of implant exposure was examined; different orbital volume enhancement procedures such as secondary implantation, subperiosteal implants and the use of fillers in anophthalmic patients were described; the problems related to socket contraction were outlined; the treatment options for chronic anophthalmic socket pain and phantom eye syndrome were assessed; the most recent advances in the management of congenital anophthalmia were described. Current clinical evidence does not support a specific orbital implant; late exposure of porous implants may be due to pegging, which currently is seldom used; filler absorption in the orbit appears to be faster than in the dermis, and repeated treatments could be a potential source of inflammation; socket contraction results in significant functional and psychological disability, and management is challenging. Patients affected by anophthalmic socket pain and phantom eye syndrome need specific counseling. It is auspicable to use a standardized protocol to treat children affected by clinical congenital anophthalmia; dermis fat graft is a suitable option in these patients as it helps continued socket expansion. Dermis fat graft can also address the volume deficit in case of explantation of exposed implants and in contracted sockets in both children and adults. Appropriate clinical care is essential, as adequate prosthesis wearing improves the quality of life of anophthalmic patients.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e39ef28a35e21f442022ea6e7076b022c0f3ca0

Methods Retrospective observational case series. Eighty-two patients underwent evisceration or enucleation surgery by one surgeon over a 2-year period. Fentanyl by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) at 20 µg/kg with 12 mg/kg ondansetron or intravenous ketorolac at 2 mg/kg/day was administered to patients at postoperative days 0, 1, and 2. The pain score was measured using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS). The incidence of severe nausea requiring anti-emetics and the incidence of vomiting were reviewed. Results The mean postoperative VAS in the fentanyl group was significantly lower than that in the ketorolac group on the day of operation for both types of surgery (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). At postoperative days 1 and 2, the mean VAS was not different between the two groups for either surgical type (p > 0.05 for both days). The mean VAS was significantly higher in eviscerated patients than in enucleated patients at postoperative days 0 and 1 in the fentanyl group (p = 0.023 and p = 0.016, respectively). However, this was not observed in the ketorolac group. The incidence of PONV was higher in the fentanyl group than in the ketorolac group, although this was not statistically significant for either surgical type (p > 0.05 for both groups). Conclusions Fentanyl was more effective as an analgesic than was ketorolac on the day of operation for both surgical types. There was no difference between the two analgesics on postoperative day 1. The analgesic effect of fentanyl in enucleated patients was significantly higher than in eviscerated patients at postoperative days 0 and 1. The use of fentanyl by IV-PCA was associated with greater PONV despite co-administration with anti-emetics, although this finding was not significant.;No;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f8ac000b7dbc2c96891d7096639f065f413dfa5

To investigate the effect of daily intake of fluoridated milk on enamel demineralization adjacent to fixed orthodontic brackets assessed with quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF). Materials and methods. Sixty-four healthy adolescents (13–18 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances were enrolled and randomly allocated to a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. The intervention group was instructed to drink one glass of milk (∼ 200 ml) supplemented with fluoride (5 ppm) once daily and the subjects of the control group to drink the same amount of milk without fluoride. The intervention period was 12 weeks and the end-point was mineral gain or loss in enamel, assessed by QLF on two selected sites from each individual. The attrition rate was 12.5% and 112 sites were included in the final evaluation. Results. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups concerning fluorescence (ΔF) values and lesion area (A mm2) at baseline. After 12 weeks, a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in ΔF was registered in the fluoridated milk group and a significant increase in the non-fluoride control group (p < 0.05). The mean reduction in the test group was somewhat lower (14%) than the increase in the control group (18%), but individual variations were evident. Only minor alterations of lesion area were recorded over the 12-week period and no statistically significant differences compared with baseline were found in any of the groups. Conclusion. Daily intake of fluoridated milk may aid remineralization of white spot lesions adjacent to fixed orthodontic appliances.;No;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be9c9327d88cfde672d8c868c85770cbcb210dff

Military ready when., Street bad mission throw watch style so.;DemoPaper;Background: Several studies have shown that laser-etching of enamel for bonding orthodontic brackets could be an appropriate alternative for acid conditioning, since a potential advantage of laser could or might be caries prevention. This study compared enamel resistance to demineralization following etching with acid phosphoric or Er:YAG laser for bonding orthodontic brackets. Materials and Methods: Fifty sound human premolars were divided into two equal groups. In the first group, enamel was etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds. In the second group, Er:YAG laser (wavelength, 2 940 nm; 300 mJ/pulse, 10 pulses per second, 10 seconds) was used for tooth conditioning. The teeth were subjected to 4-day PH-cycling process to induce caries-like lesions. The teeth were then sectioned and the surface area of the lesion was calculated in each microphotographs and expressed in pixel. The total surface of each specimen was 196 608 pixels. Results: Mean lesion areas were 7 171 and 7532 pixels for Laser-etched and Acid-etched groups, respectively. The two sample t-test showed that there was no significant difference in lesion area between the two groups (P = 0.914). Conclusion: Although Er:YAG laser seems promising for etching enamel before bonding orthodontic brackets, it does not reduce enamel demineralization when exposed to acid challenge.;Yes;No;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bdb702bb288fed9ad3d9514f22e0c6ae87a8d72

Film far school ready when.;ShortPaper;To the Editor: We read with great interest the report by Tabatabaee et al. entitled “Comparison of the Exposure Rate of Wrapped Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Eye) Versus Unwrapped Porous Polyethylene (Medpor) Orbital Implants in Enucleated Patients.” The report insightfully outlines the difficulty in comparing the exposure rates of previous reports due to differing indications for surgery, the size of the implant placed, the presence of previous infection, and the variability among surgical techniques. However, based on our previous experience with unwrapped porous polyethylene (PP) orbital implants, we were surprised by the 34% exposure rate as outlined in the report. This is much higher than previous reports and certainly higher than what we have experienced in our own practice. In their discussion, the authors emphasize the difficulty in comparing exposure rates among different surgeons. However, the outcomes of 2 different surgeons are reported in this study. While their description of the surgical technique used for placement of both implants mirrors a classic textbook description of an enucleation, we are led to assume that the exact procedure is followed by both surgeons. They control for many variables in their study, but interestingly, they do not specify whether both oculoplastic surgeons (Z.T., A.K.) were using PP and hydroxyapatite implants or whether one surgeon was using one implant solely. This could possibly explain the high rate of exposure in relation to one surgeon’s technique. Sadiq et al. described 26 cases of each implant type placed by a single surgeon and reported only one exposure in each group. If both surgeons (Z.T., A.K.) in fact used each implant equally, then factors influencing the selection of the implant type would be helpful in comparing exposure rates. The follow-up duration as outlined by Tabatabaee et al. was 25.7 months for the PP implants with a mean time of 13.5 months for implant exposure to occur. Our exposure rate was 4.4%: 4 out of 91 patients who had unwrapped PP orbital implant following enucleation over a mean period of 10.4 months. While the authors point out the relatively shorter follow-up period of our article, based on their report, a number of patients had exposure of the implant within 10 months following surgery, making our follow-up period relevant for postoperative implant exposure to occur. Other studies in the literature had exposure rates of unwrapped PP orbital implants specifically following enucleation closer to our exposure rate but over a longer follow-up period. We are currently reviewing the 136 cases from our original case series plus subsequent cases in which an unwrapped PP was implanted following enucleation or evisceration. We will report the data when they are available. We do not anticipate that a significantly longer follow-up duration will reveal exposure rates that even approach the 34% reported in this article. We certainly welcome clarification of the points outlined above. The data presented in Tabatabaee’s important article could then be revisited and reanalyzed, which would contribute greatly to our current knowledge of the exposure rate of porous orbital implants following enucleation and to our understanding of appropriate orbital implant selection and improve the surgical techniques used for enucleation.;No;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22b7734b1b7e189d97944c7e90897fe60c3879b7

The specimens of each group were subdivided (n  =  16) into different subgroups. Subgroup A received no topical fluoride application during pH cycling, while the experimental subgroups received topical fluoride treatments as follows: B, application three times per day of fluoride dentifrice (1450 ppm F); C, application one time per day of fluoride mouth rinse (250 ppm F); and D, combination of fluoride dentifrice and fluoride mouth rinse. After 14 days of pH cycling, the shear bond strength and Adhesive Remnant Index were evaluated statistically., , , RESULTS, Polarized light microscopy showed that pH cycling induced mineral loss in all specimens. The topical application of fluoride did not have an influence on shear bond strength, although the association of fluoride dentifrice and mouth rinse increased the shear bond strength of the resinous cement without fluoride (P < .01). Regarding the Adhesive Remnant Index, no statistical differences were found within the groups G1 (P  =  .23), G2 (P  =  .47), and G3 (P  =  .74)., , , CONCLUSION, Topical fluoride treatments improved the shear bond strength of resinous cement, regardless of the material's fluoride-releasing capacity, and reached the adhesive fractures.;No;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76ae27569e4680089d99b840e565df134f11ca7f

Direct contact test (DCT) was used to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal activity of products after 48 h and 7 days of incubation. The results demonstrated that all the cements presented antibacterial activity but the antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements was more than that of zinc phosphate cements. Counts of C. albicans after 48 h were lower and statistically different in the GIC group in relation to the control groups. But no differences were observed between GIC and control groups at 7 days.

Databases were searched for clinical trials up to 18 March 2011. Article inclusion criteria were as follows: caries-related primary outcomes were tested; xylitol was compared with topical fluoride in some form; two-arm (or more) clinical trial including test/control group(s); prospective study design. Article exclusion criteria were as follows: no computable data were reported; test and control groups were not followed up in the same way; chewing gum was the main form of clinical application in either group. Individual continuous datasets were extracted from accepted articles. Selection and performance/detection bias were assessed. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate attrition bias risk. Egger's regression and funnel plot was used to investigate publication bias risk. Twelve articles were included. Of these, six were accepted and six excluded, and 21 continuous datasets were extracted. Owing to the high clinical heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was performed. The addition of xylitol to existing fluoride regimes may be beneficial in the prevention of caries. However, all identified trials were limited by potential risk of selection, performance/detection and attrition bias. The funnel plot and Egger's regression results (-2.80; 95% confidence interval -4.01, -1.58; P = 0.0001) indicated possible publication bias risk. External fluoride access may have confounded the measured anticariogenic effect of xylitol. The evidence found contains a high risk of bias and may be limited by confounder effects. Future high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed in order to provide conclusive evidence on this topic.;No;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35a2c68bf360528f1f894f1e75a1b7498c783d4d

Budget they election care say around.;Yet sister however by technology set know. Performance present us themselves. Yourself blue role wide.;Poster;ABSTRACT Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of porous and nonporous implants for management of the anophthalmic socket. Methods: Case series meta-analysis was conducted with no language restriction, including studies from: PUBMED, EMBASE and LILACS. Study eligibility criteria were case series design with more than 20 cases reported, use of porous and/or nonporous orbital implants, anophthalmic socket and, treatment success defined as no implant exposure or extrusion. Complications rates from each included study were quantified. Proportional meta-analysis was performed on both outcomes with a random-effects model and the 95% confidential intervals were calculated. Results: A total of 35 case series studies with a total of 3,805 patients were included in the meta-analysis. There are no studies comparing porous and nonporous implants in the anophthalmic socket treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between porous polyethylene (PP) and hydroxyapatite (HA) on implant exposure: 0.026 (0.012–0.045) vs 0.054 (0.041–0.070), respectively and, neither on implant extrusion: 0.0042 (0.0008–0.010) vs. 0.018 (0.004–0.042), respectively. However, there was a significant difference supporting the use of PP when compared to bioceramic implant: 0.026 (0.012 –0.045) vs. 0.12 (0.06–0.20), respectively, on implant exposure. Conclusion: PP implants showed lower chance of exposure than bioceramic implant for anophthalmic socket reconstruction, although we cannot rule out the possibility of heterogeneity bias due to the nature and level of evidence of the included studies. Clinical trials are necessary to expand the knowledge of porous and nonporous orbital implants in the anophthalmic socket management.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32b26be58aff870b09a712a9d598c8b2692cc3f5

Nach einer Injektion von 1,5 ml 96 %igem Ethanol ist die Patientin seit 6 Monaten anhaltend nahezu beschwerdefrei. Orbitaler Schmerz nach Enukleation oder Eviszeration kann seine Ursache im Implantat selbst, in der Prothese, der Prothesenhöhle oder den Nasennebenhöhlen haben. Eine sorgfältige Anamnese und Untersuchung inklusive orbitaler Bildgebung sind notwendig, um die korrekte Differenzialdiagnose zu erhalten. Wenn eine Pathologie als Grundlage des Schmerzes ausgeschlossen erscheint, sollte auch an den häufig vorkommenden Phantomschmerz gedacht werden. Die Behandlung chronischer orbitaler Schmerzen findet nicht immer die gebührliche Würdigung.

Between 2001 and 2004, Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva were closed in separate layers; after 2004, a simplified 1-layer closure following eye removal was used. The primary outcome parameters were presence or absence of implant exposure or extrusion., , , RESULTS, One hundred fifty-seven patients who underwent evisceration and 172 patients who underwent enucleation were included. Following evisceration, 2.5% developed exposure or extrusion of the implant, this was 2.5% in the 1-layer closure technique and 2.7% in the 2-layer closure technique (p = 0.95). Following enucleation, 1.7% developed exposure or extrusion of the implant, this was 1.8% in the 1-layer closure technique and 1.7% in the 2-layer closure technique (p = 0.96). Overall implant exposure and extrusion was 2.1%, this was 2.2% in the 1-layer closure technique and 2.1% in the 2-layer closure technique (p = 0.96)., , , CONCLUSIONS, No difference was found in the frequency of spheric acrylic implant exposure or extrusion in patients who underwent eye removal with single-layer closure of Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva compared with patients treated with separate closure of these layers.;Yes;No;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b03fba415e0c84cdd8c3d599d767db62095ab7c0

Expert field eye today check inside treatment.;Poster;We would like to present a surgical technique of orbital socket reconstruction using oversized dermis fat graft and 22 mm silicone orbital implant in a single-stage after extended enucleation in two patients with massive local recurrence of anteriorly located choroidal melanoma previously treated with endoresection. Orbital tissues en bloc were removed leaving conjunctival lining only at the fornices. Simultaneously, the 22 mm silicone sphere was implanted deeply into the orbit and covered with the oversized dermis fat graft of 30 mm in height and 35 mm in length with 20 mm of the fat thickness. The graft was sutured to the residual forniceal conjunctiva with interrupted 6/0 absorbable sutures overlapping conjunctiva with the graft edge for 2 mm to facilitate the epithelization. Epithelization was completed in two months, leaving well-formed fornices with good fitting of the prosthesis. The key point of orbital socket reconstruction after extended enucleation is to restore conjunctival lining prior to volume. Thus, whenever facing a massive volume and conjunctival lining loss, simultaneous insertion of the 22 mm silicone sphere deep into the orbit combined with oversized dermis fat graft is, in our opinion, the method of choice. It proved to be safe and effective with favourable long-term results.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af93375e2e647a6782fda686125d73d6b699af6c

Range campaign management year under kid maybe.;FullPaper;Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common ocular cancer, and it typically presents before the age of 5 years in over 90% of cases. In high resource countries, RB patients tend to survive and retain their sight. This is not the case in low-resource countries because of late presentation and delayed intervention arising mostly from sociocultural and socioeconomic challenges. RB has no gender or racial predilection; the incidence is estimated as 1:16,000–1:18,000 live-births or 11/1 million children under 5 years. Most of the world's RB cases are found in Asia and Africa while most RB treatment centres are in America and Europe. RB is easy to detect by caregivers as a glowing white 'cat eye reflex' at night or when captured on camera. Health workers at primary care level can detect RB in early life if red reflex test and/or squint (Hirschberg) tests are deployed as part of wellness checks done especially during routine immunisation and well-baby clinics in the first 24 months of life. In most cases of RB, biopsies for histological confirmation are not required for diagnosis and treatment decisions to be made. Clinical information, ophthalmic evaluation and imaging modalities are typically used. There have been significant changes in the management of RB using various treatment modalities such as enucleation with orbital implant, use of chemotherapy delivered through intravenous, intravitreal, periocular and intra-arterial routes and targeted treatment with laser, cryotherapy and brachytherapy. Algorithm for management and development of the national RB program within the context of a low-resource country is presented from review of data extracted from Mendeley library, PubMed library, Google Scholar and One Network; full-text articles were mostly retrieved through the American Academy of Ophthalmology.;No;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e6b03c30df57206760478501c1f88dba27601a9

Methods: Retrospective case note review of patients who underwent secondary orbital implant insertion through a subciliary incision between January 2006 and December 2017. Collected data included age, gender, type and cause of primary surgery, time interval before secondary implantation, and details of secondary implantation surgery. The main outcome parameters included postoperative appearance, grade of superior sulcus deformity (SSD), implant centration, and prosthesis function. Results: Thirty-eight patients ranging from 2 to 54 years had undergone secondary alloplastic orbital implant placement through the subciliary approach. The mean follow-up was 5.3 years (range: 1–10 years). All the patients showed satisfactory orbital volume with the average SSD was grade 0.74. There were no cases with implant exposure or extrusion. Implant migration occurred in six cases (15.8%). Fitting a prosthesis was possible in all cases. Conclusion: Subciliary secondary orbital implantation is proved to be effective in correcting volume deficiency in acquired anophthalmia with rapid rehabilitation while avoiding anterior surface breakdown and implant exposure.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b78cb1a654ecac73e57a1cc0dea6b84c89c20a71

Everyone cell Democrat worker.;FullPaper;Objective: The aim of this paper was to update the evidence for primary and secondary prevention (treatment) of white spot lesions (WSL) adjacent to fixed orthodontic appliances. Material and methods: A search for relevant human clinical trials published in English between 2004 and March 2011 retrieved 25 publications that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The papers were assessed for prevented fraction and/or absolute risk reduction when possible. Results and conclusions: The findings consolidated the use of topical fluorides in addition to fluoride toothpaste as the best evidence-based way to avoid WSL. The mean prevented fraction based on 6 trials was 42.5% with a range from -4% to 73%. The recent papers provided the strongest support for regular professional applications of fluoride varnish around the bracket base during the course of orthodontic treatment. For the treatment of post-orthodontic WSL, home-care applications of a remineralizing cream, based on casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate, as adjunct to fluoride toothpaste could be beneficial but the findings were equivocal. For emerging technologies such as sugar alcohols and probiotics, still only studies with surrogate endpoints are available. Thus, further well-designed studies with standardized regimes and endpoints are needed before guidelines on the non-fluoride technologies can be recommended.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ca6d7029cf304e915992045503f59e3a30cc29a

This study reports the outcomes of the use of autologous pericranium graft in association with a large primary or secondary orbital implant in patients with a contracted socket and large orbital volume deficit. Methods: This was a retrospective single-institution study. Participants were 13 patients with contracted socket, volume deficit, and insufficient conjunctiva to cover the new implant divided into two groups, A (n = 3) and B (n = 10), according to the baseline condition of the socket. Surgery was primary evisceration (group A only) and placement of a large orbital implant followed by an autologous pericranium graft over the implant (groups A and B). Results: Mean follow-up duration for the patient series was 9.5 months (range 9–24). Complete epithelialization of the pericranium graft was recorded at 47.3 days of follow-up (range 33–67). No cases of implant exposure or shrinkage were noted during follow-up. Main postoperative complications were conjunctival granuloma (five patients, 38.5%), conjunctival seroma (one patient, 7.7%). All patients were satisfied with the aesthetic outcome. Conclusion: Autologous pericranial graft was effective in reconstructing the contracted socket so that the anophthalmic socket could accommodate a larger or secondary orbital implant. The efficacy of this procedure needs to be confirmed in a larger patient series.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91707e1fd733c23569d1e1aa03d415b23aeff31f

Currently, the evisceration method using silicone balls is useful in animals; however, it is not available to those with impaired cornea or severe ocular atrophy. Moreover, ocular implant and prostheses are not widely used because of the diversity in animal size and eye shape, and high manufacturing cost. Here, we produced low-cost and customized artificial eyes, including implant and prosthesis, using computer-aided design and three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. For 3D modeling, the size of the artificial eyes was optimized using B-mode ultrasonography. The design was exported to STL files, and then printed using polycaprolactone (PCL) for prosthesis and mixture of PCL and hydroxyapatite (HA) for ocular implant. The 3D printed artificial eyes could be produced in less than one and half hour. The prosthesis was painted using oil colors and biocompatible resin. Two types of eye removal surgery, including evisceration and enucleation, were performed using two beagle dogs, as a preliminary study. After the surgery, the dogs were clinically evaluated for 6 months and then histopathological evaluation of the implant was done. Ocular implant was biocompatible and host tissue ingrowth was induced after in vivo application. The custom-made prosthesis was cosmetically excellent. Although long-term clinical follow-up might be required, the use of 3D printed-customized artificial eyes may be beneficial for animals that need personalized artificial eye surgery.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c059a57d83029dd0e44d7a7136ae3cd923b6575

Tax I include outside drive. New tonight mean defense. Evidence explain represent important around century off.;ShortPaper;This paper aims to assess systematic reviews on the caries-preventive effect of topical fluorides, identifying key content and reporting quality issues to be considered by researchers planning a review in this area. Published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of any topical fluoride intervention for caries control were included. Relevant databases were searched (December 2009), along with reference lists of included publications. Thirty-eight reports were identified and assessed. A majority of these focused on the child/adolescent population, fluoride toothpastes, no treatment/placebo comparisons, and had caries increment as the main outcome. Complete reporting of eligibility criteria (PICOS) was uncommon, except in Cochrane reviews. Less than half reported searching multiple sources and only one third reported a search strategy. Duplicate study selection and data extraction was reported in 27 (71%) and 16 (42%) reviews, respectively; quality assessment of included studies was not reported in one third of the reviews. Meta-analysis was reported in 20 (52%) reviews, with six not reporting the methods of synthesis used, 17 formally assessing heterogeneity, and 12 reporting analyses for its exploration. This study shows that some content features have been covered more often than others in existing fluoride reviews, while some relevant features are yet to be addressed. Also, reporting of several methodological aspects are below an acceptable level, except for Cochrane reviews. Current reporting guidelines for systematic reviews of interventions (e.g. PRISMA) and sources of high-quality existing reviews (e.g. The Cochrane Library) should be closely followed to enhance the validity and relevance of future topical fluoride reviews.;Yes;No;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9ea461d69409106125383fc99532ca26ddf0b1f

A retrospective review of cases was performed. Results Mean age at the time of surgery was 24.7 months (range 1–65 months). The diameter of the spherical implant was 20 mm in 36 patients (81.8%) and 18 mm in 8 patients (18.2%). During a mean follow-up period of 60.1 months (range 26–93 months), there were no cases of implant exposure, extrusion or infection. Transient conjunctival thinning developed in three patients, but all resolved with conservative treatment. Anophthalmic socket complications such as lower lid malposition (retraction or entropion) (n=10, 22.7%), blepharoptosis (n=8, 18.2%) and enophthalmos (n=2, 4.5%) developed, but most showed acceptable cosmesis. Conclusions Medpor SST is relatively safe, allowing for a mean follow-up of 5 years in terms of implant exposure, and may be a good choice of orbital implant for children with retinoblastoma.;Yes;No;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f60096ba37ea8f1a1e75b8cf40c126246a7226bd

This is the dilemma we face whenenucleation or evisceration are unavoidable. The patient loses a sensory organ with a very important function and, at the same time, is faced with a major aesthetic defect, leading to significant anxiety. The purpose of this article is to describe the different reconstruction techniques for anophthalmic sockets. In preparing the anopthalmic socket for prosthesis fitting we have several options: dermis-fat graft with a very good biocompatibility, the Guthoff artificial implant, which provides better motility or the methyl methacrylate implant inside the muscle cone. Each option has advantages and disadvantages but the choice of technique should be adapted to the needs and expectations of the patient, taking into account both time and cost.;Yes;No;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae2332ce441d95e63305f9ee7bb81e7f0d8ac85c

Magazine tell anything.;DemoPaper;Purpose: Unlike ptosis, upper eyelid retraction (ULR) is not a widely reported complication of the anophthalmic socket or post-enucleation socket syndrome (PESS). The clinical entity of post-enucleation ULR is investigated. Methods: 1) Two cases of post-enucleation ULR presenting to a specialist oculoplastic center (South Australian Institute of Ophthalmology, Adelaide, Australia) are described, 2) Single forced choice survey of 22 members of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeons regarding their clinical experience of ULR in anophthalmia, and 3) English literature review. Results: One case of ULR occurred less than 1 year and the other several decades following enucleation, both cases underwent eyelid surgery. Eighty-two percent of oculoplastic surgeons surveyed believe ULR is a rare and late (50%) complication of anophthalmia and 13.5% had never seen a case. Ninety-five percent indicated that ptosis is more common than retraction. A literature review supports the rarity of ULR in anophthalmia and a number of etiological factors are discussed. Conclusions: Upper eyelid retraction is a rare and often late complication of the anophthalmic socket. It occurs less commonly than ptosis as part of PESS, but increased recognition and reporting may improve the understanding of its true incidence and cause.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ceca9c25ff4c24bd297064f99ec38ed3f5bef4ed

For each patient clinicopathological data was collected which included demographic information, clinical history, primary clinical diagnosis, main cause of ophthalmic surgery (traumatic, non-traumatic), type of surgical procedure (enucleation, evisceration) and pathological report. Patients' postoperative clinical visits were checked for procedure-related complications during first year after surgery., , , RESULTS, ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN PATIENTS (MALE: 65.4%; mean age: 26y) underwent enucleation (n=100) or evisceration (n=7) due to traumatic (n=41) and non-traumatic (n=66) causes. Disfiguring painful blind eye was the most common indication of surgery (66.4%), followed by leukocoria (19.6%) and endophthalmitis (4.7%). The main types of injury included ﬁrecracker, trafﬁc and work accidents, and sharp object perforating injury. In 53 (80.3%) subjects in non-traumatic group the initial clinical diagnosis matched the histopathological results. Malignant tumors (retinoblastoma: 47.5%, malignant melanoma: 27.3%) were the most common pathological diagnoses followed by phthisis bulbi (25.8%). The most common procedure-related complications were major eye discharge (39.6%), and implant exposure and discharge (20.8%)., , , CONCLUSION, Trauma and malignant tumors are the leading causes of enucleation-evisceration. Despite developing new techniques and materials, enucleation is still associated with considerable postoperative complications.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8212293dedff7daf6a9fa3af965f78a7d000fb29

Data indeed by soon present deal.;Poster;Purpose: To evaluate, using MRI, the extent and pattern of fibrovascular ingrowth into Medpor implants after modified evisceration. Methods: Contrast T1-weighted images were performed in 21 patients within 1.5- to 69-month intervals after modified evisceration with primary Medpor implantation. In 6 patients, the images were obtained separately following 1- and 5-minute delays after contrast administration. Results: No grade I enhancement occurred in these series. Grade II was observed in 2 patients (9.09%), grade III in 8 patients (36.36%), grade IV in 9 patients (40.91%), and grade V in 3 patients (13.64%). Significant correlation existed between the grade of enhancement and the postevisceration interval (r = 0.483, p = 0.023 < 0.05). The images demonstrated an enhancement pattern that started at the unwrapped posterior pole and anterior location of rectus muscles with progressive centripetal vascularization toward the center of the implant. At the early stage of recovery, the fibrous connective tissue was thick in front of Medpor spheres. In the 5-minute delay images of 6 patients, 2 patients failed to exhibit further enhancement; 2 patients exhibited enlarged and homogeneous enhancement; and 2 patients revealed more intense enhancement patterns. The medical ethics committee of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center approved the study. Conclusions: Fibrovascular ingrowth into Medpor implants was satisfactory after the modified evisceration and correlated with the duration of the implants. The double layers of sclera effectively prevented the implant extrusion and exposure. The authors recommend waiting at least 5 minutes before obtaining MR images after contrast administration.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d607bb57e1e30377444191fb67fda6e2f7f5f4f1

Methods Retrospective, multicentre case series. A review of all cases undergoing orbital implant replacement with DFG between 2007 and 2013 was conducted at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC), USA, and St. Erik Eye Hospital, Sweden. Inclusion criteria included (1) chronic ASP >2 years and unresponsive to treatment, (2) absence of pathological or structural cause for pain established by socket examination and orbital imaging, and (3) minimum 12-month post-surgical follow-up. Results Six cases with chronic ASP were identified, four were post-enucleation and two were eviscerated at an average age of 45 years. The incidence of chronic ASP among enucleations at UIHC over a 6-year period was 0.7%. Indications for enucleation and evisceration included tumours and glaucoma. Intractable ASP had been present for an average of 11 years and persisted despite medical management. All patients were free of pain within 3 months of implant removal and DFG placement and remained pain free at an average 24 months following surgery. Conclusions Orbital implant replacement with DFG was effective at relieving chronic ASP, and pain resolution was sustained in all cases. This surgical intervention may be a useful management option for patients in whom all detectable causes of chronic pain have been excluded and have failed medical pain management.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0d84eb483da237978198960c3a363e259d16046

Book affect choice south tonight.;DemoPaper;Introduction: Aim of this systematic review was to assess the orthodontic related issues which currently provide the best evidence as documented by meta-analyses, by critically evaluating and discussing the methodology used in these studies. Material and Methods: Several electronic databases were searched and handsearching was also performed in order to identify the corresponding meta-analyses investigating orthodontic related subjects. In total, 197 studies were retrieved initially. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 27 articles were identified as meta-analyses treating orthodontic-related subjects. Results: Many of these 27 papers presented sufficient quality and followed appropriate meta-analytic approaches to quantitatively synthesize data and presented adequately supported evidence. However, the methodology used in some of them presented weaknesses, limitations or deficiencies. Consequently, the topics in orthodontics which currently provide the best evidence, include some issues related to Class II or Class III treatment, treatment of transverse problems, external apical root resorption, dental anomalies, such as congenital missing teeth and tooth transposition, frequency of severe occlusal problems, nickel hypersensitivity, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and computer-assisted learning in orthodontic education. Conclusions: Only a few orthodontic related issues have been so far investigated by means of MAs. In addition, for some of these issues investigated in the corresponding MAs no definite conclusions could be drawn, due to significant methodological deficiencies of these studies. According to this investigation, it can be concluded that at the begin of the 21st century there is evidence for only a few orthodontic related issues as documented by meta-analyses, and more well-conducted high quality research studies are needed to produce strong evidence in order to support evidence-based clinical practice in orthodontics.;Yes;No;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69dac543e6136cff0303517636eb1b9ffed0e13b

To evaluate oral fluoride (F) retention after using fluoridated toothpastes, rinsing solutions and chewing sticks (Miswaks) in orthodontic patients with and without orthodontic appliances. Material and methods. Nine orthodontic patients, with a mean age of 16 years, were included in a randomized, cross-over, experimental study. Six different home-care F products, two NaF toothpastes (0.32% and 1.1%), two NaF mouthwash solutions (0.05% and 0.2%) and two NaF-impregnated Miswaks chewing sticks (0.05% and 0.5%), were used both during the orthodontic treatment and 1 week after debonding. Unstimulated whole saliva and approximal saliva were collected from two interdental sites, before and up to 60 min after using each product for 2 min. The retention of F was calculated as the area under the 60-min F-clearance curve (AUC). Results. In general, the F concentrations at the various sites were higher before than after debonding. Moreover, the products with a high F content (toothpaste, mouthwash and Miswaks) resulted in higher F retention than the corresponding products with a lower F content. In whole saliva, the highest AUC values were found in patients using 0.2% NaF mouthwash, followed by 1.1% NaF toothpaste (p < 0.05). In approximal saliva, the retention values were highest after using 0.5% NaF-impregnated Miswaks in patients wearing orthodontic appliances (p < 0.001). Conclusions. The insertion of fixed orthodontic appliances appears to favor oral F retention for all the tested home-care F products. In addition, products with a high F content increase oral F retention.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6a7acd3d7e17a178073132be976933e6f1c1be7

Top benefit say idea apply., According teacher red.;Poster;Purpose We present clinical results of the use of the multipurpose conical porous synthetic orbital implant (MCOI) in surgical procedures of evisceration, enucleation, and secondary enucleation in ophthalmology patients. Methods A retrospective review was performed of 59 eyes in which conical implants were used, including 36 cases of eviscerations, 11 enucleations, and 9 secondary enucleations. In all of the cases, the follow-up period was greater than six months between 2004 and 2013. The results focus on documenting surgical findings, as well as postoperative complications among patients. Results Superior sulcus deformities were found in six eyes (10.2% of conical implant patients), and two eyes received additional surgical interventions to correct the deformities (3.4%). Blepharoptosis was found in four eyes (6.8%), two of which received upper eyelid blepharoplasty (3.4%). Fornix shortening was reported in only one eye (1.7%). Forty-one eyes had a satisfactory cosmetic appearance after the final prosthetic fitting of conical implants (69.5%). The most frequent postoperative complication was orbital implant exposure, which seemed to occur when the preoperative status of the conjunctiva, Tenon's capsule, and sclera preservation were poor in the eyes of the patients. Conclusions There was a lower incidence of blepharoptosis and fornix shortening with the MCOI in comparison to spherical implants, while the incidence of orbital implant exposure was similar with the MCOI in comparison to other types of orbital implants. In addition, the MCOI may have advantages with respect to postoperative cosmetic outcomes.;Yes;No;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/537e7de3dec4696b7857f76b696ca9a737338f71

Attack mention class fight help more.;DemoPaper;Several fluoride-releasing bonding materials are available for orthodontic bracket placement. These are supposed to prevent white spot lesions during therapy. The objectives of this in vitro study were to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) and failure mode of a recently introduced fluoride-releasing adhesive, as well as the comparison with established orthodontic adhesives. Sixty bovine mandibular incisors were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 20): stainless steel brackets were bonded with Transbond Plus Color Change Adhesive, Transbond XT, or Light Bond. A universal testing machine was used to determine the SBS at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. After debonding, the adhesive remnant index (ARI) was used to assess the adhesive remaining on the brackets. One-way analysis of variance comparing the three experimental groups showed no differences between the bonding systems for mean SBS (P = 0.27). ARI scores showed more residual adhesive on the teeth bonded with the Transbond systems (P < 0.01). As the fluoride-releasing bonding system provided sufficient mean bond strength in vitro (19.9 MPa), it may be used as an additional prophylactic measure in orthodontic therapy. However, the clinical effectiveness of its fluoride release may be questionable, as the amount of fluoride required from a bonding material to be caries preventive is still unknown.;No;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3e2d638e74caa33b75a29405e5c5a8886801ea0

There were 167 eyes (29.14%) being enucleated and 406 (70.86%) eviscerated. Annual proportion of evisceration rose from 16.67% in 1993 to 90.48% in later years. Trauma was the top one (65.62%) in original protopathies followed by neoplasm (13.44%) and ocular infections (5.76%). Phthisis bulbi (45.20%) was the most common direct indication, succeeded by malignant tumor (12.57%), loss/unreconstructed of intraocular tissues due to trauma (11.00%), untreatable inflammation (9.60%), intractable glaucoma (8.55%) and sclerocorneal staphyloma (5.24%). Exenteration was underwent in 20 (25.97%) cases (40% for recurrent carcinoma). Following evisceration, secondary prosthesis implantation was more and earlier, implant exposure occurred in less but earlier and infection and extraction/exchange of implants were more than those following enucleation. Male, phthisis bulbi, evisceration and secondary implantation meant lower risk of implant exposure; eyes removed within 24h following trauma was an independent risk factor. There were 14.37% of eyes with vision of light perception at least as been removed. In the residual contralateral eyes, low vision accounted 5.58% and blindness 3.14%., , , CONCLUSION, Ocular trauma, tumor and infections were great threats to eyeball preservation.

Brackets were bonded to 60 bovine incisors, using either Transbond Plus Color Change (n=30) or Orthodontic Fill Magic (n=30) orthodontic resins. Each group of resin was divided into 3 subgroups (n=10): immersion in remineralizing artificial saliva for 14 days, pH cycling with high cariogenic challenge in acid saliva with pH 5.5, and acid saliva with pH 4.5. After 14 days of pH cycling, the caries preventive effect on the development of white spot lesion was evaluated considering the presence of inhibition zones to white spot lesions using two scores: 0= absence and 1= presence. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (a=0.05) were used. Formation of white spot lesions was observed only under pH cycling using acid saliva with pH 4.5; with Transbond Plus Color Change being significantly more effective (p<0.05) in preventing the appearance of white spot lesions effect than Orthodontic Fill Magic.

Treatment objective is to stimulate sagittal mandible growth. Fixed functional Herbst appliance use is beneficial for shortening the time required for treatment and does not depend on patient compliance., , , CASE OUTLINE, A 13-year-old girl was referred to the Clinic of Orthodontics, School of Dentistry in Belgrade following previous unsuccessful treatment of her skeletal Class II malocclusion using an activator. The patient's poor cooperation had led to failure of the treatment. Patient was subjected to the Herbst treatment for 6 months followed by fixed appliance for another 8 months. Lateral cephalograms before and after the treatment was performed. The remodelation of condylar and fossal articulation was assessed by superimposition of pre- and post-treatment temporomandibular joint tomograms. The promotion of oral hygiene and fluoride use was performed because orthodontic treatment carries a high caries risk and risk for periodontal disease. Skeletal and dental changes were observed after treatment (correction [Max+Mand]: molar relation 7 mm, overjet 8 mm, skeletal relation 5 mm, molars 2 mm, incisors 3 mm).

The problem is becoming worse with the increasing prevalence of obesity. By 2050, the number of Americans with diabetic retinopathy is projected to triple from 5.5 million to 16 million, and visionthreatening retinopathy is projected to increase from 1.2 million to 3.4 million. The only proven medical therapy for diabetic retinopathy is control of blood glucose level and blood pressure, so it is crucial for ophthalmologists to identify patients at risk. In many cases the “ABCs” (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level, blood pressure values, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] levels) are not communicated between ophthalmologists and other primary care physicians, so patient understanding of these risk factors is crucial for proper management. Do et al investigated awareness of HbA1c, but to our knowledge no study has assessed all 3 levels. Therefore, the rationale for this study is to determine the proportion of ophthalmology patients with diabetes who know personal and recommended ABCs of diabetes care.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a30b54986ad39ccbef4bac342c7517fbeceb3a8

Design: Retrospective chart review in one surgeon's practice (J.D.N.). Methods: A chart review of all patients who underwent placement of PPE/BG orbital implants was performed. Data included patient's age, gender, surgical indication, prior ocular surgery, medical history, procedure performed, implant size, and postoperative complications. Results: PPE/BG implants were placed in 170 sockets. Seventy-seven patients were women, and 85 were men. One hundred forty patients underwent primary enucleation and placement of an implant, and 22 patients underwent secondary implantation. One hundred sixty-one patients did well after orbital implantation with a comfortable socket, quiet conjunctiva, and motility. Complications occurred in 9 patients (5.3%). Excessive discharge alone occurred in 2 patients (1.2%). Seven sockets undergoing primary enucleation and implant placement had implant exposure. One patient had an early exposure, and 6 had late exposures. All exposures were successfully treated with antibiotics or additional surgery. Secondary surgeries were required by some patients, but not due to implant complications, included ectropion repair in 5 patients (2.9%) and volume augmentation in 3 patients (1.7%).

Result per himself month.;DemoPaper;AbstractOrbital implant–associated complications always affect patients, resulting in multiple operations. One-stage replacement of complicated implants has been attractive for reducing operation times and preventing long-time appearance without artificial eye. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 1-stage replacement surgery of orbital implant. A total of 21 eyes in 21 cases with noninfectious complications, who failed conservative therapies and surgical repairs, were treated with 1-stage orbital implant replacement. After a detailed ophthalmic history was obtained and examinations performed, patients with apparent purulent secretion in conjunctival sac were excluded. The preexisting orbital implant was carefully removed, and a new hydroxyapatite sphere was implanted simultaneously. Wound healing status, prosthesis movement, and cosmetic features were evaluated and recorded after at least 6 months’ follow-up. Orbital implant exposure(16 cases) was the main indication of the replacement surgery; other causes included superior orbital area depression (2 cases), conjunctival fistula (1 case), orbital implant malposition (1 case), and the metal material of implant obstructing magnetic resonance imaging scan in 1 case. Eye-socket hollow was redressed in all cases immediately, and 95.23% cases (20/21) could wear an artificial eye and had a good cosmetic appearance, whereas conjunctival sac fistula reoccurred in 1 patient, and the implant was removed ultimately. Conjunctival sac constrictions occurred in 4 cases after operation and were treated by secondary conjunctival sac reconstruction 6 months later. In conclusion, 1-stage replacement of orbital implants offers an effective and efficient strategy for dealing with severe postimplantation noninfectious complications in achieving a symmetrically cosmetic appearance without delay.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/effc4fb485bbbf42a3ad6894f6026bbf3b9fb897

Abnormalities of PAX2, PAX3, PAX6, and PAX9 are associated with various congenital craniofacial anomalies, including tooth abnormalities. We present here a boy with oligodontia. Dental radiographs showed that he lacked primary molars and was missing most of his permanent teeth. A genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism–based microarray revealed a de novo 223-kb heterozygous deletion on 14q13.3 that included the PAX9 gene. The findings in this patient illustrate the role of the PAX9 gene in tooth development and provide the first example of a de novo deletion of 14q13.3 manifesting primarily with oligodontia. This report also supports the utility of genome-wide microarrays in determining the genetic cause of craniofacial abnormalities.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5dff1c9147527564147b71a32a08b7835dcd7c6

Hair while specific him itself benefit.;FullPaper;Dental caries on (proximal) tooth surfaces is still a problem in many industrialized countries. The objectives of this review were to present the scientific basis and the principles of the resin infiltration concept, to discuss the inherent clinical applications, and to describe how these backgrounds can be integrated into the concept of minimal intervention dentistry. Data were identified by searches of the Cochrane Registers, Medline, and Scopus. Articles published in English and German through December 2008 were selected, and most up-to-date or relevant references were chosen. Cross-referencing of significant articles identified additionally relevant articles written in other languages and those of historical value. A total of 23 in vitro studies (focusing on penetration depths or demineralization prevention) were found, and 3 clinical studies (involving 122 subjects) could be retrieved; these studies were not comparable. With an increased understanding of the caries process, it is now recognized that demineralized but noncavitated enamel lesions can be arrested or remineralized in many situations. The clinical research evidence on the resin infiltration technique currently is of moderate extent to reach any decisive conclusions; however, based on available laboratory and clinical studies, it seems convincing that resin infiltration of enamel lesions should reduce (or even stop) the progress of white spot lesions. Combining this ultraconservative restorative approach (which is considered microinvasive) with a substantial caries remineralization program may provide therapeutic benefits and significantly reduce both long-term restorative needs and costs, thus complementing the concept of minimal intervention dentistry.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd021c981f35f260d9aeee38192ece5524903511

The aim of the present study was to examine whether short-term consumption of fruit yogurt containing probiotic bifidobacteria would affect the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. A double-blind, randomized crossover study was performed and 24 healthy adolescents (12-16 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment were followed over four periods. During periods 2 and 4 (2 weeks each), the subjects ingested 200 g fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 (2 x 10(8) colony forming units/g) once daily or a control yogurt without viable bacteria. Periods 1 and 3 were run-in and wash-out periods of 1 and 6 weeks, respectively. Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits before and after the yogurt consumption periods. Pre- and post-treatment values within each regimen were compared with a two-tailed marginal homogeneity test for categorical data. A statistically significant reduction of salivary mutans streptococci was recorded after probiotic yogurt consumption (P < 0.05), which was in contrast to the control yogurt. No significant alterations of the salivary lactobacilli counts were observed. Short-term daily consumption of fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 may reduce the levels of mutans streptococci in saliva during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31f79b312e7a6b82d76ea6dd3a3d57077bfab75c

The sclerocorneal bag was sutured and filled with biopolymer from sugar cane in the gel state. All animals were clinically examined by biomicroscopy until the day of their sacrifice which occurred on the 7th, 30th, 60th, 90th, 120th, or 240th day. The eyeballs obtained, including the left eyes considered controls were sent for histopathological study by optical macroscopy and microscopy. Tissue staining techniques used included hematoxylin-eosin, Masson trichrome (with aniline), Gomori trichrome, Van Gienson, Picrosirius red, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)., , , RESULTS, No clinical signs of infection, allergy, toxicity, or extrusion were observed throughout the experiment. The corneas were relatively preserved. Macroscopic examination revealed a decrease of ~ 8% in the volume of the bulbs implanted with the biopolymer. After cutting, the sclerocorneal bag was solid, compact, elastic, and resistant to traction, with a smooth and whitish surface, and showed no signs of necrosis or liquefaction. The episcleral tissues were somewhat hypertrophied. The histological preparations studied in different colors revealed an initial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, replaced by a fibroblastic response and proliferation of histiocytes, along with formation of giant cells. Few polymorphonuclearneutrophils and eosinophils were also found. Neovascularization and collagen deposition were present in all animals starting from day 30; although on the 240th day of the experiment the chronic inflammatory response, neovascularization and collagen deposition had not yet reached the center of the implant., , , CONCLUSION, In this model, the cellulose gel produced by Zoogloea sp proved to be biocompatible and integrated into the orbits.

In a split-mouth-design, the four quadrants of each patient were either treated with ozone, a combination of Cervitec and Fluor Protector, or served as untreated controls. The visible plaque index (VPI) and white spot formation were analyzed clinically. DIAGNOdent and QLF were used for a quantitative assessment of white spot formation., , , RESULTS, The average VPI in all four dental arch quadrants amounted to 55.6% and was independent of the preventive measure undertaken. In the quadrants treated with Cervitec/Fluor Protector, only 0.7% of the areas developed new, clinically visible white spots. This was significantly (P < .05) less than in the quadrants treated with ozone (3.2%). The lesions detected with QLF only partially corresponded to the clinically detected white spots, while DIAGNOdent proved to be unable to detect any changes at all., , , CONCLUSIONS, The caries protective effect of Cervitec/Fluor Protector during MB therapy was superior to ozone, and a visual evaluation of initial caries lesions was superior to both DIAGNOdent and QLF.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/118f1f4e71ba8726c5247fac1ae381e46c811d5f

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 101 cases of evisceration, enucleation, or secondary implant surgery with placement of a bioceramic porous implant was conducted. Type of surgery, existence of a peg, peg system used, time of pegging, problems encountered before and after pegging, treatment methods, and final status were recorded. Results: Evisceration was performed on 74, enucleation on 16, and secondary implant surgery on 11 patients. The patients were observed for a mean of 68.4 months (3 months–12 years). Fifty-three of the 101 patients were pegged. Patients were pegged at a mean of 9.3 months (6–23 months). Hydroxyapatite-coated, titanium-sleeved, titanium pegs were used in 43 patients, and titanium peg and sleeve system was used in 10 patients. Major complications were exposure and infection. Three patients presented with early exposure and late exposure developed in 14 of pegged and 4 of unpegged patients. The difference in late-exposure rates between pegged and unpegged group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Implant infection developed in 9 of the pegged and in 1 of the unpegged patients. Implant exposure was noted in 6 of these 10 patients with infection. The difference in infection rates between the pegged and unpegged patients was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In 2 of the pegged patients, removal of bioceramic implant was required and after resolution of infection, another type of porous implant was implanted and repegged. The peg system was removed in 6 patients for the management of either exposure, infection, extrusion, hypermobility of sleeve, or peg falling out. Four patients were repegged. The time period between peg insertion and development of complications ranged from 15 days to 10 years. 86.8% of pegged patients were free of major complications and satisfied with the result at the last follow-up visit. Conclusion: Despite potential complications that can occur as late as 10 years, bioceramic porous implants yield satisfactory long-term results. Existence of a peg system appears to play a role in the increased rate of late-onset complications. Further investigations on new and safer pegging systems should be conducted.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9824fd2be9a2efb62fabf0dbd438a21e3d4fd9e3

Methods: Unwrapped, silicone-capped, porous, polyethylene orbital spheres were implanted in 16 enucleated rabbit orbits. Four implants were removed at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month intervals and submitted for histopathologic analysis. A board-certified pathologist reviewed and graded vascular ingrowth, inflammation type, and severity for all specimens. Results: Fibrovascular ingrowth in the center of all implants occurred as early as 3 months. No fibrovascular ingrowth occurred at the interface between the silicone cap and the porous polyethylene implant. The overlying Tenon’s and conjunctival tissues remained intact without significant host inflammatory response. No implant exposure occurred at any time point.

There is a considerable body of strong evidence supporting the use of specific techniques for primary prevention of caries in children, e.g. pit and fissure sealants and topically applied fluorides (including patient-applied fluoride toothpastes and professionally applied fluoride varnishes), but limited strong evidence for these techniques for secondary prevention--i.e. where early to established lesions with ICDAS codes 1-4 (and also the severer lesions coded 5 or 6) are involved--and in relation to adults. This lack of evidence reflects a shortage of high-quality trials in the area, as opposed to a series of good studies showing no effect. Since there is also limited longitudinal evidence supporting conventional operative care, and since controlling the caries process prior to first restoration is the key to breaking the repair cycle and improving care for patients, future research should address the shortcomings in the current level of supporting evidence for the various traditional preventive treatment options.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1671fb74650683f1823a5ec500d6e51a2890bae0

Patients with a congenital heart disease, patients who have received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and patients with stable chronic heart failure are also suitable candidates for a multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation programme. The new Dutch guidelines for cardiac rehabilitation, published in 2004, can be helpful in identifying potential candidates for a programme. Physical training is often a component of the treatment, but psycho-social counselling and education targeted at reducing anxiety and uncertainty, accepting the heart disease and learning to cope with it, can be just as important as those aspects targeted at improving the physical condition. Cardiac rehabilitation that includes physical training is safe for patients with congenital heart disease, for patients who have undergone an ICD implantation and for patients with stable chronic heart failure, as long as the pretraining exercise test is given a guiding role in selecting the appropriate physical work load. Patients with stable chronic heart failure should continue their physical training in order to maintain its beneficial physical and psychological effects.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/894d65c71c4d49d83131afcaed2164802f27f43d

Pm blue our.;DemoPaper;Although the past few decades have shown an improvement in the survival and complication-free survival rates in patients with beta-thalassemia major and gene therapy is already at an advanced stage of experimentation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) continues to be the only effective and realistic approach to the cure of this chronic non-malignant disease. Historically, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings have been the preferred source of donor cells owing to superior outcomes compared with HSCT from other sources. Nowadays, the availability of an international network of voluntary stem cell donor registries and cord blood banks has significantly increased the odds of finding a suitable HLA matched donor. Stringent immunogenetic criteria for donor selection have made it possible to achieve overall survival (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS) rates comparable to those of sibling transplants. However, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains the most important complication in unrelated HSCT in thalassemia, leading to significant rates of morbidity and mortality for a chronic non-malignant disease. A careful immunogenetic assessment of donors and recipients makes it possible to individualize appropriate strategies for its prevention and management. This review provides an overview of recent insights about immunogenetic factors involved in GVHD, which seem to have a potential role in the outcome of transplantation for thalassemia.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec6be0821240c42097dca950a3acd1fcf917d052

Scanning electron microscopy was used to qualitatively evaluate the tie-wing intact and fractured surfaces., , , RESULTS, A two-way analysis of variance and Fisher-Hayter post hoc test, alpha = .05, indicated a significant decrease in tie-wing fracture strength following both fluoride treatments when compared with the distilled water control only with the monocrystalline bracket. None of the bracket brands exhibited any qualitative differences in the tie-wing intact or fracture surfaces as a function of fluoride treatment., , , CONCLUSIONS, The hypothesis is rejected. Based on the results, using topical fluoride agents with monocrystalline brackets might be contraindicated because of increased tie-wing fracture susceptibility.;Yes;No;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/063b33987a3a1ed5d752039e5f0c743385ef3d17

At baseline, the lightness of maxillary incisors and canines was assessed with a colorimeter. Color determinations were performed in the area of the initial lesions (F1) and at adjacent, sound enamel areas (F2). Then, anterior teeth were bleached once with a bleaching gel for 60 minutes. After a break of 14 days, in-office bleaching was followed by a 2-week home bleaching period with daily home bleaching for 1 hour. After this, color determinations were repeated. Additionally, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire to provide information about their degree of contentment with the treatment., , , RESULTS, The lightness values of both the F1 and F2 regions were significantly higher after bleaching as compared with baseline. F2 L-values increased significantly more as compared with F1, indicating a better color matching of these two areas in comparison with baseline. All patients were satisfied with the outcome of the bleaching therapy., , , CONCLUSION, External bleaching is able to satisfactorily camouflage WSLs visible after therapy with fixed orthodontic appliances.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03b486a8e11b3b145669da068f586a64f540684b

Knowledge stand once not name day city clearly. Few property usually toward generation.;DemoPaper;The aim of this study was to monitor, by means of quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF), the natural behaviour of white spot lesions detected immediately after orthodontic treatment and 2 years post-treatment. The buccal tooth surfaces of 51 subjects (>or=12 years), 24 males and 27 females, were examined with QLF for the presence of caries immediately after debonding (T0), and 6 weeks (T1), 6 months (T2), and 2 years (T3) thereafter. The fluorescence loss [Delta F (per cent)] and area [A (mm(2))] of any lesions were determined using dedicated software. The lesion development and influence of gender were determined by a general linear model (Friedman repeated-measures analysis and two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance). Using QLF, 370 carious surfaces were recorded at T0. During the study, 19 lesions were lost from QLF analysis of which 16 lesions (Delta F(0)=7.6-39.2 per cent) in two subjects were restored and three teeth with lesions were extracted or crowned. This resulted in 351 lesions that were included in this study with a median Delta F at T0 of 8.5 per cent (quartiles 6.6 per cent; 11.9 per cent). The lesions varied from incipient (Delta F<10 per cent, n=227) to advanced (Delta F>25 per cent, n=6). Overall, the lesions showed improvement between T0 and T2 (P<0.01) but no further significant improvement at T3. Thirty-five lesions became significantly worse after 2 years. The majority of lesions (n=171) were considered to be stable, and 145 lesions improved significantly of which only 10 lesions improved to such an extent that they disappeared. White spot lesions developed during orthodontic treatment have very limited ability to improve after appliance removal. Further research to investigate the potential of preventive measures to enhance lesion improvement is necessary.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf7646a56782eeb0882587471d2d16b4ce0e47a5

Methods: This is a retrospective, clinical case series of 419 patients who received a bioceramic orbital implant. All patients who presented to five oculofacial surgeons (D.J., S.G., J.D., S.K., L.M.) from January 1, 2000, to June 1, 2007, who received a bioceramic orbital implant and had a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were included in this study. The authors analyzed age, gender, type of surgery, implant size, peg system, follow-up duration, time of pegging, and problems encountered. The data from the patients with greater than 3 months of follow-up with exposure of the bioceramic implant are detailed in this report. Results: There were 353 patients followed for 3 to 96 months with an average of 30 months of follow-up (median 23 months). Implant exposure occurred in 32/353 bioceramic implants (9.1%). Six of the 32 (19%) exposures occurred during the 90-day postoperative period (average 2.1 months). Twenty-six (81%) exposures occurred outside of the 90-day postoperative period (average 27.5 months, range 4–82 months). Conclusions: Implant exposures can occur anytime postimplant placement. This review discovered an implant exposure rate of 9.1%, with the majority of the exposures occurring after the postoperative follow-up period. Patients with porous orbital implants should be followed on a long-term basis to detect this complication.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d3023367456fd97e990ca85e922c331b5efb1a7

Community herself truth. Enjoy brother language company market church.;DemoPaper;The enhanced risk of dental caries is one negative side-effect of fixed appliances. A new antimicrobial and fluoride-releasing self-etching bonding system (Clearfil Protect Bond) has been introduced in restorative dentistry and clinical studies have already shown the potential for this primer to be used clinically with effective antiplaque properties. Therefore, this in vitro study was conducted in order to evaluate the new primer in comparison with a conventional bonding preparation. One hundred and twenty extracted human teeth were randomly divided into three groups of 40 specimens each (20 incisors, 20 premolars). In group 1 a conventional bonding procedure was used (etching, Transbond XT), in group 2 the new primer was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations when bonding to intact enamel, while in group 3 the new primer was used without prior etching. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured with a universal testing machine and the adhesive remaining after debonding was determined using an optical microscope at x10 magnification. The adhesive remnant index was used in order to assess the mode of failure. No enamel fractures were detected in any of the specimens. In all groups acceptable bond strengths were observed. The only statistically significant difference (P = 0.004) was found for the incisors in group 2, which showed the highest mean SBS (17.46 MPa). Considering the acceptable bond strength and the mode of failure, use of the new primer without prior etching is recommended in patients with fixed appliances. Further in vivo studies will be carried out in order to evaluate clinical performance.;Yes;Yes;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d8fbc2e74ad2e3409fd64a3efd8cb8a5fd5507d3

Feel that growth.;FullPaper;Background. Stable angina pectoris with moderate coronary artery lesions is a syndrome caused by coronary artery stenosis, which endangers the quality of life. Previous acupuncture studies have shown effectiveness as a complementary therapy for ischaemic heart disease. However, more clinical evidence is needed for verification, and the mechanism should be investigated, especially involving the functional interactions between the heart and brain. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial to provide more evidence for acupuncture efficacy and its mechanism in ischaemic heart disease. Methods/Design. A total of 80 participants will be randomized to the electroacupuncture group and sham-electroacupuncture group at a ratio of 1 : 1. This trial will be conducted over 8 weeks, including a 2-week screening, 2-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up. All participants will continue to receive similar basic disease treatment procedures before the trial (including lifestyle changes and treatment for standard supportive medications, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia, such as aspirin, metoprolol succinate, atorvastatin, and sodium fosinopril). Additionally, 12 sessions of acupuncture will be administered during the treatment period. The main outcome is Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. The other observation indices are the heart rate variability and self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale scores. To explore mechanisms based on the hypothesis of a correlation between heart and brain function, fMRI scans will be used to detect functional brain changes in 15 patients from each group at baseline and at the end of treatment. Finally, the efficacy of acupuncture will be evaluated, and the HRV and imaging data will be correlated with clinical data to investigate the possible relationships between the brain and heart activity. Discussion. This trial will provide evidence for acupuncture as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of stable angina pectoris with moderate coronary artery lesions. The results will shed light on potential mechanisms of heart-brain interactions underlying acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy for treating ischaemic heart disease.

These programmes were designed to stimulate permanent adoption of a heart-healthy lifestyle. The primary outcome was the SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk function at 18 months follow-up. Methods In total, 914 patients with ACS (age, 57 years; 81% men) were randomised to: (1) 3 months standard CR (CR-only); (2) standard CR including three additional face-to-face active lifestyle counselling sessions and extended with three group fitness training and general lifestyle counselling sessions in the first 9 months after standard CR (CR+F); or (3) standard CR extended for 9 months with five to six telephone general lifestyle counselling sessions (CR+T). Results In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no difference in the SCORE risk function at 18 months between CR+F and CR-only (3.30% vs 3.47%; p=0.48), or CR+T and CR-only (3.02% vs 3.47%; p=0.39). In a per-protocol analysis, two of three modifiable SCORE parameters favoured CR+F over CR-only: current smoking (13.4% vs 21.3%; p<0.001) and total cholesterol (3.9 vs 4.3 mmol/L; p<0.001). The smoking rate was also lower in CR+T compared with the CR-only (12.9% vs 21.3%; p<0.05). Conclusions Extending CR with extra behavioural counselling (group sessions or individual telephone sessions) does not confer additional benefits with respect to SCORE parameters. Patients largely reach target levels for modifiable risk factors with few hospital readmissions already following standard CR.

The Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox regression analysis were applied to study differences in survival. During follow-up, a total of 335 (14.5%) patients had died. Cumulative mortality rates at 5 and 10 years were 6.4% and 14.7% after CR and 10.4% and 23.5% in the no CR group (P < 0.001). Cardiac rehabilitation patients had 39% lower mortality than non-CR controls [10-year mortality 14.7% vs. 23.5%; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.81]. A total of 915 (78.9%) patients completed CR and had 46% lower mortality than those who did not complete CR (10-year mortality 13.6% vs. 18.9%; adjusted HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42-0.70)., , , Conclusion, Patients who underwent pPCI for ACS, with a CR program had lower mortality than their non-CR counterparts. Mortality was particularly low in patients who completed the program. In conclusion, CR is still beneficial in terms of survival.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d5dce38e5b92fe1d5a21e33ece1b53e5b31940b

Music evening by song economic both.;ShortPaper;BACKGROUND, Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (dental braces) to correct the positions of teeth. It has been shown that the quality of treatment result obtained with fixed appliances is much better than with removable appliances. Fixed appliances are, therefore, favoured by most orthodontists for treatment. The success of a fixed orthodontic appliance depends on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being attached securely to the teeth so that they do not become loose during treatment. Brackets are usually attached to the front and side teeth, whereas bands (metal rings that go round the teeth) are more commonly used on the back teeth (molars). A number of adhesives are available to attach bands to teeth and it is important to understand which group of adhesives bond most reliably, as well as reducing or preventing dental decay during the treatment period., , , OBJECTIVES, To evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bands to teeth during fixed appliance treatment, in terms of:(1) how often the bands come off during treatment; and(2) whether they protect the banded teeth against decay during fixed appliance treatment., , , SEARCH METHODS, The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (searched 2 June 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library (searched 2 June 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 2 June 2016) and EMBASE Ovid (1980 to 2 June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) (including split-mouth studies) of adhesives used to attach orthodontic bands to molar teeth were selected. Patients with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) who had bands attached to molars were included., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, All review authors were involved in study selection, validity assessment and data extraction without blinding to the authors, adhesives used or results obtained. All disagreements were resolved by discussion., , , MAIN RESULTS, Five RCTs and three CCTs were identified as meeting the review's inclusion criteria. All the included trials were of split-mouth design. Four trials compared chemically cured zinc phosphate and chemically cured glass ionomer; three trials compared chemically cured glass ionomer cement with light cured compomer; one trial compared chemically cured glass ionomer with a chemically cured glass phosphonate.

Data bed property music watch walk federal.;Against hear stock ten meet customer.;FullPaper;Abstract Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) class and physical activity and sedentary behavior in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Methods This study was a secondary analysis of the OPTICARE trial. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured in participants with ACS (n = 359) using actigraphy at baseline, directly after completion of a multidisciplinary 12-week exercise-based CR program and 9 months thereafter. Outcome measures were step count and duration of time (percentage of wear time) spent in light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Participants were classified as normal weight (BMI = 18.5–24.99 kg/m2; n = 82), overweight (BMI = 25.0–29.99 kg/m2; n = 182), or obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2; n = 95). Linear mixed-effects models were applied to study the relationship between BMI class and physical activity and sedentary behavior. Results At the start of CR, compared with participants with normal weight, participants with obesity made on average 1.11 steps fewer per minute (952 steps/d), spent 2.9% (25 min/d) less time in light physical activity, and spent 3.31% (28 min/d) more time in sedentary behavior. Participants of all BMI classes improved their physical activity and sedentary behavior levels similarly during CR, and these improvements were maintained after completion of CR. Conclusion Participants with ACS who had obesity started CR with a less favorable physical activity and sedentary behavior profile than that of participants with normal weight. Because all BMI classes showed similar improvement during CR, this deficit was preserved. Impact This study indicates that reconsideration of the CR program in the Netherlands for patients with ACS and obesity is warranted, and development of more inclusive interventions for specific populations is needed. A new program for people with obesity should include added counseling on increasing physical activity and preventing sedentary behavior to facilitate weight loss and reduce mortality risk. Lay Summary People with ACS who have obesity are less active and sit more than individuals with normal weight, both during and after CR. This study suggests that CR needs to be changed to help individuals increase their physical activity to help them lose weight and reduce their risk of death.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4480adff791da44e224d1556d36d292640dcb2fc

Shear-peel bond strength was determined with a universal testing machine, and groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance. The amount of cement remaining on the teeth after band removal was scored, and a chi-square test was used to compare groups. Fatigue testing was conducted in a ball mill, and a log-rank test was used to compare differences in survival times., , , RESULTS, No differences were found in mean shear-peel bond strength among the three groups. The amount of cement remaining on the teeth varied between the compomer and GIC groups (P = .01), with more compomer cement remaining relative to GIC. The mean survival times of bands cemented with compomer or RMGIC were longer than for bands cemented with GIC (P < .001)., , , CONCLUSION, The findings show that on porcelain teeth the band cements have comparable mean shear-peel bond strengths, but that band retention with RMGIC and compomer cement are superior to GIC when subjected to simulated mechanical fatigue.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8cc62f01390e45ab4fba3f45e26ead42e0cd20a

Additionally, the fracture site after debonding was assessed using the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI). Eighty freshly extracted human premolars were used. Twenty teeth were randomly assigned to each of four groups: (1) brackets bonded with Transbond XT with a Transbond Plus etching primer and debonded within 5 minutes; (2) brackets bonded with Fuji Ortho LC and debonded within 5 minutes; (3) brackets bonded as for group 1 and debonded within 15 minutes; (4) brackets bonded as for group 2 and debonded within 15 minutes. The SBS of each sample was determined with an Instron machine. The mean SBS were, respectively: (1) 8.8 +/- 2 MPa; (2) 6.6 +/- 2.5 MPa; (3) 11 +/- 1.6 MPa and (4) 9.6 +/- 1.6 MPa. Interpolating the cumulative fracture probability by means of a Weibull analysis, the 10 per cent probabilities of fracture for the groups were found to be attained for shear stresses of 6.1, 3.1, 8.3 and 7.1 MPa, respectively. Chi-square testing of the ARI scores revealed that the nature of the remnant did not vary significantly with time, but the type of bonding material could generally be distinguished in leaving more or less than 10 per cent of bonding material on the tooth. After debonding, the Transbond system was likely to leave adhesive on at least 10 per cent of the bonded area of the tooth. The present findings indicate that brackets bonded with either Transbond XT in combination with Transbond Plus etching primer and Fuji Ortho LC had adequate bond strength at 5 minutes and were even stronger 15 minutes after initial bonding.;Yes;Yes;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87ed2fc9e646fe04b01a3a5f4722e97264d2ef79

Stressed and unstressed samples were tested in tension and the stress at which initial cement failure recorded. The mode of failure was recorded using an adhesive remnant evaluation. Results The mean band retention stresses offered by the cements studied ranged from 0.96 to 1.56 MPa. Fuji OrthoTM provided the highest mean band retention stress in ‘stressed’ (1.56 MPa) and ‘unstressed’ (1.45 MPa) states. Exposure to mechanical stress did not appear to significantly influence band retention or mode of cement failure for most cements. Fuji OrthoTM cement recorded the highest Weibull modulus for all cements tested. Virtually all samples failed at either the cement/enamel or cement band interface. Conclusions Significant differences in band displacement stress values and mode of failure were demonstrated between the cements studied. However, generic comparisons were difficult to make.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5966df387c8f88160d8d95a075f47a4579c0e376

The survival time of bands was also assessed following simulated mechanical stress in a ball mill. One hundred and twenty molar bands were cemented to extracted human third molars. Eighty bands (20 cemented with each cement) were used to assess the debonding force and 40 bands (10 cemented with each cement) were used to determine survival time. The specimens were prepared in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions for each cement. After storage in a humidor at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, the shear debonding force was assessed for each specimen using a Nene M3000 testing machine with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. The predominant site of band failure was recorded visually for all specimens as either at the band/cement or cement/enamel interface. Survival time was assessed following application of mechanical stress in a ball mill. There was no significant difference in mean shear-peel bond strength between the cement groups (P = 0.816). The proportion of specimens failing at each interface differed significantly between cement groups (P < 0.001). The predominant site of bond failure for bands cemented with the RMGIC (Fuji Ortho LC) or the modified composite was at the enamel/cement interface, whereas bands cemented with 3M Multi-Cure failed predominantly at the cement/band interface. Conventional GIC specimens failed mostly at the enamel/cement interface. The mean survival time of bands cemented with either of the RMGICs or with the modified composite was significantly longer than for those cemented with the conventional GIC. The findings indicate that although there appears to be equivalence in the mean shear-peel bond strength of the band cements assessed, the fatigue properties of the conventional GIC when subjected to simulated mechanical stress seem inferior to those of the other cements for band cementation.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d489942748b9ee9a63a2289f3132fdbcbacaaa9

Brackets were bonded to 30 premolars with each bonding system. The bonding time was recorded for each specimen using a stopwatch. After storage in a humidor at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, the shear debonding force was measured at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/minute. Another 10 premolars were bonded with each bonding system and used to assess survival time following the application of mechanical stress in a ball mill for 100 hours. The mean bonding time of the SEP group (111.5 seconds) was significantly less than that of the two-stage bonding group (170.5 seconds) [mean difference 59 seconds; 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 51.8-66.2 seconds, two sample t-test P < 0.001]. The mean shear bond strength of the SEP group (2.88 MPa) was significantly less than that of the two-stage bonding group (3.71 MPa) (mean difference 0.83 MPa; 95 per cent CI 0.23-1.42 MPa; two sample t-test P = 0.008). For the survival study, only one of the two-stage bonding group failed within 1 hour in the ball mill. The SEP significantly reduced bracket bonding time. The mean shear bond strength of the brackets bonded with the SEP was significantly less than those bonded with a conventional two-stage etch and prime system.

The mode of band failure and amount of cement remaining on the tooth at deband were also assessed. Finally, survival time of bands with each cement was assessed with simulated mechanical stress in a ball mill. Ninety banded specimens were used to assess retentive strength, and another 30 banded specimens were used to assess survival time. The mean retentive strength of the modified composite (0.415 MPa) was significantly less than that of either the resin-modified (1.715 MPa) or the conventional glass ionomer cement (1.454 MPa; P <.001). Specimens failed predominantly at the cement-enamel interface. The amount of cement remaining on the tooth at deband differed significantly between bands cemented with the resin-modified cement and those cemented with the conventional glass ionomer cement (P <.05). Mean survival time of bands cemented with the resin-modified glass ionomer cement (14.3 hours) was significantly longer (P <.01) than for bands cemented with the conventional glass ionomer cement (9.9 hours) but did not differ significantly from that of bands cemented with the modified composite (11.1 hours; P >.05). Orthodontic bands cemented with the modified composite appear to have a significantly lower mean retentive strength than bands cemented with resin-modified or conventional glass ionomer cement, but mean survival time did not differ significantly for bands cemented with modified composite or resin-modified glass ionomer.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ada43f0c73f52484ff96c05384146f762f3f69c

Collection manager loss main community Congress trade.;ShortPaper;Despite the advent of bonded attachments, preformed stainless steel bands are still routinely utilized in fixed appliance therapy. Banding offers superior reliability due to better resistance to occlusal interferences (Fricker, 1997). Band cements are necessary for band retention, either by assisting mechanical retention or by true adhesion. They also serve to seal a band to a tooth, filling the irregular gaps to prevent stagnation areas. Zinc phosphate cement was widely used for band cementation for much of the last century. It has high compressive strength, but suffers from low tensile strength and high solubility, resulting in micro-leakage and demineralisation. Zinc polycarboxylate cements were introduced to orthodontics in the early 1970s and offered the advantage of chemical adherence to enamel. However, physical and handling properties were flawed, due to poor tensile bond strength, solubility, viscosity, and short working time. Both zinc phosphate and polycarboxylate cements have been superceded by new generations of adhesive cements, and are now largely obsolete as banding cements.;Yes;Yes;2000;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4602fca6dca77d5b88fc26904785289a3f6f23d

The shear bond strength of four composite resins used to attach mesh-backed orthodontic brackets was measured at 24 hours and following mechanical insult in the ball-mill. Analysis of variance and an SNK range test showed that at 24 hours Dual-cured Porcelite® gave a significantly higher mean bond strength than the other materials (P<0·05).

Design Multi-centre randomized clinical trial. Setting One District General Hospital Orthodontic Department and two Specialist Orthodontic Practices. Participants Orthodontic patients aged between 10 and 18 years old, randomly allocated to either receive molar bands (n = 40) or molar bonds (n = 40). Method Bands were cemented with a conventional glass ionomer cement and tubes were bonded with light-cured composite to all four first permanent molar teeth for each subject. Attachments were reviewed at each recall appointment to assess loosening or loss. The clinical end point of the trial was the day of appliance debond. Enamel demineralization at debond was assessed using the modified International Caries Assessment and Detection System (ICDAS). Results The first time failure rate for molar bonds was 18·4% and 2·6% for molar bands (P = 0·0002). Survival analysis demonstrated molar bonds were more likely to fail compared with molar bands. First permanent molars with bonded tubes experienced more demineralization than those with cemented bands (P = 0·027). There was no statistically significant difference in discomfort experienced by patients after banding or bonding first permanent molars (P>0·05).

Thirty-one subjects underwent in vivo testing to compare the failure rate of bands cemented using the test cement and bands cemented using a conventional glass polyalkenoate cement (Ketac-Cem) over a 6-month period at the beginning of active appliance therapy. In an ex vivo experiment 60 extracted teeth were banded using either the test cement or a glass polyalkenoate cement, and subjected to a debanding force using a Lloyd universal testing machine until failure. In the in vivo study the overall proportion of failure of the bands cemented with each cement was identical at 0.048. However, in the ex vivo study the probability of failure for the glass polyphosphonate cement was significantly higher than for the glass polyalkenoate cement, and the force to deband the glass polyalkenoate cement was greater than that of the glass polyphosphonate cement. In the clinical setting the new glass polyphosphonate cement performed as well as a conventional glass polyalkenoate cement, and these results suggest that it could be used as an alternative cement for orthodontic banding.

The 3 orthodontic cement groups and the nonbanded control group were evaluated for cariopreventive potential. One hundred twenty extracted human molars were selected for banding, embedded in resin blocks, and randomly assigned to the following 4 groups: zinc phosphate cement, zinc polycarboxylate cement, resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), and nonbanded control. Orthodontic bands were placed and cemented; specimens were stored in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 30 days, thermocycled for 24 hours, and then debanded with a customized band-removal device attached to a universal testing machine. The cement was hand removed, and 2 coats of nail varnish were applied to the teeth, leaving a 2 x 2-mm window exposed on the buccal surface of the mesiobuccal cusp. The teeth were stored in lactic acid-gelatin solution for 4 weeks at 37 degrees C to develop simulated white spot decalcification in the window. The teeth were subjected to dye (10% methylene blue) for 24 hours and then sectioned through the window. The depth of dye penetration was determined and used as a measure of the cariopreventive effect of the banding cement. Data were analyzed with a 1-way ANOVA and a Tukey test for the multiple comparisons. Dye penetration occurred as follows: the zinc phosphate and control groups were about the same; there was less dye penetration with the zinc polycarboxylate, and the least with the resin-modified glass ionomer. The 2 fluoride-releasing cements (zinc polycarboxylate and RMGI) demonstrated less demineralization than the zinc phosphate in vitro and might provide greater protection from demineralization around a band periphery in clinical settings.;Yes;Yes;2002;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73fcb6076eff279a326cc56796bd876c18e44617

The effect of patient sex, patient age at the start of treatment, the presenting malocclusion, treatment mechanics, and the operator proficiency on band survival was also assessed. Data for 219 bands cemented with Band-Lok in 108 patients and for 395 bands cemented with AquaCem in 183 patients were analyzed. For each case, a single molar band, either the band that was first to fail or the band that had the shortest follow-up time, was chosen for analysis. For each cement, whether headgear was used or not, there was no significant difference in time to first band failure (P = .398). Twenty-six percent of patients had at least one band failure with Band-Lok, and 30% of patients had at least one band failure with AquaCem, representing an 18% band failure rate for each cement. There was no significant difference in time to first band failure for either cement with respect to sex of the patient (P = .842), patient age at the start of treatment (P = .257), presenting malocclusion (P = .319), or operator proficiency (P = .062). The use of headgear, however, reduced significantly the time to first band failure irrespective of cement type (P = .0069).

One hundred forty band pairs were cemented in 98 subjects. Overall band failure rates of 5% and 2.8% were recorded for the modified composite and the conventional glass ionomer, respectively, with no significant difference found between their times to first band failure. At the end-of-treatment deband, the position of band failure was predominantly at the enamel-cement interface for the modified composite and at the band-cement interface for the conventional glass ionomer (P <.001).

Agree among middle mention might but Mr begin.;Poster;In yeast, SIR2 overexpression or calorie restriction (CR) results in life-span extension. It was previously suggested that CR activates Sir2 by reducing the levels of Sir2 inhibitors, NADH, or nicotinamide. Whereas NADH reduction is associated with an increase in respiration, nicotinamide clearance is induced by the upregulation of PNC1. Here, we show that, consistent with the hormesis hypothesis, PNC1 is part of a transcriptional stress response module consisting of 39 genes that increases under various stresses. Under high CR (0.1% glucose), Pnc1 becomes activated and its levels increase. However, low CR (0.5% glucose) increases yeast life span without PNC1 induction or activation of any transcriptional stress response. Instead, microarray analysis of low CR shows that the messenger RNA levels of iron transport genes increase, suggesting that this mode of CR is regulated by a shift toward respiration and lowering NADH levels. Thus, at least two pathways regulate the CR response in yeast.;No;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a44e6bb3fbb411122826847f5a2de0436ede05d6

Modification of the band surface may improve clinical performance by increasing the mechanical interlock at this junction. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the retention of micro-etched and untreated first molar orthodontic bands in a randomized, half-mouth trial. Seventy-nine patients had 304 bands cemented as part of routine fixed appliance therapy. The effect of micro-etching, patient age and gender, operator, molar crossbite, treatment mechanics, and arch on band failure was investigated. Failure rates and survival times were compared for each variable assessed. Micro-etched molar bands showed a significant reduction in clinical failure rate over untreated molar bands and an increase in mean survival time (P < 0.001). Of the other variables examined, only the presence of a molar crossbite had any significant effect on band failure (P = 0.004).;Yes;Yes;2001;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bca3cf756eb83f6f9ecbcd970b576ea5b1ba2a64

Someone body small.;Poster;The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is an evolutionarily conserved key regulator of eukaryotic cell growth and proliferation. Recently, it has been reported that inhibition of TOR signaling pathway can delay aging and extend lifespan in several eukaryotic organisms, but how lifespan extension is mediated by inhibition of TOR signaling is poorly understood. Here we report that rapamycin treatment and nitrogen starvation, both of which cause inactivation of TOR complex 1 (TORC1), lead to enhanced association of Sir2 with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TORC1 inhibition increases transcriptional silencing of RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene integrated at the rDNA locus and reduces homologous recombination between rDNA repeats that causes formation of toxic extrachromosomal rDNA circles. In addition, TORC1 inhibition induces deacetylation of histones at rDNA. We also found that Pnc1 and Net1 are required for enhancement of association of Sir2 with rDNA under TORC1 inhibition. Taken together, our findings suggest that inhibition of TORC1 signaling stabilizes the rDNA locus by enhancing association of Sir2 with rDNA, thereby leading to extension of replicative lifespan in S. cerevisiae.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82c8268e70ced46414b40cbc447f4656aab4fd95

Indicate it push.;FullPaper;The objective of this study was to compare the shear-peel band strength of 5 orthodontic cements using both factory and in-office micro-etched bands. The 5 orthodontic cements evaluated were a zinc phosphate (Fleck's Cement), 2 resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGI)(3M Multicure glass ionomer and Optiband), and 2 polyacid-modified composite resin cements (PMCR)(Transbond Plus and Ultra Band Lok). Salivary contamination was examined with a polyacid-modified composite resin (Transbond Plus). Two hundred and eighty extracted human molar teeth were embedded in resin blocks and each was randomly assigned to the following 7 groups: 6 groups with factory etched bands, 5 cement groups and salivary contaminated group, and 1 in-office micro-etched group. The cemented teeth were put in deionized water at 37 degrees C for 30 days and thermocycled for 24 hours. The force required to break the cement bond was used as a measure of shear-peel band retention. With the use of an Instron testing machine, a shear-peel load was applied to each cemented band. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey test for the multiple comparisons. The RMGIs and PMCRs demonstrated significantly greater shear-peel band strengths compared to the zinc phosphate cement. No statistically significant differences were noted between the RMGI cement and PMCR cements and within the RMGI groups, however, there was a statistically significant difference within the PMCR groups. Significantly lower band strengths were noted with the saliva contaminated PMCR cement group (Transbond Plus) and the inpractice sandblasted PMCR group. Both RMGIs and PMCRs were found to demonstrate favorable banding qualities. The lower band strength with saliva-contaminated bands suggests that moisture control is critical when using a PMCR. The variability noted in the in-office micro-etched bands might be technique related.;Yes;No;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb7f20d7f75b6abf7ac7c8fc0b789e0e76a3d6c5

Haigneré;Impact reveal old. Attorney industry message off surface arrive. Hour receive oil drop president hospital country nearly.;Agree politics opportunity summer without figure charge. Game around fast good. Standard better trouble member join article partner.;ShortPaper;Nicotinamidases are metabolic enzymes that hydrolyze nicotinamide to nicotinic acid. These enzymes are widely distributed across biology, with examples found encoded in the genomes of Mycobacteria, Archaea, Eubacteria, Protozoa, yeast, and invertebrates, but there are none found in mammals. Although recent structural work has improved our understanding of these enzymes, their catalytic mechanism is still not well understood. Recent data show that nicotinamidases are required for the growth and virulence of several pathogenic microbes. The enzymes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans regulate life span in their respective organisms, consistent with proposed roles in the regulation of NAD(+) metabolism and organismal aging. In this work, the steady state kinetic parameters of nicotinamidase enzymes from C. elegans, Sa. cerevisiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (a pathogen responsible for human pneumonia), Borrelia burgdorferi (the pathogen that causes Lyme disease), and Plasmodium falciparum (responsible for most human malaria) are reported. Nicotinamidases are generally efficient catalysts with steady state k(cat) values typically exceeding 1 s(-1). The K(m) values for nicotinamide are low and in the range of 2 -110 μM. Nicotinaldehyde was determined to be a potent competitive inhibitor of these enzymes, binding in the low micromolar to low nanomolar range for all nicotinamidases tested. A variety of nicotinaldehyde derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors in kinetic assays. Inhibitions are consistent with reaction of the universally conserved catalytic Cys on each enzyme with the aldehyde carbonyl carbon to form a thiohemiacetal complex that is stabilized by a conserved oxyanion hole. The S. pneumoniae nicotinamidase can catalyze exchange of (18)O into the carboxy oxygens of nicotinic acid with H(2)(18)O. The collected data, along with kinetic analysis of several mutants, allowed us to propose a catalytic mechanism that explains nicotinamidase and nicotinic acid (18)O exchange chemistry for the S. pneumoniae enzyme involving key catalytic residues, a catalytic transition metal ion, and the intermediacy of a thioester intermediate.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80801cca6e8a64652a8d071f16917675ae0f8af4

To achieve this goal, we have been studying mechanisms of mammalian aging and longevity, focusing on the physiological importance of the mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 and systemic NAD biosynthesis mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase for the regulation of metabolism and aging. Through these studies, we have recently proposed a comprehensive concept of a novel systemic regulatory network for metabolism and aging, named “NAD World.” This new concept of NAD World also conveys ideas of functional hierarchy and frailty for the induction of aging in mammals.

Single try suffer travel mission.;ShortPaper;ABSTRACT Genes encoding thiamine biosynthesis enzymes in microorganisms are tightly regulated such that low environmental thiamine concentrations activate transcription and high concentrations are repressive. We have determined that multiple thiamine (THI) genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also regulated by the intracellular NAD+ concentration via the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hst1 and, to a lesser extent, Sir2. Both of these HDACs associate with a distal region of the affected THI gene promoters that does not overlap with a previously defined enhancer region bound by the thiamine-responsive Thi2/Thi3/Pdc2 transcriptional activators. The specificity of histone H3 and/or H4 deacetylation carried out by Hst1 and Sir2 at the distal promoter region depends on the THI gene being tested. Hst1/Sir2-mediated repression of the THI genes occurs at the level of basal expression, thus representing the first set of transcription factors shown to actively repress this gene class. Importantly, lowering the NAD+ concentration and inhibiting the Hst1/Sum1 HDAC complex elevated the intracellular thiamine concentration due to increased thiamine biosynthesis and transport, implicating NAD+ in the control of thiamine homeostasis.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ae0c9f1f2883ab36b604986640203e8d47815cc

Power fact agree wish face.;DemoPaper;A century after the identification of a coenzymatic activity for NAD(+), NAD(+) metabolism has come into the spotlight again due to the potential therapeutic relevance of a set of enzymes whose activity is tightly regulated by the balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of this metabolite. In fact, the actions of NAD(+) have been extended from being an oxidoreductase cofactor for single enzymatic activities to acting as substrate for a wide range of proteins. These include NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and transcription factors that affect a large array of cellular functions. Through these effects, NAD(+) provides a direct link between the cellular redox status and the control of signaling and transcriptional events. Of particular interest within the metabolic/endocrine arena are the recent results, which indicate that the regulation of these NAD(+)-dependent pathways may have a major contribution to oxidative metabolism and life span extension. In this review, we will provide an integrated view on: 1) the pathways that control NAD(+) production and cycling, as well as its cellular compartmentalization; 2) the signaling and transcriptional pathways controlled by NAD(+); and 3) novel data that show how modulation of NAD(+)-producing and -consuming pathways have a major physiological impact and hold promise for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disease.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cd58396ccaf5e3a8a18073ea5fd15480b636b91

Materials and Methods Ten patients, between the ages of 19 and 33 years, in the initial stage of orthodontic treatment, were randomly designated to two groups using the split-mouth design ( n = 10). One group (GICEX) had bands cemented with GIC modified by CLX and a Control group (GIC), evaluated at time intervals before (T0), 3 months (T3), and 6 months (T6) after cementation. Total microbiological counts were performed, and color stability of tooth enamel, salivary pH, and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) were evaluated. Statistical Analysis The Friedman and Dunn’s tests, Mann–Whitney, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey, and paired and non-paired t -tests ( p < 0.05) were used. Results In T3, there was evidence of significant reduction in the quantity of colony forming unit (CFU) in GICEX group in comparison with the Control ( p = 0.041). In T6, the quantity of CFU was similar to the quantity in T3 and significantly different to control ( p = 0.045); Control group demonstrated a similar quantity of CFU between the experimental time intervals ( p = 0.066). Salivary pH demonstrated significant difference only between the time intervals T0 and T6 ( p = 0.022). The tooth enamel color ( p = 0.366) and ARI ( p = 0.343) values demonstrated no significant changes. Conclusion The incorporation of CLX into GIC demonstrated effective antibacterial action, allowed a good bond of the cement to the enamel, a high rate of survival of the bands, did not change the color of the tooth enamel, and maintained the salivary pH at physiological levels.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab5af53194510e502025584fe3cf9a4ba4e50358

Mrs big hit even structure our available.;FullPaper;BACKGROUND, Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (dental braces) to correct the positions of teeth. The success of a fixed appliance depends partly on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being glued to the teeth so that they do not become detached during treatment. Brackets (metal squares) are usually attached to teeth other than molars, where bands (metal rings that go round each tooth) are more commonly used. Orthodontic tubes (stainless steel tubes that allow wires to pass through them), are typically welded to bands but they may also be glued directly (bonded) to molars. Failure of brackets, bands and bonded molar tubes slows down the progress of treatment with a fixed appliance. It can also be costly in terms of clinical time, materials and time lost from education/work for the patient. This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2011. A new full search was conducted on 15 February 2017 but no new studies were identified. We have only updated the search methods section in this new version. The conclusions of this Cochrane review remain the same., , , OBJECTIVES, To evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bonded molar tubes, and the relative effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bonded molar tubes versus adhesives used to attach bands, during fixed appliance treatment, in terms of: (1) how often the tubes (or bands) come off during treatment; and (2) whether they protect the bonded (or banded) teeth against decay., , , SEARCH METHODS, The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 15 February 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 15 February 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 15 February 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 15 February 2017). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, Randomised controlled trials of participants with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) with molar tubes, bonded to first or second permanent molars. Trials which compared any type of adhesive used to bond molar tubes (stainless steel or titanium) with any other adhesive, were included.Trials were also included where:(1) a tube was bonded to a molar tooth on one side of an arch and a band cemented to the same tooth type on the opposite side of the same arch;(2) molar tubes had been allocated to one tooth type in one patient group and molar bands to the same tooth type in another patient group., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, The selection of papers, decision about eligibility and data extraction were carried out independently and in duplicate without blinding to the authors, adhesives used or results obtained. All disagreements were resolved by discussion., , , MAIN RESULTS, Two trials (n = 190), at low risk of bias, were included in the review and both presented data on first time failure at the tooth level. Pooling of the data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands, with a hazard ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.80 to 4.72). No statistically significant heterogeneity was shown between the two studies. Data on first time failure at the patient level were also available and showed statistically different difference in favour of molar bands (risk ratio 2.30; 95% CI 1.56 to 3.41) (risk of event for molar tubes = 57%; risk of event for molar bands 25%).One trial presented data on decalcification again showing a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands. No other adverse events identified., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, From the two well-designed and low risk of bias trials included in this review it was shown that the failure of molar tubes bonded with either a chemically-cured or light-cured adhesive was considerably higher than that of molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement. One trial indicated that there was less decalcification with molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement than with bonded molar tubes cemented with a light-cured adhesive.

Call customer level scientist under consumer.;FullPaper;Gpd1p is a cytosolic NAD+-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase that also localizes to peroxisomes and plays an essential role in the cellular response to osmotic stress and a role in redox balance. Here, we show that Gpd1p is directed to peroxisomes by virtue of an N-terminal type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) in a Pex7p-dependent manner. Significantly, localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is dependent on the metabolic status of cells and the phosphorylation of aminoacyl residues adjacent to the targeting signal. Exposure of cells to osmotic stress induces changes in the subcellular distribution of Gpd1p to the cytosol and nucleus. This behavior is similar to Pnc1p, which is coordinately expressed with Gpd1p, and under conditions of cell stress changes its subcellular distribution from peroxisomes to the nucleus where it mediates chromatin silencing. Although peroxisomes are necessary for the β-oxidation of fatty acids in yeast, the localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is not. Rather, shifts in the distribution of Gpd1p to different cellular compartments in response to changing cellular status suggests a role for Gpd1p in the spatial regulation of redox potential, a process critical to cell survival, especially under the complex stress conditions expected to occur in the wild.;Yes;No;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91f2d2c01023557040784a23e2ffe6cc7cdcd713

The L929 cells were plated (25,000 cells/mL) in wells of 96-well dishes and maintained in a humidified incubator for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO(2), and 95% air. After 24-hour incubation of the cells, the incubation medium was replaced by the immersed medium in which the samples were stored. Then L929 cells were incubated in contact with eluates for 24 hours. The cell mitochondrial activity was evaluated by the methyltetrazolium test. Twelve wells were used for each specimen, and methyltetrazolium tests were applied two times. The data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey Honestly Significantly Different tests., , , RESULTS, Results with L929 fibroblasts demonstrated that all freshly prepared resin-modified orthodontic band adhesive materials reduced vital cell numbers (P > .05), in comparison to the control group.

Calorie restriction (CR) is the most widely researched environmental manipulation that extends lifespan. Activation of the NAD+‐dependent protein deacetylase Sir2 (Silent Information Regulator 2) has been proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of CR in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as other organisms. Here, we show that in contrast to previous reports, Sir2 is not stimulated by CR to strengthen silencing of multiple reporter genes in the rDNA of S. cerevisiae. CR does modestly reduce the frequency of rDNA recombination, although in a SIR2‐independent manner. CR‐mediated repression of rDNA recombination also does not correlate with the silencing of Pol II‐transcribed noncoding RNAs derived from the rDNA intergenic spacer, suggesting that additional silencing‐independent pathways function in lifespan regulation.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30a483f6ad5d1c09215df82672a9083166bcfed9

In addition, we have shown that exogenously supplied nicotinamide riboside is imported into yeast cells by a dedicated transporter, and it extends replicative lifespan on high glucose medium. Here, we show that nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside are authentic intracellular metabolites in yeast. Secreted nicotinamide riboside was detected with a biological assay, and intracellular levels of nicotinamide riboside, nicotinic acid riboside, and other NAD+ metabolites were determined by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. A biochemical genomic screen indicated that three yeast enzymes possess nicotinamide mononucleotide 5′-nucleotidase activity in vitro. Metabolic profiling of knock-out mutants established that Isn1 and Sdt1 are responsible for production of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside in cells. Isn1, initially classified as an IMP-specific 5′-nucleotidase, and Sdt1, initially classified as a pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, are additionally responsible for dephosphorylation of pyridine mononucleotides. Sdt1 overexpression is growth-inhibitory to cells in a manner that depends on its active site and correlates with reduced cellular NAD+. Expression of Isn1 protein is positively regulated by the availability of nicotinic acid and glucose.

Although cements are still used, the popularity of resin and resin-cement hybrid materials is increasing because of their improved physical properties and low solubility in oral fluids. Some cements bond chemically to enamel, but bond strengths are low because cements are brittle and fracture cohesively. Resin adhesives penetrate micropores in etched enamel and mechanical retentions in orthodontic devices, resulting in higher bond strengths because resins are more fracture resistant than cements. Resins, however, do not bond well in the presence of moisture, and their attachment to surfaces is primarily mechanical. Hybridized materials combine the advantages of cements and resins but also have certain disadvantages.

Microorganisms that synthesize NAD from as few as one to as many as five of the six identified biosynthetic precursors have been identified. De novo NAD synthesis from aspartate or tryptophan is neither universal nor strictly aerobic. Salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide riboside, and nicotinic acid riboside occurs via modules of different genes. Nicotinamide salvage genes nadV and pncA, found in distinct bacteria, appear to have spread throughout the tree of life via horizontal gene transfer.

Onto these remain right within voice guess.;DemoPaper;NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is an essential cofactor involved in various biological processes including calorie restriction-mediated life span extension. Administration of nicotinamide riboside (NmR) has been shown to ameliorate deficiencies related to aberrant NAD+ metabolism in both yeast and mammalian cells. However, the biological role of endogenous NmR remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that salvaging endogenous NmR is an integral part of NAD+ metabolism. A balanced NmR salvage cycle is essential for calorie restriction-induced life span extension and stress resistance in yeast. Our results also suggest that partitioning of the pyridine nucleotide flux between the classical salvage cycle and the NmR salvage branch might be modulated by the NAD+-dependent Sir2 deacetylase. Furthermore, two novel deamidation steps leading to nicotinic acid mononucleotide and nicotinic acid riboside production are also uncovered that further underscore the complexity and flexibility of NAD+ metabolism. In addition, utilization of extracellular nicotinamide mononucleotide requires prior conversion to NmR mediated by a periplasmic phosphatase Pho5. Conversion to NmR may thus represent a strategy for the transport and assimilation of large nonpermeable NAD+ precursors. Together, our studies provide a molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors confer metabolic flexibility.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e6425397cecbe1bbba94b784c1cdc57a6221736

Mutations in the protein synthesis machinery or environmental factors that increase synthesis of mistranslated proteins result in cell death and degeneration and are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and with an increasing number of mitochondrial disorders. Remarkably, mRNA mistranslation plays critical roles in the evolution of the genetic code, can be beneficial under stress conditions in yeast and in Escherichia coli and is an important source of peptides for MHC class I complex in dendritic cells. Despite this, its biology has been overlooked over the years due to technical difficulties in its detection and quantification. In order to shed new light on the biological relevance of mistranslation we have generated codon misreading in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using drugs and tRNA engineering methodologies. Surprisingly, such mistranslation up-regulated the longevity gene PNC1. Similar results were also obtained in cells grown in the presence of amino acid analogues that promote protein misfolding. The overall data showed that PNC1 is a biomarker of mRNA mistranslation and protein misfolding and that PNC1-GFP fusions can be used to monitor these two important biological phenomena in vivo in an easy manner, thus opening new avenues to understand their biological relevance.;No;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f3edebaf36b4fa3252db72590c0a872c112d2f4

Someone recognize building your none simply.;DemoPaper;The histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p is dependent on NAD+ and inhibited by nicotinamide (NAM). As a result, Sir2p-regulated processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae such as silencing and replicative aging are susceptible to alterations in cellular NAD+ and NAM levels. We have determined that high concentrations of NAM in the growth medium elevate the intracellular NAD+ concentration through a mechanism that is partially dependent on NPT1, an important gene in the Preiss–Handler NAD+ salvage pathway. Overexpression of the nicotinamidase, Pnc1p, prevents inhibition of Sir2p by the excess NAM while maintaining the elevated NAD+ concentration. This growth condition alters the epigenetics of rDNA silencing, such that repression of a URA3 reporter gene located at the rDNA induces growth on media that either lacks uracil or contains 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), an unusual dual phenotype that is reminiscent of telomeric silencing (TPE) of URA3. Despite the similarities to TPE, the modified rDNA silencing phenotype does not require the SIR complex. Instead, it retains key characteristics of typical rDNA silencing, including RENT and Pol I dependence, as well as a requirement for the Preiss–Handler NAD+ salvage pathway. Exogenous nicotinamide can therefore have negative or positive impacts on rDNA silencing, depending on the PNC1 expression level.;Yes;Yes;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f634e0ccd37bfebcec293c8dbd03b7b4afa3a87

Nicotinamide riboside is a recently discovered eukaryotic NAD+ precursor converted to NAD+ via the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway and by nucleosidase activity and nicotinamide salvage. Nicotinamide riboside supplementation of yeast extends replicative life span on high glucose medium. The molecular basis for nicotinamide riboside uptake was unknown in any eukaryote. Here, we show that deletion of a single gene, YOR071C, abrogates nicotinamide riboside uptake without altering nicotinic acid or nicotinamide import. The gene, which is negatively regulated by Sum1, Hst1, and Rfm1, fully restores nicotinamide riboside import and utilization when resupplied to mutant yeast cells. The encoded polypeptide, Nrt1, is a predicted deca-spanning membrane protein related to the thiamine transporter, which functions as a pH-dependent facilitator with a Km for nicotinamide riboside of 22 μm.

The activity of the purified enzyme was determined by HPLC, and it was shown that it possessed similar pyrazinamidase and nicotinamidase activity, by contrast with previous reports. Nine PncA mutants were generated by site‐directed mutagenesis. Determination of the enzymatic activity and metal ion content suggested that Asp8, Lys96 and Cys138 were key residues for catalysis, and Asp49, His51, His57 and His71 were essential for metal ion binding.

Salvage of NR in C. glabrata occurs via two routes. The first, in which NR is phosphorylated by the NR kinase Nrk1, is independent of the Preiss–Handler pathway.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CR has been proposed to extend lifespan by boosting the activity of sirtuin deacetylases, thereby suppressing the formation of toxic repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) circles. An alternative theory is that CR works by suppressing the TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, which extends lifespan via mechanisms that are unknown but thought to be independent of sirtuins. Here we show that TOR inhibition extends lifespan by the same mechanism as CR: by increasing Sir2p activity and stabilizing the rDNA locus. Further, we show that rDNA stabilization and lifespan extension by both CR and TOR signaling is due to the relocalization of the transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they increase expression of the nicotinamidase gene PNC1.

Possible everything step nearly.;DemoPaper;It has been suggested that nicotinamide must be degraded during germination; however, the enzyme responsible and its physiological role have not been previously studied. We have identified an Arabidopsis gene, NIC2, that is expressed at relatively high levels in mature seed, and encodes a nicotinamidase enzyme with homology to yeast and bacterial nicotinamidases. Seed of a knockout mutant, nic2-1, had reduced nicotinamidase activity, retarded germination and impaired germination potential. nic2-1 germination was restored by after-ripening or moist chilling, but remained hypersensitive to application of nicotinamide or ABA. Nicotinamide is a known inhibitor of NAD-degrading poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP enzymes) that are implicated in DNA repair. We found reduced poly(ADP)ribosylation levels in nic2-1 seed, which were restored by moist chilling. Furthermore, nic2-1 seed had elevated levels of NAD, and germination was hypersensitive to methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), suggesting that PARP activity and DNA repair responses were impaired. We suggest that nicotinamide is normally metabolized by NIC2 during moist chilling or after-ripening, which relieves inhibition of PARP activity and allows DNA repair to occur prior to germination.;Yes;No;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/661be36bca2e99b45a295b9b7916c5f94d3fac33

Enzymes involved in NAD+ metabolism are attractive targets for drug discovery against a variety of human diseases, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, neurodegeneration and Huntington’s disease. A small-molecule inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, an enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis, is presently in clinical trials against cancer. An analog of a kynurenine pathway intermediate is efficacious against multiple sclerosis in an animal model. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase plays an important role in immune evasion by cancer cells and other disease processes. Inhibitors against kynurenine 3-hydroxylase can reduce the production of neurotoxic metabolites while increasing the production of neuroprotective compounds.

Decide there issue fight front. Apply positive toward rise act themselves.;DemoPaper;Purpose of reviewNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a classic coenzyme in cellular redox reactions. Recently, NAD biochemistry has also been implicated in a broader range of biological functions in mammals, but the regulation of NAD biosynthesis has been poorly investigated. Recent progress in the field of NAD biochemistry has fueled new interest in the NAD biosynthetic pathways from its precursors and their physiological roles in metabolism. This review summarizes the latest knowledge on the NAD biosynthetic pathways and focuses on one of the key NAD biosynthetic enzymes, namely, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Recent findingsMammals predominantly use nicotinamide rather than nicotinic acid as a precursor for NAD biosynthesis. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is the rate-limiting enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide in the NAD biosynthetic pathway from nicotinamide in mammals. The same protein has also been identified as a cytokine (pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor or PBEF) or an insulin-mimetic hormone (visfatin). SummaryWe propose that the presumed multiple effects of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin may be entirely explained by its role as an intra and extracellular NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We also propose a new model of Namp/PBEF/visfatin-mediated systemic NAD biosynthesis and its possible physiological significance. Our model provides an important insight into developing preventive/therapeutic interventions for metabolic complications, such as obesity and diabetes.;No;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78a9094511c420715bc4d5edfd073863ad0511ed

Dream serious minute throw husband important. Less always million realize wide end.;Poster;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which is derived from NAD, have important roles as a redox carriers in metabolism. A combination of de novo and salvage pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of NAD in all organisms. The pathways and enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway in yeast and animals, which diverge at nicotinamide, have been extensively studied. Yeast cells convert nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, while mammals lack the enzyme nicotinamidase and instead convert nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana gene At2g22570 encodes a nicotinamidase, which is expressed in all tissues, with the highest levels observed in roots and stems. The 244-residue protein, designated AtNIC1, converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid and has a Km value of 118 +/- 17 microM and a Kcat value of 0.93 +/- 0.13 sec(-1). Plants homozygous for a null AtNIC1 allele, nic1-1, have lower levels of NAD and NADP under normal growth conditions, indicating that AtNIC1 participates in a yeast-type NAD salvage pathway. Mutant plants also exhibit hypersensitivity to treatments of abscisic acid and NaCl, which is correlated with their inability to increase the cellular levels of NAD(H) under these growth conditions, as occurs in wild-type plants. We also show that the growth of the roots of wild-type but not nic1-1 mutant plants is inhibited and distorted by nicotinamide.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f73893c5681b0eb0dd5ef81cb5b8e18832758218

Recently lead American own budget.;DemoPaper;The plasma membrane ATP‐binding cassette (ABC) transporter, Pdr5p, mediates resistance to many different xenobiotic compounds in yeast. We have isolated several mutated forms that fail to confer resistance to cycloheximide and itraconazole. Here, we examined two variants, the expression of which was abnormally low when cells reach the stationary phase of growth. The Pdr51157 variant lacked the C‐terminal transmembrane domain due to the presence of a nonsense mutation at codon 1158. The second variant, Pdr5L183P, contained a Leu183Pro substitution close to the Walker A motif in the N‐terminal nucleotide‐binding domain. This substitution impaired UTPase activity as well as protein stability. The Pdr5L183P variant induced the unfolded protein response and was targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the highly unstable Pdr5L183P was mislocalized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐associated compartments, whereas the truncated Pdr51157 protein was retained in the ER. When threonine 363 (located in the first nucleotide‐binding domain, close to the Walker B motif) in Pdr5L183P was replaced with isoleucine, this double mutant conferred partial drug resistance. These results suggest that Pdr5p requires a properly folded nucleotide‐binding domain for trafficking to the plasma membrane.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fadf6278ec794e3a3dc0ad7625ba2cb434e6799c

We constructed a diploid strain heterozygous for disruption of POS5, encoding mitochondrial NADH kinase, UTR1, cytosolic NAD kinase, and YEF1, a UTR1-homologous gene we characterized as encoding a low specific activity cytosolic NAD kinase. pos5 utr1 is a synthetic lethal combination rescued by plasmid-borne copies of the POS5 or UTR1 genes or by YEF1 driven by the ADH1 promoter. Respiratory-deficient and oxidative damage-sensitive defects in pos5 mutants were not made more deleterious by yef1 deletion, and a quantitative growth phenotype of pos5 and its arginine auxotrophy were repaired by plasmid-borne POS5 but not UTR1 or ADH1-driven YEF1. utr1 haploids have a slow growth phenotype on glucose not exacerbated by yef1 deletion but reversed by either plasmid-borne UTR1 or ADH1-driven YEF1. The defect in fermentative growth of utr1 mutants renders POS5 but not POS5-dependent mitochondrial genome maintenance essential because rho–utr1 derivatives are viable. Purified Yef1 has similar nucleoside triphosphate specificity but substantially lower specific activity and less discrimination in favor of NAD versus NADH phosphorylation than Utr1. Low expression and low intrinsic NAD kinase activity of Yef1 and the lack of phenotype associated with yef1 suggest that Utr1 and Pos5 are responsible for essentially all NAD/NADH kinase activity in vivo. The data are compatible with a model in which there is no exchange of NADP, NADPH, or cytoplasmic NAD/NADH kinase between nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments, but the cytoplasm is exposed to mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase during the transit of the molecule.;Yes;Yes;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9b16957f920efd6df29f0c25451a70f130761b9

Strain Kh5 was grown in yeast nitrogen base (YNB) plus glucose (G medium) or YNB plus cell walls of B. cinerea (B medium). Thirty-five primer pairs were used in AFLP amplifications, resulting in a total of more than 2,450 bands derived from the mRNA of strain Kh5 grown in B medium. Eighty-six bands (3.5%) corresponded to genes upregulated in B medium compared with G medium. Of these 86 bands, 28 were selected, cloned, sequenced, and subjected to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm their differential expression. An appropriate housekeeping gene, G2, was selected and used to normalize the results of RT-PCR. Eleven genes presented an increased gene expression in the presence of B. cinerea cell walls (expression >1). Statistical analysis showed a significant increase for 5 of these 11 genes. The overexpressed genes show homologies to yeast genes with various functions, including beta-glucosidase, transmembrane transport, citrate synthase, and external amino acid sensing and transport. Some of these functions could be related to cell wall metabolism and potentially involved in mycoparasitic properties.;Yes;No;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bbbc5aeb069290655668c1049145ef952e36fc7

Billion nature between itself page inside.;FullPaper;Recent studies have revealed new roles for NAD and its derivatives in transcriptional regulation. The evolutionarily conserved Sir2 protein family requires NAD for its deacetylase activity and regulates a variety of biological processes, such as stress response, differentiation, metabolism, and aging. Despite its absolute requirement for NAD, the regulation of Sir2 function by NAD biosynthesis pathways is poorly understood in mammals. In this study, we determined the kinetics of the NAD biosynthesis mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), and we examined its effects on the transcriptional regulatory function of the mouse Sir2 ortholog, Sir2α, in mouse fibroblasts. We found that Nampt was the ratelimiting component in this mammalian NAD biosynthesis pathway. Increased dosage of Nampt, but not Nmnat, increased the total cellular NAD level and enhanced the transcriptional regulatory activity of the catalytic domain of Sir2α recruited onto a reporter gene in mouse fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays also demonstrated a significant correlation between the expression profiles of Nampt- and Sir2α-overexpressing cells. These findings suggest that NAD biosynthesis mediated by Nampt regulates the function of Sir2α and thereby plays an important role in controlling various biological events in mammals.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29d94106c60ae0b286dfa55bf23fc5710d755c4b

In yeast, quiescence is induced by carbon starvation, and exit occurs when a carbon source becomes available. To understand how cells survive in, and exit from this state, mRNA abundance was examined using oligonucleotide-based microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cells in stationary-phase cultures exhibited a coordinated response within 5-10 min of refeeding. Levels of >1800 mRNAs increased dramatically (>or=64-fold), and a smaller group of stationary-phase mRNAs decreased in abundance. Motif analysis of sequences upstream of genes clustered by VxInsight identified an overrepresentation of Rap1p and BUF (RPA) binding sites in genes whose mRNA levels rapidly increased during exit. Examination of 95 strains carrying deletions in stationary-phase genes induced identified 32 genes essential for survival in stationary-phase at 37 degrees C. Analysis of these genes suggests that mitochondrial function is critical for entry into stationary-phase and that posttranslational modifications and protection from oxidative stress become important later. The phylogenetic conservation of stationary-phase genes, and our findings that two-thirds of the essential stationary-phase genes have human homologues and of these, many have human homologues that are disease related, demonstrate that yeast is a bona fide model system for studying the quiescent state of eukaryotic cells.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3720e11d6c3f89345d13bc1e9aef14b84042c05

Recent years have seen an increase in the number of signalling and gene regulatory processes where NAD+ or NADP+ are metabolised. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) are metabolites of NAD+ and NADP+ , respectively, and now have widely accepted roles as potent intracellular calcium releasing agents in animals, but are less well characterised in plants. NAD kinases catalyse the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to form NADP and are well characterised in plants in their requirement for the calcium binding protein calmodulin, thereby putatively linking their regulation to stress-induced intracellular calcium release. A second group of proteins unrelated to those above, the sirtuins (Sir2) and poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), cleave NAD and transfer the ADP-ribose group to acetyl groups and proteins, respectively.

The Sirtuins are phylogenetically conserved in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and Archeal species. Prokaryotic and Archeal species usually have one or two Sirtuin homologs, whereas eukaryotes typically have multiple versions. The founding member of this protein family is the Sir2 histone deacetylase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is absolutely required for transcriptional silencing in this organism. Sirtuins in other organisms often have nonhistone substrates and in eukaryotes, are not always localized in the nucleus. The diversity of substrates is reflected in the various biological activities that Sirtuins function, including development, metabolism, apoptosis, and heterochromatin formation. This review emphasizes the great diversity in Sirtuin function and highlights its unusual catalytic properties.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6043d5c89ca00fe7eb3241e9416a4c8ccb4b732

The NAD+ salvage pathway protein, Npt1, regulates Sir2-mediated processes by maintaining a sufficiently high intracellular NAD+ concentration. However, another NAD+ salvage pathway component, Pnc1, modulates silencing independently of the NAD+ concentration. Nicotinamide (NAM) is a by-product of the Sir2 deacetylase reaction and is a natural Sir2 inhibitor. Pnc1 is a nicotinamidase that converts NAM to nicotinic acid. Here we show that recombinant Pnc1 stimulates Sir2 HDAC activity in vitro by preventing the accumulation of NAM produced by Sir2. In vivo, telomeric, rDNA, and HM silencing are differentially sensitive to inhibition by NAM. Furthermore, PNC1 overexpression suppresses the inhibitory effect of exogenously added NAM on silencing, life span, and Hst1-mediated transcriptional repression. Finally, we show that stress suppresses the inhibitory effect of NAM through the induction of PNC1 expression. Pnc1, therefore, positively regulates Sir2-mediated silencing and longevity by preventing the accumulation of intracellular NAM during times of stress.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1aa94ba349075b192f11bc9a50bd49548f67eeef

Previously, we showed that calorie restriction increases the replicative life span in yeast by activating Sir2, a highly conserved NAD-dependent deacetylase. Here we test whether CR activates Sir2 by increasing the NAD/NADH ratio or by regulating the level of nicotinamide, a known inhibitor of Sir2. We show that CR decreases NADH levels, and that NADH is a competitive inhibitor of Sir2. A genetic intervention that specifically decreases NADH levels increases life span, validating the model that NADH regulates yeast longevity in response to CR.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87af52902bef6f7a1cf59f72f00a9850afe2d8d8

My protect sea.;Poster;SUMMARY When it was first proposed that the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae might serve as a model for human aging in 1959, the suggestion was met with considerable skepticism. Although yeast had proved a valuable model for understanding basic cellular processes in humans, it was difficult to accept that such a simple unicellular organism could provide information about human aging, one of the most complex of biological phenomena. While it is true that causes of aging are likely to be multifarious, there is a growing realization that all eukaryotes possess surprisingly conserved longevity pathways that govern the pace of aging. This realization has come, in part, from studies of S. cerevisiae, which has emerged as a highly informative and respected model for the study of life span regulation. Genomic instability has been identified as a major cause of aging, and over a dozen longevity genes have now been identified that suppress it. Here we present the key discoveries in the yeast-aging field, regarding both the replicative and chronological measures of life span in this organism. We discuss the implications of these findings not only for mammalian longevity but also for other key aspects of cell biology, including cell survival, the relationship between chromatin structure and genome stability, and the effect of internal and external environments on cellular defense pathways. We focus on the regulation of replicative life span, since recent findings have shed considerable light on the mechanisms controlling this process. We also present the specific methods used to study aging and longevity regulation in S. cerevisiae.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50add9ed68ab0e46b7cc13a40acd8667ea376821

Race special speak though particularly happen discover.;FullPaper;NAD+, an essential molecule involved in a variety of cellular processes, is synthesized through de novo and salvage pathways. NAD+ synthetase catalyses the final step in both pathways. Here we show that this enzyme is encoded by the QNS1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis NAD+ synthetases was able to suppress the lethality of a qns1 deletion, while a B. subtilis NAD+ synthetase mutant with lowered catalytic activity was not. Overexpression of QNS1 tagged with HA led to elevated levels of NAD+ synthetase activity in yeast extracts, and this activity can be recovered by immunoprecipitation using anti‐HA antibody. An allele of QNS1 was constructed that carries a point mutation predicted to reduce the catalytic activity. Overexpression of this allele, qns1G521E, failed to elevate NAD+ synthetase levels and qns1G521E could not rescue the lethality caused by the depletion of Qns1p. These results demonstrate that NAD+ synthetase activity is essential for cell viability. A GFP‐tagged version of Qns1p displayed a diffuse localization in both the nucleus and the cytosol. Finally, the rat homologue of QNS1 was cloned and shown to functionally replace yeast QNS1, indicating that NAD+ synthetase is functionally conserved from bacteria to yeast and mammals.

The involvement of NAD in these regulatory processes is based on its ability to function as a donor of ADP-ribose; NAD synthesis is therefore required to avoid depletion of the intracellular pool. The rising interest in the biosynthetic routes leading to NAD formation and the highly conserved nature of the enzymes involved prompted us to reconstruct the NAD biosynthetic routes operating in distinct eukaryotic organisms. The evidence obtained from biochemical and computational analysis provides a good example of how complex metabolic pathways may evolve. In particular, it is proposed that the development of several NAD biosynthetic routes during evolution has led to partial functional redundancy, allowing a given pathway to freely acquire novel functions unrelated to NAD biosynthesis.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7b2826d5a73b7522a94b3bac42ffc08ccd4c2bb

Film beautiful common speech grow officer three decade. Country fall though memory.;FullPaper;The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 protein is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing, genome stability, and longevity. A human homologue of Sir2, SIRT1, regulates the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits apoptosis. The Sir2 deacetylation reaction generates two products:O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, a precursor of nicotinic acid and a form of niacin/vitamin B3. We show here that nicotinamide strongly inhibits yeast silencing, increases rDNA recombination, and shortens replicative life span to that of asir2 mutant. Nicotinamide abolishes silencing and leads to an eventual delocalization of Sir2 even in G1-arrested cells, demonstrating that silent heterochromatin requires continual Sir2 activity. We show that physiological concentrations of nicotinamide noncompetitively inhibit both Sir2 and SIRT1 in vitro. The degree of inhibition by nicotinamide (IC50< 50 μm) is equal to or better than the most effective known synthetic inhibitors of this class of proteins. We propose a model whereby nicotinamide inhibits deacetylation by binding to a conserved pocket adjacent to NAD+, thereby blocking NAD+ hydrolysis. We discuss the possibility that nicotinamide is a physiologically relevant regulator of Sir2 enzymes.;Yes;Yes;2002;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a900c08686eb55b9dc077ddfc3e311e68e11d5ec

Here we show that increased dosage of NPT1, encoding a nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase critical for the NAD+ salvage pathway, increases Sir2-dependent silencing, stabilizes the rDNA locus, and extends yeast replicative life span by up to 60%. Both NPT1 and SIR2provide resistance against heat shock, demonstrating that these genes act in a more general manner to promote cell survival. We show that Npt1 and a previously uncharacterized salvage pathway enzyme, Nma2, are both concentrated in the nucleus, indicating that a significant amount of NAD+ is regenerated in this organelle. Additional copies of the salvage pathway genes, PNC1, NMA1, andNMA2, increase telomeric and rDNA silencing, implying that multiple steps affect the rate of the pathway. AlthoughSIR2-dependent processes are enhanced by additional NPT1, steady-state NAD+ levels and NAD+/NADH ratios remain unaltered. This finding suggests that yeast life span extension may be facilitated by an increase in the availability of NAD+ to Sir2, although not through a simple increase in steady-state levels. We propose a model in which increased flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway is responsible for the Sir2-dependent extension of life span.;Yes;Yes;2002;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8589755fd3d57f5ee7e4aaa434f7a2c64d017991

Utilization remains variable between centers using ECMO as a rescue therapy or early protocolized extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: Single-center, retrospective evaluation of cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and rescue ECMO support from 2011 through 2019. Study objectives included survival, non-neurologic, and neurologic outcomes; validation of the SAVE and modified SAVE (mSAVE) scores for survival and favorable neurologic outcome; and predictive factor identification in cardiac arrest with ECMO rescue therapy. Results: Eighty-nine patients were included. In-hospital survival was 38.2% and median CPC score was 2. Survivors had lower BMI (27.9 ± 4.2 kg/m2 vs. 32.3 ± 7.5 kg/m2, P = 0.003), less obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) (26.5% vs. 49.1%, P = 0.035), shorter CPR duration (35.5 ± 31.7 m vs. 58.0 ± 49.5 m, P = 0.019), more tracheostomy (38.2% vs. 7.3%, P < 0.001), and less renal replacement therapy (RRT) (17.6% vs. 38.2%, P = 0.031). Patients with a favorable neurologic outcome had lower body weight (86.2 ± 17.9 kg vs. 98.1 ± 19.4 kg, P = 0.010), lower BMI (28.1 ± 4.5 kg/m2 vs. 33.9 ± 7.9 kg/m2, P < 0.001), and less obesity (29.7% vs. 56.3%, P = 0.026). mSAVE score predicted in-hospital survival (OR 1.11; 95%CI 1.03–1.19; P = 0.004) and favorable neurologic outcome (OR 1.11; 1.03–1.20; P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis for in-hospital survival included mSAVE, BMI, CPR-time, tracheostomy, and RRT (c-statistic: 0.864). Favorable neurologic outcome included mSAVE and BMI (c-statistic: 0.805). Conclusions: mSAVE, BMI, RRT, and tracheostomy are predictors of in-hospital survival and mSAVE and BMI are predictors of favorable neurologic outcome in cardiac arrest with ECMO rescue therapy.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45546409c23e1b5a3c1ae99af9c97d345fbc34ca

Our objective was to provide an update on (1) challenges of obesity definition and classification in the perioperative setting, (2) challenges of perioperative patient positioning and vascular access, (3) perioperative implications of childhood obesity, (3) anesthetic medication dosing and opioid-sparing techniques in obese children, and (4) research gaps in perioperative childhood obesity research including a call to action. Recent findings Despite the near axiomatic observation that obesity is a pervasive clinical problem with considerable impact on perioperative health, there have only been a handful of research into the many ramifications of childhood obesity in the perioperative setting. A nuanced understanding of the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with obesity is essential to inform patients’ perioperative consultation and their parents’ counseling, improve preoperative risk mitigation, and improve patients’ rescue process when complications occur.

Design: Hierarchical mixed effects analyses were used to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with AC or CVC placement. The ICU adjusted median odds ratios (ICU-AMOR) for the admission ICU, marginal R2, and conditional intraclass correlation coefficient were reported. Setting: 166 PICUs in the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS, LLC) Database. Patients: 682,791 patients with unscheduled admissions to the PICU. Intervention: None. Measures and Main Results: ACs were placed in (median, [interquartile range]) 8.2% [4.9%-11.3%] of admissions, and CVCs were placed in 14.9% [10.4%-19.3%] of admissions across cohort ICUs. Measured patient characteristics explained about 25% of the variability in AC and CVC placement. Higher Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) illness severity scores were associated with increased odds of placement (Odds Ratio (95th% Confidence Interval)) AC: 1.88 (1.87-1.89) and CVC: 1.82 (1.81-1.83) per 1 unit increase in PIM2 score. Primary diagnoses of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematology/oncology, infectious, renal/genitourinary, rheumatology, and transplant were associated with increased odds of AC or CVC placement compared to a primary respiratory diagnosis. Presence of in-house attendings 24/7 was associated with increased odds of AC placement 1.32 (1.11-1.57). Admission ICU explained 4.9% and 3.5% of the variability in AC or CVC placement, respectively. The ICU-AMOR showed a patient would have a median increase in odds of 55% and 43% for AC or CVC placement, respectively, if the same patient moved from an ICU with lower odds of placement to an ICU with higher odds of placement. Conclusions: Variation in AC or CVC use exists among PICUs. The admission ICU was more strongly associated with AC than with CVC placement.

Furthermore, many hospitalized patients do not meet the criteria for central venous catheter positioning, unless an upgrade of the treatment is further needed. The mini-midline catheter has already showed to be reliable and safe as a stand-alone device, since it is easily and rapidly inserted and can indwell up to 1 month. Methods: In this further case series, we retrospectively evaluated data from 63 patients where a previously inserted mini-midline catheter was upgraded to a central venous catheter (the devices inserted in the arm replaced by peripherally inserted central catheter and others inserted “off-label” in the internal jugular replaced by single lumen centrally inserted central catheter), being used as introducer for the Seldinger guidewire. Results: The guidewire replacement was been made even early (after 1 day) or late (more than 10 days), usually following a need for an upgrade in treatment.

In this section, we discuss the assessment and management of pain and discomfort during interventions, review the doses and side effects of commonly used medications, and provide recommendations for their use in newborns with heart disease. For procedures requiring deeper levels of sedation and anesthesia, airway and hemodynamic support might be necessary. Although associations of long-term deleterious neurocognitive effects of anesthetic agents have received considerable attention in both scientific and lay press, causality is not established.

The internal jugular vein is the preferred site for cannulation. Though, there are several studies describing the relation of the common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV) in the neck, there is a paucity of data regarding the anatomical relationship between the vertebral artery (VA) and the IJV. This study aims to describe the anatomical relationship between the IJV and the VA using ultrasound imaging in pre-school children in India. Material and Methods: Prospective observational cross-sectional study of 67 randomly selected children (age <5 years) who underwent an ultrasound examination of the right side of the neck, in a position mimicking central venous cannulation, to identify the relationship between the IJV and VA. The skin to the vertebral artery depth (D), width of the VA (W), distance between the IJV and the VA (DIV) was measured. Based on these, children were classified into high risk, moderate risk and low risk category for VA puncture.

Meeting politics age case news morning.;ShortPaper;The insertion of long-term central venous catheters is a standard of care for children affected by malignancies, although it can be associated with life-threatening complications. The present paper reports an unusual mechanical complication related to the use of a long term tunneled central venous catheter in a pediatric oncologic patient. An 18 months old child, diagnosed with stage M high-risk retroperitoneal neuroblastoma, underwent ultrasound-guided placement of a 6 Fr bilumen long-term tunneled central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein prior to the beginning of induction chemotherapy. The correct position of the distal tip of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopy. After 4 months of regular use of the device, the patient experienced neck swelling during high-dose chemotherapy infusion. A chest x-ray showed a dislocated catheter and bilateral pleural effusion. CT scan demonstrated the tip of the catheter rupturing the medial wall of the right jugular vein and entering the mediastinum; furthermore, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous neck emphysema and bilateral pleural effusion were noticed and a thrombus was evident in the right jugular vein at the insertion in the brachiocephalic vein. The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and bilateral thoracostomy tubes were placed urgently (500 mL of clear fluid were evacuated from pleural spaces). The dislocated catheter was removed electively on the following day under fluoroscopy. Despite ultrasound-guided placement and long-term uneventful use of the catheter, life-threatening central venous catheter-related mechanical complications can occur; the current case report emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of patients with central venous catheters in order to quickly diagnose and treat potentially lethal complications.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/798f1dafd5e47c606102d3bb4157e102495a9fb2

Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, pyridoxal phosphate, acetic anhydride, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide under specified conditions inactivated both acetylcholinesterase and aryl acylamidase in the absence of acetylcholine and BW284C51. Chemical modifications in the presence of acetylcholine and BW284C51 by all the above except diethyl pyrocarbonate selectively prevented the loss of acetylcholinesterase but not aryl acylamidase activity; modification by diethyl pyrocarbonate in the presence of acetylcholine and BW284C51 prevented the loss of both acetylcholinesterase and aryl acylamidase activities. Treatment with N-acetylimidazole resulted in the inactivation of acetylcholinesterase and the activation of aryl acylamidase. These changes in both the activities could be prevented by acetylcholine and BW284C51. Modification by phenylglyoxal, 2,4-pentanedione, or N-ethylmaleimide did not affect the enzyme activities. Indophenylacetate hydrolase activity followed a pattern similar to that of acetylcholinesterase in all the above modification studies. The results suggested essential lysine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine residues for the active center of acetylcholinesterase and essential lysine, histidine, and tryptophan residues for the active center of aryl acylamidase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);Yes;Yes;1984;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2bb8e916f8d943782c4356077c94ad1fcd3a71b0

The interpretation of experiments has been limited by difficulty in identifying individual rate constants. In order to invert the kinetic data, and to gain information about the individual reacting sites, we introduce a Laplace inversion technique and obtain the distribution function of rate constants by which the intricate reaction proceeds. A series of carefully overlapped experiments were performed on lysozyme at 25°C, an exchange profile obtained, and a distribution function extracted. This function was composed of a product of two terms, indicating two parallel pathways. The first, a power‐law term, was attributed to exchange from the native state. This part of the distribution function thus describes the scope of the conformational fluctuations in proteins at constant temperature and pressure. The second, an exponential, was seen to be associated with the pathway involving thermal unfolding and subsequent free exchange with the solvent. The influence of trichlorethanol and glycerol on the total distribution function was measured. Trichloroethanol selectively increased the contribution from the thermal unfolding pathway, whereas glycerol, besides decreasing this type of contribution, increased the width of the distribution function attributed to structural fluctuations.;Yes;Yes;1980;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006400fc1d0daeb7ea8ef7b1d3fc7a9b907a8d01

So artist daughter professor care hundred personal.;Poster;Many aromatic amines and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are known carcinogens for animals, and there is also strong evidence of some in human cancer. The activation of these compounds, including some arylamine drugs, involves N-hydroxylation, usually by cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450) in Family 1 (1A2, 1A1, and 1B1). We previously demonstrated that the bioactivation product of the anticancer agent 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F 203), an N-hydroxylamine, can be reduced by P450 2S1 to its amine precursor under anaerobic conditions and, to a lesser extent, under aerobic conditions [Wang, K., and Guengerich, F. P. (2012) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 25, 1740-1751]. In the study presented here, we tested the hypothesis that P450 2S1 is involved in the reductive biotransformation of known carcinogenic aromatic amines and HAAs. The N-hydroxylamines of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) were synthesized and found to be reduced by P450 2S1 under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The formation of amines due to P450 2S1 reduction also occurred under aerobic conditions but was less apparent because the competitive disproportionation reactions (of the N-hydroxylamines) also yielded amines. Further, some nitroso and nitro derivatives of the arylamines could also be reduced by P450 2S1. None of the amines tested were oxidized by P450 2S1. These results suggest that P450 2S1 may be involved in the reductive detoxication of several of the activated products of carcinogenic aromatic amines and HAAs.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/065471b8132ea20d4f7e90ee546c44f785c2c1cb

Sit house surface idea change purpose.;DemoPaper;Background: High amidoxime reductase activity is found in liver and fat tissue, although its composition in cells is unknown. Results: Amidoxime reductase is up-regulated during adipogenesis and requires MOSC2 and CYB5B. Conclusion: MOSC2 and CYB5B are essential components of the mitochondrial amidoxime reductase, and MOSC2 is important for lipogenesis. Significance: We suggest a role of MOSC2 in adipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and as a potential novel drug target. Reduction of hydroxylamines and amidoximes is important for drug activation and detoxification of aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Such a reductase system was previously found to be of high activity in adipose tissue and liver, and furthermore, in vitro studies using recombinant truncated and purified enzymes suggested the participation of cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R), cytochrome b5 (CYB5), and molybdenum cofactor sulfurase C-terminal containing 1 and 2 (MOSC1 and -2). Here, we show that purified rat liver outer mitochondrial membrane contains high amidoxime reductase activity and that MOSC2 is exclusively localized to these membranes. Moreover, using the same membrane fraction, we could show direct binding of a radiolabeled benzamidoxime substrate to MOSC2. Following differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 cells into mature adipocytes, the MOSC2 levels as well as the amidoxime reductase activity were increased, indicating that the enzyme is highly regulated under lipogenic conditions. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of MOSC2 and the mitochondrial form of cytochrome b5 type B (CYB5B) significantly inhibited the reductase activity in the differentiated adipocytes, whereas down-regulation of MOSC1, cytochrome b5 type A (CYB5A), CYB5R1, CYB5R2, or CYB5R3 had no effect. Down-regulation of MOSC2 caused impaired lipid synthesis. These results demonstrate for the first time the direct involvement of MOSC2 and CYB5B in the amidoxime reductase activity in an intact cell system. We postulate the presence of a novel reductive enzyme system of importance for lipid synthesis that is exclusively localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and is composed of CYB5B, MOSC2, and a third unknown component (a CYB5B reductase).;Yes;No;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e3c30af540e801fb19d536cb041eaf21e1a134b

Upon reconstitution with the electron transport proteins, cytochrome b5 and its reductase, this molybdenum enzyme is capable of reducing N-hydroxylated compounds. It was named mARC because the N-reduction of amidoxime structures was initially studied using this isolated mitochondrial enzyme. All hitherto analyzed mammalian genomes harbor two mARC genes: molybdenum cofactor (Moco) sulferase C-terminal domain MOSC1 and MOSC2. Proteins encoded by these genes represent the simplest eukaryotic molybdenum enzymes, in that they bind only the Moco. It is also suggested that they are members of a new family of molybdenum enzymes. mARC and its N-reductive enzyme system plays a major role in drug metabolism, especially in the activation of so-called “amidoxime-prodrugs” and in the detoxification of N-hydroxylated xenobiotics, though its physiological relevance is largely unknown.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/936fc3c240a18f55a4822e0e6c30a1fd6a1da283

One responsible enzyme system, the microsomal benzamidoxime reductase, consisting of cytochrome b5, its reductase, and a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme, was isolated from pig liver microsomes (J Biol Chem 272:19615–19620). Further investigations followed to establish whether such enzyme systems are also present in microsomes of other organs such as brain, lung, and intestine. In addition, the mitochondrial reduction in human and porcine liver and kidney preparations was studied. The reductase activities were measured by following the reduction of benzamidoxime to benzamidine, guanoxabenz to guanabenz, and Ro 48-3656 ([[1-[(2S)-2-[[4-[(hydroxyamino)iminomethyl]benzoyl]amino]-1-oxopropyl]-4-piperidinyl]oxy]-acetic acid) to Ro 44-3888 ([[1-[(2S)-2-[[4-(aminoiminomethyl)benzoyl]amino]-1-oxopropyl]-4-piperidinyl]oxy]-acetic acid). Interestingly, preparations of all tested organs were capable of reducing the three compounds. The highest specific rates were found in kidney followed by liver, brain, lung, and intestine, and usually the mitochondrial reduction rates were superior. From the determined characteristics, similarities between the enzyme systems in the different organs and organelles were detected. Furthermore, properties of the benzamidoxime reductase located in the outer membrane of pig liver mitochondria were studied. In summary, these results demonstrate that in addition to the microsomal reduction, mitochondria are involved to a great extent in the activation of amidoxime prodrugs.

The hydroxylated amidines can be used as prodrug moieties, and an understanding of the enzyme system active in the reduction can contribute to more efficient drug development. In this study, we examined the properties of this enzyme system using benzamidoxime and N-hydroxymelagatran as substrates. In rats and humans, the hepatic enzyme system was localized in mitochondria as well as in microsomes, using preferably NADH as cofactor. Potassium cyanide, N-methylhydroxylamine, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and desferrioxamine were efficient inhibitors, whereas typical cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibitors were ineffective. In rats, the highest specific activity was found in liver, adipose tissue, and kidneys, whereas in humans, the specific activity in the preparations of adipose tissue examined was lower. A sex difference was observed in rat liver, where 4-fold higher activity was seen in microsomes from female rats. No gender differences were present in any other tissue investigated. Partial purification of the hepatic system was achieved using polyethylene glycol fractionation followed by Octyl Sepharose chromatography at low detergent concentrations, whereas the enzyme was denatured after complete solubilization. The unique appearance of the enzyme activity in adipose tissue, together with the cyanide sensitivity and the failure of typical P450 inhibitors to impede the reaction, indicates that the enzyme system active in reduction of benzamidoxime and N-hydroxymelagatran formation is not of cytochrome P450 origin, but likely consists of an NADH-dependent electron transfer chain with a cyanide-sensitive protein as the terminal component.;Yes;No;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0014fc7029e9667293ba8bb6edd88777265365d

Methods We prospectively monitored all patients who underwent central line insertion guided by ultrasound from March 2018 to March 2019. An independent nurse recorded the patient's age, gender, weight and BMI, diagnosis, indication for insertion, blood pressure state, insertion time, line size, number of pricks, and arterial punctures. Results A central line was inserted in 141 patients. The author applied the WIN technique in 16 patients, while in 125 patients, the central line was inserted via the traditional technique. The success rate was 100% for the WIN technique arm with zero arterial pricks, and the mean number of needle pricks was 1.1. For the traditional technique arm, the success rate was 90% with three arterial pricks. The mean number of needle pricks was 1.38. The insertion time was 86.25 seconds and 304 seconds for the WIN technique and the standard technique, respectively; this difference was statistically significant (p <0.001). Conclusion The WIN technique is feasible and could provide a safe and relatively fast alternative technique for real-time USG-CVC insertion in the PICU. The WIN technique is feasible and not inferior to the standard short-axis technique.

CVC is an invasive procedure with possible mechanical, infectious, and thrombotic complications. The complete knotting of a catheter is a rare complication. The aim of this study is to report a case of a simple tight knot 2 cm from the catheter tip. We provide insights for early identification of catheter knotting, as well as its management. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a previous history of angioplasty and non-pharmacological coronary stent in a marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery evolved to junctional bradycardia and cardiogenic shock and was transferred to the reference hospital. He had a CVC inserted in the right jugular vein; however, it did not have any blood flow. The hypothesis of catheter knotting was suggested and confirmed through a chest X-ray. Venotomy was performed and it was successfully removed. Conclusions: Knotting in CVC obstruction is a rare complication. Recognition of this complication is essential to avoid major complications, such as catheter fragmentation and venous injury. Radiological follow-up after the procedure in patients with difficult anatomy is essential, and echo-guided catheterization should be encouraged when available. Despite the rarity of a knotted intravascular catheter, it is important to note this possible late complication that must be considered in the absence of catheter blood flow.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/850124023fef362b7ca6e4a3a0e18e5045676466

Methods: The simulation model was constructed with a chicken breast, two DWP-385 water pumps, two types of tubes and a controller. An elastic rubber tourniquet and a silicone tube were connected to each water pump, which generated different continuous flows mimicking those of the pediatric internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, respectively. Both tubes were inserted into a piece of chicken breast and connected to the controller. Then, we provided a simulation program of ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion using our novel model to resident emergency medicine physicians. We also collected data on their knowledge and confidence levels regarding the procedure before and after the simulation via questionnaires utilizing a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The flow patterns of the artery and vein were well demonstrated with our model. A total of 11 resident physicians were enrolled. The knowledge and confidence regarding the discrimination of arteries and veins were significantly improved after training with our simulation model (p-value < 0.01). The subjective similarity and usefulness of our model also scored high on the questionnaire (median: 4; interquartile range in both categories: 4–5).

Staff ask draw buy dinner task middle benefit.;FullPaper;Background: Ultrasound (US)-guided internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization in newborns is usually performed in the operating room with general anesthesia. This study aimed to show that US-guided IJV catheterization can be successfully performed with local anesthesia and sedation in newborns. Methods: The files of newborn patients who underwent US-guided IJV catheterization between May 2017 and May 2020 were examined. Two groups were created according to the type of anesthesia applied during the procedure. The general characteristics of the newborns, the success of the procedure, the number of punctures, and the complication rates in both groups were compared. Results: A total of 53 newborns were included in this study. Of the 62 procedures, 30 were performed under general anesthesia (group A) and 32 were performed under sedation (group B). Twenty-six (86.6%) of the newborns in group A and 19 (59.3%) in group B were catheterized at the first puncture. The median puncture numbers in groups A and B were 1 (1-3) and 1 (1-5), respectively. All of the patients in group A were successfully catheterized (n = 30; 100%), and all but one in group B could be catheterized (n = 32; 96.8%). Conclusion: No significant differences in complications or procedural success rates were observed between newborns undergoing general anesthesia or sedation. US-guided IJV catheterization can be safely performed with sedation alone.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b065cf6feab4172a6f2cf793462efffbb7841112

Analysis development floor most there conference.;DemoPaper;&NA; Rapeseed meal (RSM) is a commonly used protein source in poultry diet but its usage is limited due to antinutritional factors, the glucosinolates (GLS) and erucic acid. The 00‐rapeseed meal (00‐RSM) is the developed variety of rapeseed with reduced GLS and erucic acid content through genetic selection. The present study was conducted with the objective of comparing the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in 00‐RSM and RSM when fed to growing broilers. Three samples of each ingredient were collected from different sources. Two hundred and fifty two day‐old male broilers (Hubbard × Hubbard) were fed a corn‐soybean meal based starter diet in crumble form from day 1 to 13. On day 14, all chicks were individually weighed and randomly distributed to 42 replicate pens (6 birds in each pen). Six test diets (2 ingredient × 3 samples) with approximately 20% crude protein were made in mash form in such a way that the 6 test ingredients served as the sole source of AA in one diet. The endogenous AAs (EAA) were determined by feeding a nitrogen‐free diet to six replicate pens. Each test diet was fed to six replicates of broiler chicks from 14 to 21 days of age. Results indicated that the SID of all AA differed (P < 0.001) among 00‐RSM samples. Among RSM samples, the SID of AA varied for arginine, methionine (P < 0.01), histidine, leucine, lysine, aspartic acid, and phenylalanine (P < 0.05). A greater (P < 0.05) SID of all AA except arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, cysteine, and glutamic acid was observed in 00‐RSM compared with RSM. In conclusion, 00‐RSM had greater SID of AA compared with RSM and it is nutritionally superior to RSM to be used in broiler diets.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08034ea4bf385311fa9b6b19c8ba5866712c892c

Nice agree church.;FullPaper;An experiment was executed to test the hypothesis that supplementation of dietary threonine (d-Thr), above NRC recommendation to diets containing poorly digestible protein source (PS) may compensate its detrimental effects on overall performance of broilers. In total, nine hundred 1-day-old mixed sex broilers (Ross-308) were randomly distributed over 6 (2 × 3) experimental diets comprising 5 replicates of 30 broilers each for 35 d. The experimental diets contain either soybean meal (SBM) or canola meal (CM) with 3 levels (100, 110, and 120% of NRC recommendation) of d-Thr. During the course of the trial (0 to 35 D), interactions (P < 0.05) between PS and d-Thr were observed for feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass, and gut health parameters. The broilers fed recommended level (100%) of d-Thr had 7 and 5% poorer FCR compared with those fed diets with 110 and 120% d-Thr, respectively. For villus height (VH), an interaction (P = 0.007) was found between PS and d-Thr level. Broilers consuming SBM diets had 22% longer villi, 10% deeper crypts, and 30% greater VH to crypt depth ratio (VCR) compared to those fed CM. The broilers fed 110% d-Thr diets had 9% lower crypt depth (CD) and 15% greater VCR compared with those fed diets containing NRC recommended levels. CM resulted in 9% lower protein digestibility with lower (P < 0.05) of some AA, whereas it was improved by 7% in broilers fed 120% d-Thr supplemented diets. The bursa and spleen weights were positively affected (P < 0.001) by PS. Threonine supplementation (10%) resulted in 25% greater thymus, 18% heavier bursa, and 30% greater infectious bursal disease titer. In conclusion, supplementation of d-Thr, above NRC recommendation, resulted in a better growth performance and carcass traits, improved ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids, better gut health, and immunity in broilers.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ea51927b1b6d79dc28a4408e52b2592ce935302

Treatments included two levels of L-Thr (100% and 125% of the requirements, Cobb 500, Cobb-Vantress), Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) (0, 500 ppb), and MP (0, 1 g/kg). As the main effects showed, AFB1 decreased breast meat yield and carcass percentage (p < 0.001), serum urea, antibody titer against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and bone density (p < 0.05), while it increased the plasma concentrations of glucose and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p < 0.05). Mycofix Plus improved the grower feed intake (FI), tibia fresh weight, and body weight (BW) to bone weight (p < 0.05). L-Threonine increased the grower FI, breast meat yield, serum aspartate transaminase (AST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (p < 0.05). There were positive interactions with breast meat yield, cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IBV titer. Of the treatments used, the combination of L-Thr and MP without AFB1 improved breast meat and carcass percentage. L-Threonine and MP significantly improved IBV titer in birds challenged with AFB1 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, L-Thr and MP were beneficial to improve immunity.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c6c509ae46c1f1e64b2cc9b73bc9af0deb0aa62

Than financial none find new.;Poster;Summary Broiler chicken production is expected to increase significantly in the next decades to satisfy the poultry meat demand of a growing world population. In this scenario, one of the most important challenges for the poultry industry is to enhance bird productivity while remaining economically and environmentally sustainable. Feeding represents the major cost in raising of broiler chickens and has important implications for environmental impact, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, improving broiler capacity in converting ingested feed into body growth, which is generally referred to as feed efficiency (often expressed through the feed conversion ratio), is fundamental to promoting a sustainable intensification of poultry production. In this review, we highlight the importance of feed efficiency improvements in terms of overall sustainability for the broiler chicken production chain. Furthermore, the potential of feed additive-based nutritional strategies, such as the dietary administration of crystalline amino acids, proteases, phytases and organic minerals, is critically discussed in the light of their role in supporting the sustainable intensification of this crucial livestock sector.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e188005418d389640276f1779a30148fb407c8b

We retrospectively analyzed the Ports evaluation and flushing procedure data between February 3, 2020 and April 3, 2020; the cases were divided into the normal group and delayed group according to the critical point of the maintenance interval of 28 days (4 weeks). We compared the incidence of catheter obstruction between the 2 groups, analyzed the causes of catheter removal events in the 2 groups, and proposed corresponding protective treatment recommendations. During the period, 329 cases were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the incidence of catheter obstruction between the 2 groups. There were 15 patients with catheter removal, 8 cases of infection, 5 cases of catheter obstruction, and 1 case of an ectopic catheter, as well as 1 case of an overturned port. During the epidemic, no hospital infections related to the Ports flushing procedure occurred. The interval of Ports flushing procedures for patients without clinical symptoms can be appropriately extended during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, once the local infection symptoms or other sources of discomfort appear, Ports assessment needs to be performed as soon as possible. Take enhanced protected and isolation measures did not increase cross-infection during outpatient's flushing procedure at non-COVID-19-designated diagnosis and treatment hospitals.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/561acd218d8f24b859c5da014272e1aaacadd933

This study was performed to evaluate performance improvements and favorable attitudes through structured cardiac ultrasound program for emergency medicine residents. Methods Retrospective observational study using the point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) database in one tertiary academic-teaching hospital emergency department has been conducted. Cardiac ultrasound education and rotation program has been implemented in emergency medicine residency program. Structured evaluation sheet for cardiac ultrasound and questionnaire toward PoCUS have been developed. An early-phase and a late-phase case were selected randomly for each participant. Two emergency medicine specialists with expertise in PoCUS evaluated saved images independently. We used a paired t-test to compare the performance score of each phase and the results of the questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between the characteristics of participants and performance improvements. Results During the study period, a total of 1,652 bedside cardiac ultrasounds were administered. Forty-six examinations conducted by 23 emergency medicine residents were randomly selected for analysis. The performance score increased from 39.5 to 56.1 according to expert A and 45.3 to 62.9 according to expert B (p-value <0.01 for both). The average questionnaire score, which was analyzed for 17 participants, showed improvement from 18.9 to 20.7 (p-value <0.01). In multivariable linear regression analysis, younger age, higher early-phase score and higher confidence had a negative association with a greater improvement of performance, while the number of examinations had a positive association.

The treatment of pediatric onco-hematological diseases is complex and requires the use of integrated multimodal therapies. Long-lasting and safe central venous access is therefore a cornerstone for any successful treatment. Methods: The aim of this work is to define pediatric guidelines about the management of CVADs in onco-hematology. A panel of experts belonging to the working groups on Infections and Supportive Therapy, Surgery and Nursing of the Italian Pediatric Hematology Oncology Association (AIEOP) revised the scientific literature systematically, scored the level of evidence and prepared these guidelines. The content of the following guidelines was approved by the Scientific Board of AIEOP. Results and Conclusions: Important innovations have been developed recently in the field of CVADs, leading to new insertion methods, new materials and new strategy in the overall management of the device, especially in the adult population. These guidelines recommend how to apply these innovations in the pediatric population, and are directed to all physicians, nurses and health personnel active in the daily management of CVADs.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey study regarding the respondents’ demographic profiles, formal and informal training in USG-CVC placement, experiences, and attitudes towards the procedure was emailed to all EPs registered with the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) between October and December 2018. Results: In total, 234/350 SCFHS-registered EPs completed the survey; the response rate was 66.9%. Most respondents (70.5%) were board-certified in emergency medicine (EM). Ninety percent indicated that US device for CVC placement assistance was available. Most EPs (78.2%) had performed USG-CVC placement; the US usage rate correlated significantly with recent graduation from residency (p=0.048). In total, 83.3% received formal training during residency. Of the 234 respondents, 53.8% felt extremely comfortable with CVC placement with USG and 19.7% without USG (p<0.01). Nevertheless, most respondents desired further USG-CVC training. Conclusion: Despite existing evidence and a consensus on its superiority over the landmark technique, USG-CVC placement has not been adopted by a small proportion of EPs into clinical practice.

To date, evidence-based criteria to inform these choices do not exist. The objective of the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters in pediatrics (miniMAGIC) was to provide guidance on device selection, device characteristics, and insertion technique for clinicians, balancing and contextualizing evidence with current practice through a multidisciplinary panel of experts., , , METHODS, The RAND Corporation and University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method was used to develop miniMAGIC, which included the following sequential phases: definition of scope and key terms, information synthesis and literature review, expert multidisciplinary panel selection and engagement, case scenario development, and appropriateness ratings by an expert panel via 2 rounds., , , RESULTS, The appropriateness of the selection, characteristics, and insertion technique of intravenous catheters commonly used in pediatric health care across age populations (neonates, infants, children, and adolescents), settings, diagnoses, clinical indications, insertion locations, and vessel visualization devices and techniques was defined. Core concepts including vessel preservation, insertion and postinsertion harm minimization (eg, infection, thrombosis), undisrupted treatment provision, and inclusion of patient preferences were emphasized., , , CONCLUSIONS, In this study, we provide evidence-based criteria for intravenous catheter selection (from umbilical catheters to totally implanted venous devices) in pediatric patients across a range of clinical indications. miniMAGIC also highlights core vascular access practices in need of collaborative research and innovation.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9209bea7d5a291bc567461a6c02b332fe3d7dc9

The use of single-lumen devices and ultrasound-guided techniques was also broadly supported. There was a lack of RCTs, and for neonates, cardiac patients, patients with difficult venous access, midline catheters, catheter-to-vein ratio, and near-infrared devices, the lack of evidence necessitated broadening the review scope., , , LIMITATIONS, Limitations include the lack of formal assessment of the quality of evidence and the lack of RCTs and systematic reviews. Consequently, clinical decision-making in certain pediatric populations is not guided by strong, evidence-based recommendations., , , CONCLUSIONS, This is the first synthesis of available evidence for the selection and insertion of VADs in pediatric patients and is important for determining the appropriateness of VADs in pediatric patients.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06b7af34db6d66fc9c270c1f8b5af24ab90ab604

We present an exceptional case of a patient with four accessory pathways with anterograde conduction and a fasciculo-ventricular fiber in whom we performed a radiofrequency ablation. A 20 year old healthy male patient was seen at the emergency room after suffering syncope. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with wide QRS complex suggestive of preexcitation. The electrophysiologic study demonstrated the presence of four atrio-ventricular accessory pathways with antegrade conduction (left lateral, right posteroseptal, right midseptal and right posterolateral). After ablation of the fourth accessory pathway, the electrocardiogram showed a persistent delta wave with a short HV interval. Atrial stimulation demonstrated decremental conduction, progressive lengthening of the AH interval and no modification in the HV interval nor in the preexcitation pattern, suggestive of the presence of a fasciculo-ventricular fiber. This exceptional case report is demonstrative of the complexity of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and the feasibility and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in a single procedure.;Yes;Yes;1998;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17480677dd990e9ef3c5f060aadd7d2e5b8ae32d

A range of experimental techniques to investigate this heterogeneity is available, and multiple modelling frameworks have been developed to describe and simulate the dynamics of heterogeneous populations. Measurement data are used to adjust computational models, which results in parameter and state estimation problems. Methods to solve these estimation problems need to take the specific properties of data and models into account. The aim of this review is to give an overview on the state of the art in estimation methods for heterogeneous cell population data and models. The focus is on models based on the population balance equation, but stochastic and individual-based models are also discussed. It starts with a brief discussion of common experimental approaches and types of measurement data that can be obtained in this context. The second part describes computational modelling frameworks for heterogeneous populations and the types of estimation problems occurring for these models.

As a technical tool, we propose conditions on boundedness and ultimate boundedness for systems with a singular perturbation, which extend the classical asymptotic stability results for singularly perturbed systems. Based on these results, we show that with common models of intracellular dynamics, the cell population is coordinated in the sense that all cells converge close to a common equilibrium point. We then study a more specific example of coupled cells which behave as bistable switches, where the intracellular dynamics are such that cells may be in one of two equilibrium points. Here, we find that the whole population is bistable in the sense that it converges to a population state where either all cells are close to the one equilibrium point, or all cells are close to the other equilibrium point. Finally, we discuss applications of these results for the robustness of cellular decision making in coupled populations.;No;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6b0ab80352eae74f213451234a43a2e48f7ca25

Between describe form remember read season., Seek less guy former evening daughter really task. Writer either relate another. Ability ask maybe will dream.;Poster;Biological oscillators naturally exhibit stochastic fluctuations in period and amplitude due to the random nature of molecular reactions. Accurately measuring the precision of noisy oscillators and the heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity across a population of cells requires single-cell recordings of sufficient length to fully represent the variability of oscillations. We found persistent, independent circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in 6-week-long bioluminescence recordings of 80 primary fibroblast cells dissociated from PER2::LUC mice and kept in vitro for 6 months. Due to the stochastic nature of rhythmicity, the proportion of cells appearing rhythmic increases with the length of interval examined, with 100% of cells found to be rhythmic when using 3-week windows. Mean period and amplitude are remarkably stable throughout the 6-week recordings, with precision improving over time. For individual cells, precision of period and amplitude are correlated with cell size and rhythm amplitude, but not with period, and period exhibits much less cycle-to-cycle variability (CV 7.3%) than does amplitude (CV 37%). The time series are long enough to distinguish stochastic fluctuations within each cell from differences among cells, and we conclude that the cells do exhibit significant heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity, which we measure using a novel statistical metric. Furthermore, stochastic modeling suggests that these single-cell clocks operate near a Hopf bifurcation, such that intrinsic noise enhances the oscillations by minimizing period variability and sustaining amplitude.;Yes;No;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3855e764ba0d8c4172bcf39823a8f84faa115fbd

Objectives: Current central venous catheter utilization in patients within pediatric cardiac ICUs is not well elucidated. We aim to describe current use of central venous catheters in a multi-institutional cohort and to explore the prevalence and risk factors for central line–associated thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infections. Design: Observational analysis. Setting: Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium hospitals. Patients: Hospitalizations with at least one cardiac ICU admission from October 2013 to July 2016. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: There were 17,846 hospitalizations and 69% included greater than or equal to one central venous catheter. Central venous catheter use was higher in younger patients (86% neonates). Surgical hospitalizations included at least one central venous catheter 88% of the time compared with 35% of medical hospitalizations. The most common location for central venous catheters was internal jugular (46%). Central venous catheters were in situ a median of 4 days (interquartile range, 2–10). There were 248 hospitalizations (2% overall, 1.8% medical, and 2.1% surgical) with at least one central line–associated thrombosis (271 total thromboses). Thrombosis was diagnosed at a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 4–14) after catheter insertion. There were 127 hospitalizations (1% overall, 1.4% medical, and 1% surgical) with at least one central line–associated bloodstream infection (136 total infections) with no association with catheter type or location. Central line–associated bloodstream infection was diagnosed at a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 8–36) after catheter insertion. Significant risk factors for central line–associated thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infection were younger age, greater surgical complexity, and total catheter days. Conclusions: Utilization of central venous catheters in pediatric cardiac ICUs differs according to indication for hospitalization. Although thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infection are infrequent complications of central venous catheter use in cardiac ICU patients, these events can have important short- and long-term consequences for patients. Total central venous catheter line days were the only modifiable risk factor identified. Future study must focus on understanding central venous catheter practices in high-risk patient subgroups that reduce the prevalence of thrombosis and central line–associated bloodstream infection.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aed1f9470697d53abea681136e7e0c78867400c7

When in-plane and syringe-free techniques are combined, advancement of the guidewire can also be visualized. We aim to introduce our supraclavicular approach for brachiocephalic vein cannulation in pediatric patients. A syringe-free and in-plane technique is used to cannulate the patients.

First-tier practices for CLABSI prevention are well established. Objective: We describe second-tier prevention practices in Israeli medical-surgical ICUs and assess their association with CLABSI rates. Methods: In June 2017, an online survey assessing infection prevention practices in general ICUs was sent to all Israeli acute-care hospitals. The survey comprised 14 prevention measures supplementary to the established measures that are standard of care for CLABSI prevention. These measures fall into 2 domains: technology and implementation. The association between the number of prevention measures and CLABSI rate during the first 6 months of 2017 was assessed using Spearman’s correlation. We used negative binomial regression to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) associated with the overall number of prevention measures and with each measure individually. Results: The CLABSI rates in 24 general ICUs varied between 0.0 and 17.0 per 1,000 central-line days. Greater use of preventive measures was associated with lower CLABSI rates (ρ, –0.70; P < .001). For each additional measure, the incidence of CLABSI decreased by 19% (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.89). Specific measures associated with lower rates were involvement of ward champions (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31–0.71), auditing of insertions by infection control staff (IRR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19–0.64), and simulation-based training (IRR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.64). Conclusion: Implementation of second-tier preventive practices was protective against CLABSI.

Author many condition rule.;Poster;Introduction: Vascular access devices are commonly inserted devices that facilitate the administration of fluids and drugs, as well as blood sampling. Despite their common use in clinical settings, these devices are prone to occlusion and failure, requiring replacement and exposing the patient to ongoing discomfort/pain, local vessel inflammation and risk of infection. A range of insertion and maintenance strategies are employed to optimize device performance; however, the evidence base for many of these mechanisms is limited and the mechanisms contributing to the failure of these devices are largely unknown. Aims/objectives: (1) To revisit existing understanding of blood, vessel physiology and biological fluid dynamics; (2) develop an understanding of the implications that different clinical practices have on vessel health, and (3) apply these understandings to vascular access device research and practice. Method: Narrative review of biomedical and bioengineering studies related to vascular access practice. Results/outcomes: Current vascular access device insertion and maintenance practice and policy are variable with limited clinical evidence to support the theoretical assumptions underpinning these regimens. This review demonstrates the physiological response to vascular access device insertion, flushing and infusion on the vein, blood components and blood flow. These appear to be associated with changes in intravascular fluid dynamics. Variable forces are at play that impact blood componentry and the endothelium. These may explain the mechanisms contributing to vascular access failure. Conclusion: This review provides an update to our current knowledge and understanding of vascular physiology and the hemodynamic response, challenging some previously held assumptions regarding vascular access device maintenance, which require further investigation.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca1b6d7547ee5f1b9c63d6804aef0069cd7833ef

It was shown that the new monosubstance reproterol, a phenylethyl-aminoalkyl-xanthine, is a very potent bronchodilator whose effect persists for at least 6 h. This bronchlysis could be proven on the basis of total and specific airways resistance as having a significantly superior and longer-lasting effect when compared with placebo. Also, when compared with orciprenaline the total broncholytic effect (areas of Raw and SRaw for effect covering time) was significantly better. No essential cardiovascular or subjective side-effects were caused by any of the three preparations inhaled in from of an aerosol equipped with metering valve. Because of its assured broncholytic efficacy and good tolerance, as well as its different forms of application (ampoules, tablets, aerosol, inhalation-solution), reproterol is a recommendable alternative in recent beta2-adrenergic achievements.;Yes;No;1977;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a4525a1998b52644835733f2e55c7f55ef9248e
391;Reproterol – A Monomolecular Combination of Orciprenaline and Theophylline: Novel Aspects of Its Mode of Action in Asthma;Art;3789,3790,3791;3790;11669;null;Bria G. Morse;R. A. Linares;None myself sit especially loss.;Them religious interesting scientist. Mr avoid interest floor. Design common reduce our would. Audience to fact seat arrive attack.;DemoPaper;Background and Objective: Reproterol is a monomolecular combination of orciprenaline and theophylline used as β-adrenergic agonist to induce bronchodilation in bronchial asthma. Since the mechanism of action of reproterol has not been investigated so far, its potential anti-inflammatory activity in asthma remains still unknown. Therefore, we have studied in vitro whether the theophylline component of the reproterol molecule might enhance the stimulatory effect of the β-adrenoceptor on cAMP production resulting in suppression of inflammatory mediator production. Methods: The effects of reproterol, orciprenaline and theophylline (10–9–10–5 M) on spontaneous cAMP (5 × 104 cells/30 min)- and on LPS (10 μg/ml)-stimulated LTB4 production (105 cells/4 h) were determined in normal monocytes in vitro. Results: Production of cAMP (n = 9) was significantly augmented in a dose-dependent manner by orciprenaline (30 ± 8%) and theophylline (28 ± 10%), but mostly by reproterol (127 ± 8%) at 10–5 M. Despite incubation with propranolol, significant stimulation of cAMP production was notable following reproterol therapy. Production of LTB4 was significantly inhibited by reproterol (–48 ± 14%) and less by theophylline (–28 ± 10%), but was stimulated by orciprenaline (+20 ± 8%) at 10–5 M. Conclusion: We conclude that reproterol exerts a strong stimulatory effect on monocyte cAMP production and a suppressive effect on LTB4 production possibly due to a synergistic mode of action on adenylate cyclase activity and inhibition of phosphodiesterases. More clinical studies in bronchial asthma will be needed to determine whether these results may translate into clinically relevant effects.;Yes;Yes;1999;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa640ba8c21c415a9d05a135bde1bd5c27ce2ffc

The cell-permeable cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP, xanthine-based KMUP-1 and KMUP-3, and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor zaprinast all inhibited TNF-α-induced increases of iNOS expression and NO levels and reversed TNF-α-induced decreases of sGCα1, sGCβ1, and PKG expression. These results imply that cGMP enhancers could have anti-proinflammatory potential in TSMCs. TNF-α also increased protein kinase A (PKA) expression and cAMP levels, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and activated productions of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-PGF1α (stable PGI2 metabolite). Dexamethasone and N-[2-(cyclohexyloxyl)-4-nitrophenyl]-methane sulfonamide (NS-398; a selective COX-2 inhibitor) attenuated TNF-α-induced expression of COX-2 and activated productions PGE2 and PGI2. However, KMUP-1 and KMUP-3 did not affect COX-2 activities and did not further enhance cAMP levels in the presence of TNF-α. It is suggested that TNF-α-induced increases of PKA expression and cAMP levels are mediated by releasing PGE2 and PGI2, the activation products of COX-2. In conclusion, xanthine-based KMUP-1 and KMUP-3 inhibit TNF-α-induced expression of iNOS in TSMCs, involving the sGC/cGMP/PKG expression pathway but without the involvement of COX-2.;Yes;Yes;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8de21e041bb7e06c5ba45646199d62041387dc1c

About public necessary ten.;FullPaper;BACKGROUND, Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists have several effects on airway function, most of which are mediated in a variety of cell types resulting in increased c-AMP-production and inhibition of inflammatory mediator production. However, their stimulating effects on cAMP-production became known to be inversed by increasing phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and degradation of cAMP. Therefore, in this study we have evaluated the efficacy of reproterol, a dual acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist and PDE-inhibitor, as compared to salbutamol and fenoterol with respect to production of cAMP and LTB4 in cultured monocytes., , , METHODS, Isolated human monocytes (10(5)/ml) were incubated (n = 9) in suspension with beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (10(-10) -10(-4) M) for 30 minutes with and without IBMX. Then, cAMP production was determined following treatment with Triton-X100. Production of LTB4 was measured following incubation of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for 4 hrs in the presence of LPS (10 mg/ml). cAMP and LTB subset 4 were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme immunoassay., , , RESULTS, At 10(-5) M, production of cAMP was significantly stimulated by reproterol > fenoterol > salbutamol in a dose-dependent manner to an extent of *128%, *65%, 13% (*p<0.04) respectively. In contrast, LTB4-production was inhibited significantly to a similar degree by salbutamol and reproterol in a dose-dependent manner by 59% and 49% (10(-5) M, p<0.03), respectively, with decreasing inhibition (15%) after fenoterol. Following co-incubation with IBMX, cAMP production only increased significantly (p<0.002) after fenoterol (+110%) compared to salbutamol (+29%) and reproterol (+50%) (ANOVA, p<0.001)., , , CONCLUSION, These data suggest effects of the theophylline constituent of reproterol to inhibit adenylyl cyclase induced phosphodiesterase activity. The advantageous synergistic effects of reproterol on cAMP-production need to be further explored in trials.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef220e827972e9b1253a007977644ccf9c0c8d45

While more and more scientific research of bioelectromagnetic phenomena is focusing on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses, characterization of those effects is far from complete. In this paper, a synthesis of experimental studies from the point of computational modeling is presented. The complexity of the experiments requires a numerical rather than an analytical approach. Solving Maxwell’s equations using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a necessary step in visualizing and understanding broadband response. The advantages of this method include having almost no limits in the description of geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated material, numerical robustness, and appropriateness for the computer technology of today. Some of the results of the computation and their importance in future experimental design are discussed. Improvements in the computational modeling and dielectric material description are suggested. This paper aims at justifying a scientific basis for UWB exposure safety standards relevant for setting the non-ionizing UWB radiation exposure guidelines. The results of this research will be of interest to people who work with electronic devices involving UWB radiation.;Yes;No;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/231ea690f0ae2b96ef885442dba6887da3016ea7

HP/UWB pulses typically have durations on the order of nanoseconds, rise times of picoseconds and amplitudes around 100 kV m−1. This article reviews current research on biological effects from HP/UWB exposure. The different references were classified according to endpoints (cardiovascular system, central nervous system, behavior, genotoxicity, teratology …). The article also reviews the aspects of mechanisms of interactions and tissue damage as well as the numerical work that has been done for studying HP/UWB pulse propagation and pulse energy deposition inside biological tissues. The mechanisms proposed are the molecular conformation change, the modification of chemical reaction rates, membrane excitation and breakdown and direct electrical forces on cells or cell constituents, and the energy deposition. As regards the penetration of biological matter and the deposited energy, mainly computations were published. They have shown that the EM field inside the biological matter is strongly modified compared to the incident EM field and that the energy absorption for HP/UWB pulses occurs in the same way as for continuous waves. However, the energy carried by a HP/UWB pulse is very low and the deposited energy is low. The number of published studies dealing with the biological effects is small and only a few pointed out slight effects. It should be further noted that the animal populations used in the studies were not always large, the statistical analyses not always relevant and the teams involved in this research rather limited in number.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6a95310a61f32ea7f7d8b7d40a9f38e0447affe

Systems emitting High Power Microwave Ultra Wide Band (HPM/UWB) pulses are developed for both military and civilian applications. The knowledge of the biological effects of this type of radiation is crucial for the protection of the staffs involved in UWB system development but also within the framework of their future uses. As no exposure standard exists, the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis has initiated a research program in this area. This program was constituted firstly by a bibliographical survey on the damage mechanisms, the dosimetry and the biological effects. At the sight of the results, it has been considered necessary to measure HPM/UWB pulse propagation in tissue-mimicking phantom materials as mainly numerical works were done on this topic. Indeed the question of the electromagnetic field amplitude in biological tissues and of the loss of energy along its propagation is crucial for the determination of damage mechanisms that can be expected. In this purpose, D-dot probes were used to measure the electric displacement field and set into materials that possess the dispersive dielectric properties of human soft tissues over the microwave frequency range, from 100 MHz to 3 GHz. Cubes of phantom materials containing D-dot were exposed to HPM/UWB pulses which have the following characteristics: a sub-nanosecond rise time, an electric field amplitude of 350 kV m-1 and a pulse duration of 3 ns. This paper will present the results of the bibliographical survey and of these experiments. Additionally, at our best knowledge, no studies dealing with the impact of HPM/UWB pulses on Active Implementable Medical Devices (AIMDs) were published. Consequently, this aspect has also been examined. Implementable Cardiac Pacemaker (ICP) was selected as AIMD since it is the most frequently implemented and it has to maintain vital functions. A bibliographic study was done to determine the in vitro experimental protocol. This latter was based, in particular, on the work performed to establish standards for the exposure of people bearing AIMDs to electromagnetic fields, on studies in the context of EMP simulator and also on studies achieved for UHF frequency range. The effects of HPM/UWB pulses on an ICP were investigated and both synchronous and asynchronous pacing modes were tested. The experimental results will also be presented.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e779b9b0ef3bd10d2367169d5213bff60eff513

It was a 58-month retrospective observational study. The setting was multivalent PICU with 20 beds at a tertiary children's hospital. The subjects were PICU residents undergoing training in central venous catheter placement. During the study period, 22 residents were enrolled in the study, and 1,157 catheter placement procedures (485 central venous, 605 peripherally inserted central venous, 57 hemodialysis, and 10 “other” types of catheter placement procedures) were analyzed. The total success rate was 82.7%. After ultrasound-guided training simulation in catheter placement, the residents' learning curve for the procedure rose from 71% in the clinical setting at the first trial to 75% at the fourth trial and 80% by the 24th trial.

However device failure and complications rates are high. Over 2½ years, a child requiring parenteral nutrition and associated vascular access dependency due to ‘short gut syndrome’ (intestinal failure secondary to gastroschisis and resultant significant bowel resection) had ten CVADs inserted, with ninesubsequently failing. This resulted in multiple anaesthetics, invasive procedures, injuries, vascular depletion, interrupted nutrition, delayed treatment and substantial healthcare costs. A conservative estimate of the institutional costs for each insertion, or rewiring, of her tunnelled CVAD was $A10 253 (2016 Australian dollars). These complications and device failures had significant negative impact on the child and her family. Considering the commonality of conditions requiring prolonged vascular access, these failures also have a significant impact on international health service costs.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/612e0227ee2055f00669d34b764ddd31378d51e3

Herein, we describe the multiple indications for CVC use and the different devices available for central venous access. Given the prevalent use of CVCs, healthcare systems are focused on reducing complications from their use, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). The most up-to-date information available sheds light on best practices and future areas of investigation. Recent findings Large systematic reviews of randomized trials suggest that ultrasound guidance for placement of CVCs in children is safer than using blind technique, at least for internal jugular vein access. Appropriate catheter tip placement is associated with decreased complications. Furthermore, the prophylactic use of ethanol lock between cycles of parenteral nutrition administration has reduced the rates of CLABSI. A recent randomized trial in pediatric CVCs showed a benefit with antibiotic-coated CVCs. Summary Based on the available evidence, multiple techniques for CVC placement are still valid, including the landmark technique based on practitioner experience, but ultrasound guidance has been shown to decrease complications from line placement. Adherence to CVC care protocols is essential in reducing infectious complications.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9861b3b22dcb529d2bbbeaf32619d0f1b8f65c9

However, there are many problems, such as lecture-dominated rather than process-oriented, de-contextualization of training, and the flow of training activities not visualized in the system. The author proposes to use workflow technology to tackle these problems. This paper builds a new training paradigm which is oriented to work process by integrating workflow technology into e-training, and develops workflow-enabled e-training course, activity structure and system architecture to support training. This novel system makes the training more relevant for the trainee, and enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of e-training.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6c6f2b09f4af24464ec26c227a0f8e7789db065

There is currently no consensus on the complement or scope of care delivered by these providers, nor is there a repository of studies that evaluate the various models of care. We conducted a rapid scoping review to identify and map what care provider models and interventions in LTCH have been evaluated to improve quality of life, quality of care, and health outcomes of residents. Methods We conducted this review over 10-weeks of English language, peer-reviewed studies published from 2010 onward. Search strategies for databases (e.g., MEDLINE) were run on July 9, 2020. Studies that evaluated models of provider care (e.g., direct patient care), or interventions delivered to facility, staff, and residents of LTCH were included. Study selection was performed independently, in duplicate. Mapping was performed by two reviewers, and data were extracted by one reviewer, with partial verification by a second reviewer. Results A total of 7,574 citations were screened based on the title/abstract, 836 were reviewed at full text, and 366 studies were included. Studies were classified according to two main categories: healthcare service delivery (n = 92) and implementation strategies (n = 274). The condition/ focus of the intervention was used to further classify the interventions into subcategories. The complex nature of the interventions may have led to a study being classified in more than one category/subcategory. Conclusion Many healthcare service interventions have been evaluated in the literature in the last decade. Well represented interventions (e.g., dementia care, exercise/mobility, optimal/appropriate medication) may present opportunities for future systematic reviews. Areas with less research (e.g., hearing care, vision care, foot care) have the potential to have an impact on balance, falls, subsequent acute care hospitalization.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a461a8e1e068022edb0db2c1b748125027d61a22

The aims of this study were to explore the experiences and acceptability of Scottish and Portuguese older adults of undertaking a home-based foot, ankle and lower limb exercise intervention. Methods: Ten Scottish (mean age 76 years, 7 female) and fourteen Portuguese (mean age 66 years, 12 female) community-dwelling older adults undertook the programme for one week, followed by focus group discussions (2-6 people per group), guided by a semi-structured interview guide. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seven themes were identified:Assessment, Group exercise taster, Home based exercise; Footfall programme kit, Midweek phone call, Reasons for participation and the Research Process. Programme components, support telephone calls and research procedures were generally well accepted by participants and they valued having a contribution to the design. They preferred a blended home and intermittent group-based programme format for motivation and progression and recommended changes to some of the exercises and equipment to reduce barriers to participation. Some cultural differences emerged, including importance of the functional assessments for Portuguese participants, time issues and difficulty in completion of the exercise diary, reflecting lower literacy levels. Conclusions: Participants found the programme acceptable but preferred a blended home and occasional group-based programme for adherence and motivation. A strong educational component to improve health literacy and simple paperwork completion to avoid data loss in future studies with Portuguese older adults is important.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4cf4fcdec4df0c978661385cde6f3fb3268014f1

The importance of rigorous intervention development prior to formal evaluation has been acknowledged and a number of frameworks have been developed. This review explored which frameworks have been used to guide the development of rehabilitation interventions for older adults. Design Systematic scoping review. Setting Studies were not limited for inclusion based on setting. Participants Studies were included that featured older adults (>65 years of age). Interventions Studies were included that reported the development of a rehabilitation intervention. Primary and secondary outcome measures Data were extracted on study population, setting, type of intervention developed and frameworks used. The primary outcome of interest was the type of intervention development framework. Results Thirty-five studies were included. There was a range of underlying medical conditions including mild cognitive impairment and dementia (n=5), cardiac (n=4), stroke (n=3), falls (n=3), hip fracture (n=2), diabetes (n=2), breast cancer (n=1), Parkinson’s disease (n=1), depression (n=1), chronic health problems (n=1), osteoarthritis (n=1), leg ulcer (n=1), neck pain (n=1) and foot problems (n=1). The intervention types being developed included multicomponent, support based, cognitive, physical activities, nursing led, falls prevention and occupational therapy led. Twelve studies (34%) did not report using a framework. Five frameworks were reported with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions being the most frequently cited (77%, n=17). Conclusion At present, the MRC framework is the most popular for developing rehabilitation interventions for older adults. Many studies do not report using a framework. Further, specific guidance to assist this complex field of rehabilitation research is required.;Yes;No;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1739a66a21f48001afe108251d64dc7cf3255282

Podiatrists diagnose and treat a wide range of problems affecting the feet, ankles and lower limbs. However, the effectiveness of podiatry interventions to prevent falls in older people is unknown. This systematic review examined podiatry interventions for falls prevention delivered in the community and in care homes. Methods systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched multiple electronic databases with no language restrictions. Randomised or quasi-randomised-controlled trials documenting podiatry interventions in older people (aged 60+) were included. Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. TiDieR guidelines guided data extraction and where suitable statistical summary data were available, we combined the selected outcome data in pooled meta-analyses. Results from 35,857 titles and 5,201 screened abstracts, nine studies involving 6,502 participants (range 40–3,727) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were single component podiatry (two studies), multifaceted podiatry (three studies), or multifactorial involving other components and referral to podiatry component (four studies). Seven studies were conducted in the community and two in care homes. Quality assessment showed overall low risk for selection bias, but unclear or high risk of detection bias in 4/9 studies. Combining falls rate data showed significant effects for multifaceted podiatry interventions compared to usual care (falls rate ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.61, 0.99]); and multifactorial interventions including podiatry (falls rate ratio: 0.73 [95% CI 0.54, 0.98]). Single component podiatry interventions demonstrated no significant effects on falls rate. Conclusions multifaceted podiatry interventions and multifactorial interventions involving referral to podiatry produce significant reductions in falls rate. The effect of multi-component podiatry interventions and of podiatry within multifactorial interventions in care homes is unknown and requires further trial data.

This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and updated in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (August 2017); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2017, Issue 8); and MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers to August 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing falls in older people in residential or nursing care facilities, or hospitals. Data collection and analysis One review author screened abstracts; two review authors screened full‐text articles for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We calculated rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for outcomes such as risk of falling (number of people falling). We pooled results where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. Main results Thirty‐five new trials (77,869 participants) were included in this update. Overall, we included 95 trials (138,164 participants), 71 (40,374 participants; mean age 84 years; 75% women) in care facilities and 24 (97,790 participants; mean age 78 years; 52% women) in hospitals. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low‐quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. Only the falls outcomes for the main comparisons are reported here. Care facilities Seventeen trials compared exercise with control (typically usual care alone). We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; 2002 participants, 10 studies; I² = 76%; very low‐quality evidence). Exercise may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 2090 participants, 10 studies; I² = 23%; low‐quality evidence). There is low‐quality evidence that general medication review (tested in 12 trials) may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.35; 2409 participants, 6 studies; I² = 93%) or the risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09; 5139 participants, 6 studies; I² = 48%). There is moderate‐quality evidence that vitamin D supplementation (4512 participants, 4 studies) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; I² = 62%), but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; I² = 42%). The population included in these studies had low vitamin D levels. Multifactorial interventions were tested in 13 trials. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (RaR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18; 3439 participants, 10 studies; I² = 84%; very low‐quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; 3153 participants, 9 studies; I² = 42%; low‐quality evidence). Hospitals Three trials tested the effect of additional physiotherapy (supervised exercises) in rehabilitation wards (subacute setting). The very low‐quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls (RaR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.34; 215 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%), or whether it reduces the risk of falling (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93; 83 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%). We are uncertain of the effects of bed and chair sensor alarms in hospitals, tested in two trials (28,649 participants) on rate of falls (RaR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) or risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.24; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Multifactorial interventions in hospitals may reduce rate of falls in hospitals (RaR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 44,664 participants, 5 studies; I² = 52%). A subgroup analysis by setting suggests the reduction may be more likely in a subacute setting (RaR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; 3747 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the risk of falling (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 39,889 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions In care facilities: we are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but not risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls; they may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. In hospitals: we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls or whether it reduces the risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of providing bed sensor alarms on the rate of falls or risk of falling. Multifactorial interventions may reduce rate of falls, although subgroup analysis suggests this may apply mostly to a subacute setting; we are uncertain of the effect of these interventions on risk of falling.;No;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4cae810ce4c8c934b4b50dd4d70d002a897a839

Yet no universal agreement exists on the diagnosis of this condition, or when and how foot orthoses should be prescribed. The aim of this study was to garner consensus and agreement among podiatrists on the use of FOs for paediatric flexible pes planus. Methods A three round Delphi consensus survey was undertaken with 15 podiatry experts from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Round One gathered consensus on the diagnosis and intervention into paediatric pes planus with specific questions on types of FOs and prescription variables used. Round Two and Three were based on answers from Round One and gathered agreement (rationale for choices) on a five point Likert scale. 70% of respondents had to agree to a statement for it to be accepted as consensus or agreement. Results Consensus and agreement was achieved for 83 statements directing the diagnosis of pes planus (using FPI-6 and/or rearfoot measures), common signs and symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, abnormal gait and other functional concerns) that direct when to intervene into paediatric flexible pes planus. Prefabricated orthoses were the preferred intervention where adequate control is gained with their use. When customised orthoses are prescribed, a vertical [heel] cast pour (71.4%) and minimal arch fill (76.9%) are the prescription variables of choice, plus or minus additional variables (i.e., medial heel (Kirby) skive, the use of a University of California Biomechanical Laboratory device or a medial flange) dependent on level of disorder and plane of excessive motion. Conclusions This study identified consensus and agreement on a series of diagnosis methods and interventions for the paediatric flexible pes planus. A clinical protocol was developed from the resultant consensus statements which provides clinicians with a series of evidenced-informed statements to better guide them on when, how and why FOs are used specific to this population.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0418178a8dcd8489ba85909c86f82886f2b2d65a

Objective The study objective was to quantify muscle function, gait, and postural control at 3 and 6 months after discharge in people who were recovering from critical illness and who were ventilated for 7 days or more. Design This was a nested longitudinal study with continuous inclusion of individuals over a 2‐year period and with age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Methods Twenty‐four people were tested at 3 months after ICU discharge; 16 of them (67%) were reevaluated at 6 months (post‐ICU group). Healthy controls (n = 12) were tested at a single time point. Muscle function of the knee extensors (KEs), plantar flexors (PFs), and dorsiflexors (DFs) was assessed on a dynamometer. Gait was measured using an electronic walkway, and postural control was measured with 2 portable force plates. Results Muscle weakness was observed across all muscle groups at 3 months, with the greatest strength reductions in the ankle PFs (45%) and DFs (30%). Muscle power was reduced in the PFs and DFs but was not reduced in the KEs. Gait in the post‐ICU group was characterized by a narrower step, longer stride, and longer double‐support time than in the controls. Improvements were found in KE strength and in stride time and double‐support time during gait at 6 months. Leg muscle strength and power had moderate associations with gait velocity, step width, and stride length (r = .44‐.65). Limitations The small heterogeneous sample of people with a high level of function was a limitation of this study. Conclusions Muscle strength and power were impaired at 6 months after ICU discharge and were associated with gait parameters. Future studies are needed to examine the role of muscle strength and power training in post‐ICU rehabilitation programs to improve mobility.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f796592ed85719db170f4e91c311982eff681447
1606;A more holistic view could contribute to our understanding of ‘silent hypoxaemia’ in Covid‐19 patients;Algorithms;9127,9128,9129;9127;13001;null;C. Ren;E. Horrocks;Force play believe.

Young beautiful quickly speech this per sense result. Police court just., Parent professor good rest. Force conference prove task. Identify toward to.;Poster;The article written by Simonson et al. (2021), ‘Silent hypoxaemia in COVID-19 patients’, provides a comprehensive and interesting review on how hypoxaemia is related to dyspnoea.However, wewould like to address some points that need further clarification. Firstly, the terms ‘happy hypoxia’ and ‘silent hypoxia’ are based on the clinician’s perception of an expected response related to levels of oxygen saturation (SpO2 ; Tobin et al. 2020), which implies that the only symptom of hypoxaemia is dyspnoea. Dyspnoea, however, is complex and difficult to define, as it can be perceived in different ways – not only by ‘air hunger’ (Tobin, 1990). As dyspnoea is a subjective experience, it is difficult to match specific levels of arterial partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2 ) with this symptom. Indeed, a more appropriate term could be ‘asymptomatic hypoxia’, as we need to measure many variables including tissue hypoxia to be sure that it is ‘silent’. Humans have been dealing with hypoxia inmany different ways across our evolution, both as breath-hold divers (Schagatay, 2009) and as indigenous permanent inhabitants of moderate to high altitude regions of the Tibetan plateau, the Andes, Eastern Africa and North America (Huang, 2014; Simonson, 2015; West, 2019), proving that humans can thrive even in conditions of hypoxia. In addition, even in critical care patients, some levels of hypoxaemia could be accepted (permissive hypoxaemia) if tissue oxygenation is not affected (Martin & Grocott, 2013; Panwar et al. 2016). The individual response to hypoxia is highly variable; therefore it is difficult to define a precise threshold value of PaO2 and SpO2 (Tobin et al. 2020). Another important factor is timing, as the concept of acclimatization plays an important role in the response to hypoxia in order to cope with the restricted supply of oxygen (West, 2006). In COVID-19 patients, dyspnoea typically occurs 8–12 days after the onset of symptoms (Li&Ma, 2020; Zhou et al. 2020). Since it has been shown that acclimatization to high altitude takes between 4 and 8 days (Rahn & Otis, 1949), it may be possible that a similar process occurs in COVID-19 patients, having to cope with hypoxia for several days, hence reducing their oxygen consumption accordingly (West, 2006). Secondly, we would like to clarify some statements about breath-hold diving. In the review, the authors cite two references (Lindholm & Lundgren, 2006; Overgaard et al. 2006) to explain normal arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PaCO2 ) at the end of a breath-hold. Parenthetically, hyperventilation is avoided nowadays in competitive breath-hold diving, as it is a risk factor for hypoxic syncope (Pearn et al. 2015). Regardless, Overgaard et al. (2006) found end-tidal partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PET,CO2 ) at the end of breath-holding (at different lung volumes) ranging between 45.7 and 50.2 mmHg, which is not in the normal range. A classical study on exhaled gases (Liner & Linnarsson, 1994) found a baseline PET,CO2 of 39 mmHg, which, after a surface breath-hold, had gone up to 46mmHg, while it was 45mmHg after a simulated 20 m dive. Recently, PaCO2 was measured at 40 m depth, and it was found that baseline values of 37.7 mmHg had increased to 42mmHg at depth (Bosco et al. 2018), but these were not maximal-effort dives. Competitive breath-hold divers repeatedly expose themselves to hypercapnia and hypoxia, which increases tolerance to these stimuli due to a blunted ventilatory response to hypercapnia and/or hypoxia (Ferretti et al. 1991). During a breath-hold, PaO2 will continue to drop as long as apnoea is extended, while PaCO2 concomitantly rises, causing hypoxiaand hypercapnia-induced chemoreceptor activity in carotid and aortic bodies (Parkes, 2006). The resulting neural activity causes involuntary contractions of the diaphragm and inspiratory muscles, known as involuntary breathing movements (IBM; Hentsch & Ulmer, 1984). While untrained individuals may terminate apnoea shortly after the onset of IBM’s, competitive freedivers can consciously suppress this respiratory sensory information due to training-induced psychological tolerance until discomfort and/or signs of asphyxia (tunnel vision, hearing distortion) indicates them to break apnoea, before losing consciousness (Schagatay, 2009). Thus, in untrained individuals, the breaking point of apnoea will most likely be influenced by hypercapnia alone, while the combination of both hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hypercapnia, will be the determining factor for competitive freedivers. Freedivers also possess a powerful "diving response" which efficiently reduces metabolism and oxygen consumption (Schagatay, 2009). The responses to extreme hypoxia and hypercapnia are not only a feature of elite breath-hold divers, as studies show that this adaptation can be trained (Hentsch & Ulmer, 1984; Engan et al. 2013). Breath-holding therefore seems to be a good in vivo model to understand severe hypoxia, which may be useful to test hypotheses regarding the ventilatory drive on healthy individuals. Additionally, when hypoxia occurs, an early response is the rapid splenic contraction which elevates haematocrit. This response has been observed during breath-holding (Baković et al. 2003; Schagatay et al. 2005), at high altitude (Purdy et al. 2019; Schagatay et al. 2020) and under hypobaric hypoxia (Richardson et al. 2008; Lodin-Sundström & Schagatay, 2010). It allows an increase in oxygen blood content by 10%without any changes in SpO2 . So far, this response has not been studied in clinical situations related to hypoxia, but it was evident in drowning victims (Haffner et al. 1994) and could have importance in clinical conditions. Wewould like to remark on an observation of the authors in regard to the lack of an excessive ventilatory response that could reduce self-induced lung injury (Mascheroni et al. 1988; Brochard et al. 2017). We believe that a more holistic view that includes our natural defence mechanisms against hypoxia would be fruitful for better understanding of asymptomatic hypoxaemia. We advocate for this more holistic view as organism survival can be addressed in multiple ways.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5c381adcac704e245d03f39c463b80573b0089f

Enough analysis open activity official plant.;FullPaper;Abstract Background The Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP) program has delivered a specialty-team based first-episode service (FES) since 2006 in New Haven. In 2015, STEP launched a 4-year early detection (ED) campaign (Mindmap), adapted from the Scandinavian TIPS approach, to shorten Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) in a 10-town catchment (popn. 400,000). Methods Mindmap’s social-ecological model targeted demand (delays in identifying illness and help-seeking) and supply (delays in referring to and providing FES) side constituents of DUP. Mindmap used mass and social media messaging, professional detailing, and rapid triage of referrals. DUP was measured as the time between the onset of psychosis and initiation of antipsychotic treatment (DUP1) and FES care (DUP2). A control FES (PREP, Boston) supported the quasi-experimental design. Quantile regression was used to interrogate the impact of the campaign across the full range of DUP. The campaign was launched in 2015, after a one-year baseline. Results The third quartile of DUP1 fell significantly at the intervention site in the pre- vs. post-campaign period (329 to 185 days, p=0.03). A time-series analysis revealed a cumulative effect of the campaign over time i.e. for each year of campaigning a 46-day reduction was achieved at STEP. DUP1 at the other quartiles and DUP2 across all quartiles showed a consistent trend of reduction over time at STEP, but this did not reach conventional statistical significance. At PREP both DUP1 & DUP2 remain unchanged, and comparable to baseline levels at STEP. Discussion Mindmap has shown promise in reducing delays to care and this is the first controlled demonstration of DUP reduction in a U.S. community setting. Additional data on help-seeking events and pathways to care and social media metrics will be presented as mediating variables. Mindmap was an early detection campaign hosted by an established FES and targeting a defined geographic catchment to recruit all incident cases.

The authors focus on the most common prescription weight-loss drugs and their potential interactions with medications frequently used in dental practice, and they include recommendations for modification in patient care., , , METHODS, The authors reviewed the literature regarding interactions between weight-loss drugs and medications commonly used in dentistry, including patient-treatment considerations. They also address the interactions of greatest clinical concern that have a high-quality evidence-based foundation in either randomized controlled clinical trials or meta-analyses., , , CONCLUSIONS, Dental treatment can be performed and medications commonly used in dentistry can be administered safely to patients taking orlistat, an inhibitor of fat absorption. The same may not be true, however, for other weight-loss medications that modify the central nervous system neurotransmission of norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin. OHCPs should be aware of the potential theoretical and pharmacokinetic risks relative to the actual clinical and reported risks for hypertension and cardiotoxicity in particular., , , PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS, Recognition and avoidance of potential weight-loss drug interactions, especially those with medications commonly used in dentistry, can help clinicians optimize patient treatment while emphasizing patient safety.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9b61a61a603fb3b12937d53034ed1772bb19a71

Dental practice is eminently invasive and involves close and routine contact with secretions; as such, it is potentially prone to the occurrence of adverse events. Various patient safety studies have been developed in the last two decades, but mostly in the hospital setting due to the organizational complexity, severity of the cases, and diversity and specificity of the procedures. The objective was to identify and explore studies on patient safety in Dentistry. An integrative literature review was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus via Portal Capes, and the Regional Portal of the Virtual Health Library, using the terms patient safety and dentistry in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, starting in 2000. The research cycle in patient safety was used, as proposed by the World Health Organization to classify studies. We analyzed 91 articles. The most common adverse events were allergies, infections, diagnostic delay or failure, and technical error. Measures to mitigate the problem highlight the need to improve communications, encourage reporting, and search for tools to assist the management of care. The authors found a lack of studies on implementation and assessment of the impact of proposals for improvement. Dentistry has made progress in patient safety but still needs to transpose the results into practice, where efforts are crucial to prevent adverse events.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b7bcd288305e8537a27b8daadb741a501218417

Now radio dark military a.;DemoPaper;The key regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia and inflammation (hypoxia inducible factor, HIF, and nuclear factor-kappa B, NF-κB, respectively) are evolutionarily conserved and share significant crosstalk. Tissues often experience hypoxia and inflammation concurrently at the site of infection or injury due to fluid retention and immune cell recruitment that ultimately reduces the rate of oxygen delivery to tissues. Inflammation can induce activity of HIF-pathway genes, and hypoxia may modulate inflammatory signaling. While it is clear that these molecular pathways function in concert, the physiological consequences of hypoxia-induced inflammation and how hypoxia modulates inflammatory signaling and immune function are not well established. In this review, we summarize known mechanisms of HIF and NF-κB crosstalk and highlight the physiological consequences that can arise from maladaptive hypoxia-induced inflammation. Finally, we discuss what can be learned about adaptive regulation of inflammation under chronic hypoxia by examining adaptive and maladaptive inflammatory phenotypes observed in human populations at high altitude. We aim to provide insight into the time domains of hypoxia-induced inflammation and highlight the importance of hypoxia-induced inflammatory sensitization in immune function, pathologies, and environmental adaptation.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cbedc6f24ac8fe2b5771798ed10da8331b334731

It has been previously documented that dental patients do not always report an accurate medication list. The aims of this study were to determine dental patients' perceptions regarding the importance and likelihood of accurately disclosing prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), and herbal/supplement medications to their OHCP. A voluntary patient survey was administered from October 2015 through March 2016 to new dental patients at the Creighton University School of Dentistry student-operated clinic. Of 300 surveys distributed, 217 were found to be complete for inclusion in the evaluation (response rate 72.3%). Of the responding patients, 75.6%, 69.1%, and 63.6% reported believing it was very important to inform their dentists of their prescribed, OTC, and herbal/supplement medications, respectively. Additionally, 80.7%, 71.4%, and 62.7% reported that they always informed their dentists of all their prescribed, OTC, and herbal/supplement medications, respectively. Although the majority of these patients agreed on the importance of reporting medication information to their OHCP and reported doing so, this survey found room for improvement, especially regarding OTC and herbal/supplement medications. It is imperative that both the pharmacist and OHCP educate dental and pharmacy students to inform patients of the importance of providing an accurate and complete medication history to ensure the safest possible delivery of their dental treatment.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5800c5adda8b9fa8590576a6ee9a993a9baeca2

Risk factors, histopathological characterization, pathophysiology, prevalence, and management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, and few studies have addressed these issues.Areas covered:This article reviews the current evidence regarding post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on the potential risk factors, histopathology, pathophysiology, functional and tomographic features, and potential therapeutic modalities. A search on the issue was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO databases and the Cochrane library between 1 December 2019, and 25 January 2021. Studies were reviewed and relevant topics were incorporated into this narrative review. Expert opinion: Pulmonary sequelae may occur secondary to COVID-19, which needs to be included as a potential etiology in the current differential diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, serial clinical, tomographic, and functional screening for pulmonary fibrosis is recommended after COVID-19, mainly in patients with pulmonary involvement in the acute phase of the disease. Further studies are necessary to determine the risk factors, markers, pathophysiology, and appropriate management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/646e6fa151c56e2454f89d1cdc766ba3b9ebe0bd

Methods 144 individuals participated in the present study and were randomly allocated to three mask groups of 48 (N95, SURGICAL, and NO MASK) with two exercise subgroups for each mask group (MAX, n = 24; SUB, n = 24) for both sexes. Participants in each experimental group (N95SUB, N95MAX; SURSUB, SURMAX; SUB, MAX) were assessed for their hemodynamic and hematologic function at baseline and during recovery after exercise. Results No significant differences were noted for either hemodynamic or hematologic function at post-exercise as compared to baseline with regard to mask modality (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) for maximal intensity were significantly greater at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to SURGICAL (P < 0.05). No differences were noted for hemodynamic and hematologic function with N95 and SURGICAL compared to NOMASK for either intensity (P > 0.05). Females showed significantly greater HR values at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to NO MASK, but no significant differences were noted for hematological function between sexes (P > 0.05). Conclusion Our findings show that wearing a face mask (N95/surgical) while exercising has no detrimental effects on hemodynamic/hematologic function in both males and females, and suggest that wearing a mask, particularly a surgical mask, while exercising during the ongoing pandemic is safe and poses no risk to individual’s health. Future studies examining physiological responses to chronic exercise with masks are warranted.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ec12cb7ba4225764ba0be900a9d4647b1cf9e06

There is a lack of clear consensus on when to switch patients from trials of noninvasive therapies to invasive mechanical ventilation. We investigated the effect of the timing of intubation from the time of admission on the clinical outcome of CARDS. Aim and objective The aim and objective was to analyze the effect of timing of intubation early (within 48 hours of admission to critical care unit) versus delayed (after 48 hours of admission to critical care unit) on mortality in severe CARDS patients. Materials and methods A retrospective observational study performed in a 28-bedded COVID-19 intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India. All patients admitted between April 1, 2020, and October 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 (RT-PCR positive) requiring mechanical ventilation were included in the study. Results The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Among 2,230 patients that were admitted to the hospital, 525 required critical care (23.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 162 patients and 147 (28%) of critical care admission were included in the study cohort after exclusion. Seventy-five patients (51%) were intubated within 48 hours of critical care admission (early group) and 72 (48.9%) were intubated after 48 hours of critical care admission (delayed group). With regards to the total of 147 included patients; male patients were 74.1% with a median age of 59 years (interquartile range, 51–68 years). Diabetes (44.9%) and hypertension (43.5%) were the most common comorbidities. Higher admission acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores and lower absolute lymphocyte count were observed in patients intubated within 48 hours. The early intubated group had a mortality of 60% whereas the same was observed as 77.7% in delayed intubation group, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). Conclusion Current study concludes that early intubation is associated with improved survival rates in severe CARDS patients.

Data collected under the National Clinical Registry for COVID-19 (NCRC) were analysed to describe the differences in demographic and clinical features of COVID-19 patients recruited during these two successive waves. Methods: The NCRC, launched in September 2020, is an ongoing multicentre observational initiative, which provided the platform for the current investigation. Demographic, clinical, treatment and outcome data of hospitalized, confirmed COVID-19 patients were captured in an electronic data portal from 41 hospitals across India. Patients enrolled during September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 and February 1 to May 11, 2021 constituted participants of the two successive waves, respectively. Results: As on May 11, 2021, 18961 individuals were recruited in the registry, 12059 and 6903 reflecting in-patients from the first and second waves, respectively. Mean age of the patients was significantly lower in the second wave [48.7 (18.1) yr vs. 50.7 (18.0) yr, P<0.001] with higher proportion of patients in the younger age group intervals of <20, and 20-39 yr. Approximately 70 per cent of the admitted patients were ≥ 40 yr of age in both waves of the pandemic. The proportion of males were slightly lower in second wave as compared to the first [4400 (63.7%) vs. 7886 (65.4%), P=0.02]. Commonest presenting symptom was fever in both waves. In the second wave, a significantly higher proportion [2625 (48.6%) vs. 4420 (42.8%), P<0.003] complained of shortness of breath, developed ARDS [422(13%) vs. 880 (7.9%), P<0.001], required supplemental oxygen [1637 (50.3%) vs. 4771 (42.7%), P<0.001], and mechanical ventilation [260 (15.9%) vs. 530 (11.1%), P<0.001]. Mortality also significantly increased in the second wave [OR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52)] in all age groups except in <20 yr. Interpretation & conclusions: The second wave of COVID-19 in India was slightly different in presentation than the first wave, with a younger demography, lesser comorbidities, and presentation with breathlessness in greater frequency.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f11efb4705a74bf07e37de57f63d5ea8f4df48ad

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs (RT-PCR) was detected in 72% of the participants, in the rest it was highly probable in terms of the aggregate parameters. Diagnostics of COVID-19 and its severity, the appointment of a standard examination and treatment were carried out in accordance with the Temporary Methodological Recommendations of the Ministry of Health of Russia, version 8 of 09.03.2020. This publication presents the results of using B. bifidum 1 (3 capsules twice a day for 10 days) during the peak of clinical manifestations (in a hospital)., , , RESULTS, In those who received sorbed B. bifidum 1, by the 10th day of treatment, the frequency of weakness was 32% lower (RR 0.55 [95% CI 0.240.73], OR 0.25 [0.110.59]); hypoosmia/dysgeusia by 22% (RR 0.42 [0.050.65], OR 0.40 [0.170.90]) and cough by 24% (RR 0.39 [0.070.60], OR 0.38 [0.170.84]). B. bifidum 1 reduced the average duration of weakness by 3 days [1.14.9], hypoosmia/dysgeusia by 3.2 days [1.35.1], cough by 1.9 days [0.43,4], dyspnea by 1.8 days [0.72.7], diarrhea by 1.7 days [0.13.5]; reduced the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 20% (RR 0.77 [0.240.93], OR 0.18 [0.050.68]). Due to the deterioration of the condition and the increase in the symptoms of respiratory failure, additional treatment was required less often by 24% (p=0.005). After the end of the intervention, the frequency of virologic debridement, levels of CRP, leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets and the degree of lung damage on computed tomography did not statistically differ in the compared groups. No side effects of B. bifidum 1 (5108 KОЕ) have been identified., , , CONCLUSION, The use of sorbed B. bifidum 1 (5108 KОЕ) improved the well-being of patients without risk factors with moderate viral (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and reduced the duration of diarrheal syndrome in a short time. The safety profile of their use was high. More research is needed to clarify the anti-inflammatory effects of the sorbed probiotic.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ce77e96fd056cb7e835beee9c806d979bd73f6c

Such was the scale of the respiratory support needed during the first wave of the pandemic, that recruitment of non-respiratory clinical staff was essential to help deal with the growing number of cases. It quickly became apparent that it was vital to rapidly equip these healthcare professionals with appropriate physiological knowledge and practical skills if therapies were to be applied effectively. Furthermore, the unravelling of unusual clinical features of COVID-19, further highlighted a need for knowledge of long-established principles of respiratory physiology. An online digital educational resource, or “respiratory learning tool kit” was developed with interactive material including visualisations, animations, and pathophysiological examples to facilitate understanding. The learning outcomes were centred on physiological principles, essential for understanding the pathophysiology relating to COVID-19, and management and treatment. Topics included principles of gas exchange, gas transport, homeostasis and central control of respiration. These basic physiological principles were linked to pathophysiology and clinical skills around oxygen administration and non-invasive supports such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). From the degree of engagement and evaluation comments, it was clear that the resource successfully achieved its aim—to increase physiological knowledge and its practical understanding, enabling healthcare professionals to practice with confidence in such an uncertain environment.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d20504b7e04cb876ea7f3a140b8813646ae5ffa

In this single center case series, we characterized the initial clinical presentation in 180 patients with mild COVID-19 and defined the earliest predictors of subsequent deterioration and need for hospitalization. Three broad patient phenotypes and four symptom clusters were characterized, differentiated by varying risk for adverse outcomes. Among 14 symptoms assessed, subjective shortness of breath (SOB) most strongly associated with adverse outcomes (odds ratio (OR) 21.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.7–166.4; p < 0.0001). In combination, SOB and number of comorbidities were highly predictive of subsequent hospitalization (area under the curve (AUC) 92%). Additionally, initial lymphopenia (OR 21.0, 95% CI: 2.1–210.1; p = 0.002) and male sex (OR 3.5, 95% CI: 0.9–13.0; p = 0.05) were associated with increased risk of poor outcomes.

The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics—as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/349bc92c91ef2bfa22bfdd33f0665c709d31fc90

Intubation and mechanical ventilation are a strategic treatment of COVID-19 distress or hypoxia. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases through April 1, 2021, to identify relevant randomized control trials, observational studies, and case series. Results: 24 studies were included in this review. Studies were conducted in the USA, China, Spain, South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Brazil. Most patients were intubated in the intensive care unit. Rapid sequence induction was mostly used for intubation. ROX index might be utilized for the predictor of the necessity of intubation in COVID-19 patients. According to the previous studies the rate of intubation reported 5 to 88%. It was revealed that 1.4 - 44.5% of patients might be extubated. Yet obesity and age (elderly) are the only risk factors of delayed or difficult extubation. Discussion and conclusion: Acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients could require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, and hypoxia were the most important reasons for intubation. Also, increased levels of ferritin, d-dimer, and lipase in common with hypoxia are correlated with intubation and ICU admission Mortality following intubation is reported to be 15 to 36%. Awake-prone positioning in comparison to high-flow nasal oxygen therapy did not reduce the risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation. There was no association between intubation timing and mortality of infected patients. noninvasive ventilation may have survival benefits.

Among these sectors, healthcare providers and medical workers have been impacted prominently due to the massive increase in demand for medical services under unprecedented circumstances. Hence, any tool that can help the compliance with social guidelines for COVID-19 spread prevention will have a positive impact on managing and controlling the virus outbreak and reducing the excessive burden on the healthcare system. This perspective article disseminates the perspectives of the authors regarding the use of novel biosensors and intelligent algorithms embodied in wearable IoMT frameworks for tackling this issue. We discuss how with the use of smart IoMT wearables certain biomarkers can be tracked for detection of COVID-19 in exposed individuals. We enumerate several machine learning algorithms which can be used to process a wide range of collected biomarkers for detecting (a) multiple symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the dynamical likelihood of contracting the virus through interpersonal interaction. Eventually, we enunciate how a systematic use of smart wearable IoMT devices in various social sectors can intelligently help controlling the spread of COVID-19 in communities as they enter the reopening phase. We explain how this framework can benefit individuals and their medical correspondents by introducing Systems for Symptom Decoding (SSD), and how the use of this technology can be generalized on a societal level for the control of spread by introducing Systems for Spread Tracing (SST).;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1d2b2e3b5fada7d618148fa8bb4c0daa2d59617

This need is more urgent in resource-constrained settings. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Study design: The current study was conducted based on a retrospective cohort design. Methods: The participants included 665 definite cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital from February 20 to May 14, 2020. The baseline characteristics of patients were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the significant odds ratio (OR) for ICU admission. Results: Participants were aged 59.52±16.72 years, and the majority (55.6%) of them were male. Compared to non-ICU patients (n=547), the ICU patients (n=118) were older, had more baseline comorbidities, and presented more often with dyspnea, convulsion, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and less often with myalgia. Significant OR (95% CI) of ICU admission was observed for the 60-80 age group (2.42, 95%CI: 1.01; 5.79), ≥80 age group (3.73, 95%CI: 1.44; 9.42), ≥3 comorbidities (2.07, 95%CI: 1.31; 3.80), loss of consciousness (6.70, 95%CI: 2.94, 15.24), tachypnea (1.79, 95%CI: 1.03, 3.11), and SpO2<90 (5.83, 95%CI: 2.74; 12.4). Abnormal laboratory results were more common among ICU-admitted patients; in this regard, leukocytosis (4.45, 95%CI: 1.49, 13.31), lymphopenia (2.39, 95%CI: 1.30; 4.39), elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (1.99, 95%CI: 1.04; 3.83), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.25, 95%CI: 1.18-4.30) had a significant OR of ICU admission. Chest computer tomography (CT) revealed that consolidation (1.82, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.24), pleural effusion (3.19, 95%CI: 1.71, 5.95), and crazy paving pattern (8.36, 95%CI: 1.92, 36.48) had a significant OR of ICU admission.

Dyspnoea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea measures in capturing hypoxaemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea in diagnosing hypoxaemia in COVID-19 patients. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from 3 April 2020 to 13 September 2020. Dyspnoea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/−LR) for detecting hypoxaemia. In the primary analysis, hypoxaemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%; the diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea was also assessed across a range of oxygen saturation cutoffs from 92% to 97%. Results During the study period, 89/501 (17.8%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 17/89 (19.1%) were diagnosed with hypoxaemia. The presence/absence of dyspnoea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxaemia, with SN 47% (95% CI 24% to 72%), SP 80% (95% CI 68% to 88%), NPV 86% (95% CI 75% to 93%), PPV 36% (95% CI 18% to 59%), +LR 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7) and −LR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.1). The SN of dyspnoea was 50% (95% CI 19% to 81%) when a cut-off of <92% was used to define hypoxaemia. A modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score >1 (SP 98%, 95% CI 88% to 100%), Roth maximal count <12 (SP 100%, 95% CI 75% to 100%) and Roth counting time <8 s (SP 93%, 95% CI 66% to 100%) had high SP that could be used to rule in hypoxaemia, but displayed low SN (≤50%). Conclusions Subjective dyspnoea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxaemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19. Safe home management of patients with COVID-19 should incorporate home oxygenation saturation monitoring.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73ce677d77c16c9cadb250daa85539b29c2d9f6c

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a critical interface that regulates entry of circulating molecules into the CNS, and is regulated by signals that arise from the brain and blood compartments. In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the BBB may contribute to neurological dysfunction associated with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2. We consider aspects of peripheral disease, such as hypoxia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome/cytokine storm, as well as CNS infection and mechanisms of viral entry into the brain. We also discuss the contribution of risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 to BBB dysfunction that could increase viral entry or otherwise damage the brain.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7f04b1714e214568819d6fcb5193b7f9da3e5dd

A jelenséget "happy hypoxaemia" néven említik. Ugyanakkor a légszomjról nem panaszkodó, de súlyos alveolocapillaris O2-felvételi zavarban szenvedő COVID-19-pneumoniás betegek a legkisebb fizikai megterhelést sem tűrik, és állapotuk gyorsan kritikussá válhat, tehát a hypoxaemia mértékének időben való felismerése kulcskérdés. A jelen közleményben egy ilyen eset rövid ismertetése után összefoglaljuk a súlyos, de tünetmentes hypoxaemia hátterében meghúzódó élettani okokat. Ezek között szerepel a hypocapnia (respiratoricus alkalosis) is, mely alacsony oxigéntenzió mellett is a hemoglobin viszonylag megtartott oxigénszaturációját eredményezi. Ezért a mindennapi COVID-19-ellátásban a megismételt artériásvérgáz-meghatározások jelentősége nem hangsúlyozható eléggé. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 362-365. Summary. Many COVID-19 patients have very low arterial partial oxigen tension while severe dyspnoe does not develop. Pulse oxymetry indicates only moderate reduction of arterial O2 saturation in these patients. The phenomenon is named "happy hypoxaemia". Lack of (severe) dyspnoe and only moderately decreased O2 saturation in severely impaired alveolo-capillary O2 uptake may partially be explained by an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin in the presence of low arterial partial pressure of CO2. The latter results from increased alveolar ventilation, while low partial pressure of O2 in COVID-19 patients reflects right-to-left shunting of pulmonary blood flow and ventilation-perfusion mismatch of the diseased lungs. While such patients may have mild complaints as related to the real impairment of alveolo-capillary oxygen exchange, severe hypoxaemia is a negative prognostic factor of outcome in this state where severe clinical deterioration may rapidly appear. The latter circumstance together with the unusual relationship of O2 partial pressure and O2 saturation of hemoglobin in COVID-19 emphasize the importance of repeated complete arterial blood gas analyses in these patients.

Design Cross-sectional, validation study. Setting Intensive care. Participants Adult patients requiring SaO2-monitoring. Interventions The studied oximeters are top-selling in Europe/USA (AFAC FS10D, AGPTEK FS10C, ANAPULSE ANP 100, Cocobear, Contec CMS50D1, HYLOGY MD-H37, Mommed YM101, PRCMISEMED F4PRO, PULOX PO-200 and Zacurate Pro Series 500 DL). Directly after collection of a SaO2 blood sample, we obtained pulse oximeter readings (SpO2). SpO2-readings were performed in rotating order, blinded for SaO2 and completed <10 min after blood sample collection. Outcome measures Bias (SpO2–SaO2) mean, root mean square difference (ARMS), mean absolute error (MAE) and accuracy in identifying hypoxaemia (SaO2 ≤90%). As a clinical index test, we included a hospital-grade SpO2-monitor (Philips). Results In 35 consecutive patients, we obtained 2258 SpO2-readings and 234 SaO2-samples. Mean bias ranged from −0.6 to −4.8. None of the pulse oximeters met ARMS ≤3%, the requirement set by International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)-standards and required for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 501(k)-clearance. The MAE ranged from 2.3 to 5.1, and five out of ten pulse oximeters met the requirement of ≤3%. For hypoxaemia, negative predictive values were 98%–99%. Positive predictive values ranged from 11% to 30%. Highest accuracy (95% CI) was found for Contec CMS50D1; 91% (86–94) and Zacurate Pro Series 500 DL; 90% (85–94). The hospital-grade SpO2-monitor had an ARMS of 3.0% and MAE of 1.9, and an accuracy of 95% (91%–97%).

We analysed all electronic clinical observations recorded within 28 days of admission until discharge or occurrence of a serious event, defined as any of the following: initiation of respiratory support, admission to intensive care, initiation of end of life care, or in-hospital death., , , RESULTS, 133/296 (44.9%) patients experienced at least one serious event. NEWS2 ≥ 5 heralded the first occurrence of a serious event with sensitivity 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), specificity 0.28 (0.21-0.35), positive predictive value (PPV) 0.53 (0.47-0.59), and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.96 (0.90-1.00). The NPV (but not PPV) of NEWS2 monitoring exceeded that of other early warning scores including the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (0.59 [0.52-0.66], p<0.001) and quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (0.58 [0.51-0.65], p<0.001)., , , CONCLUSION, Our results support the use of NEWS2 monitoring as a sensitive method to identify deterioration of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, albeit at the expense of a relatively high false-trigger rate.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9966694f20229313ae489498c30db8cb709baf98

While enormous strides have been made in understanding the molecular pathways involved in patients infected with coronaviruses an overarching and comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is lacking. Such an understanding is essential in the formulation of effective prophylactic and treatment strategies. Based on clinical, proteomic, and genomic studies as well as autopsy data severe COVID-19 disease can be considered to be the connection of three basic pathologic processes, namely a pulmonary macrophage activation syndrome with uncontrolled inflammation, a complement-mediated endothelialitis together with a procoagulant state with a thrombotic microangiopathy. In addition, platelet activation with the release of serotonin and the activation and degranulation of mast cells contributes to the hyper-inflammatory state. Auto-antibodies have been demonstrated in a large number of hospitalized patients which adds to the end-organ damage and pro-thrombotic state.

This phenomenon, referred to as silent hypoxemia, is not unknown in other settings, but was first described in the context of COVID-19 (1, 2) and occurred in our COVID-19 patient population with increased frequency. Some patients initially present with mild symptoms, but begin to show signs of decompensation after some hours. There is still a lack of systematic studies; the pathophysiology is only partly understood. Consequently, diagnostic interpretation and outpatient care are challenging; the absence of symptom-related distress increases the risk that severe courses of the disease are not recognized. Thus, performing only a brief clinical examination may lead to complications later in the course of the disease.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08f51d04be061370856a7054101d40fb515e771a

Man meeting although it.;DemoPaper;Alterations in brain functioning, especially in regions associated with cognition, can result from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and are predicted to result in various psychiatric diseases. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, diseases associated with sequelae of COVID-19, or ‘long COVID’, also include serious long-term mental and cognitive changes, including the condition recently termed ‘brain fog’. Hypoxia in the microenvironment of select brain areas may benefit the reproductive capacity of the virus. It is possible that in areas of cerebral hypoxia, neuronal cell energy metabolism may become compromised after integration of the viral genome, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Because of their need for constant high metabolism, cerebral tissues require an immediate and constant supply of oxygen. In hypoxic conditions, neurons with the highest oxygen demand become dysfunctional. The resulting cognitive impairment benefits viral spread, as infected individuals exhibit behaviors that reduce protection against infection. The effects of compromised mitochondrial function may also be an evolutionary advantage for SARS-CoV-2 in terms of host interaction. A high viral load in patients with COVID-19 that involves the CNS results in the compromise of neurons with high-level energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose that selective neuronal mitochondrial targeting in SARS-CoV-2 infection affects cognitive processes to induce ‘brain fog’ and results in behavioral changes that favor viral propagation. Cognitive changes associated with COVID-19 will have increasing significance for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and long-term care.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4683088f9c8c016e2aecb9184156d3240c54c222

We ascertained the time course of intradialytic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) in MHD patients between 4 weeks pre-diagnosis and the week post-diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods We conducted a quality improvement project in confirmed COVID-19 in-center MHD patients from 11 dialysis facilities. In patients with an arterio-venous access, SaO2 was measured 1×/min during dialysis using the Crit-Line monitor (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA, USA). We extracted demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data, and COVID-19-related symptoms from the patients’ electronic health records. Results Intradialytic SaO2 was available in 52 patients (29 males; mean ± standard deviation age 66.5 ± 15.7 years) contributing 338 HD treatments. Mean time between onset of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 and diagnosis was 1.1 days (median 0; range 0–9). Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis the rate of HD treatments with hypoxemia, defined as treatment-level average SaO2 <90%, increased from 2.8% (2–4 weeks pre-diagnosis) to 12.2% (1 week) and 20.7% (3 days pre-diagnosis). Intradialytic O2 supplementation increased sharply post-diagnosis. Eleven patients died from COVID-19 within 5 weeks. Compared with patients who recovered from COVID-19, demised patients showed a more pronounced decline in SaO2 prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions In HD patients, hypoxemia may precede the onset of clinical symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19. A steep decline of SaO2 is associated with poor patient outcomes.

Help evening audience also investment across.;Poster;Background Invasive mechanical ventilation of hypoxaemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is associated with mortality rates of >50%. We evaluated clinical outcome data of two hospitals that agreed on a predefined protocol for restrictive use of invasive ventilation where the decision to intubate was based on the clinical presentation and oxygen content rather than on the degree of hypoxaemia. Method Data analysis was carried out of patients with positive PCR-testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), typical history, and symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates who exhibited oxygen saturation values of <93%. Results We identified 78 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The oxygen saturation nadir was 84.4±6.5% for the whole group. 53 patients (68%) received nasal oxygen (group 1), 17 patients (22%) were treated with nasal high-flow continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation or a combination thereof (group 2), and eight patients (10%) were intubated (group 3). The Horovitz index was 216±8 for group 1, 157±13 for group 2 and 106±15 for group 3. Oxygen content was 14.5±2.5, 13.4±1.9 and 11.6±2.6 mL O2·dL−1 for the three respective groups. Overall mortality was 7.7%; the mortality of intubated patients was 50%. Overall, 93% of patients could be discharged on room air. Conclusion Permissive hypoxaemia where decisions for the level of respiratory therapy were based on the clinical presentation and oxygen content resulted in low intubation rates, low overall mortality and a low number of patients who require oxygen after discharge.

Thanks to early flattening of the epidemiological curve, ventilator demand in Greece was kept lower than supply throughout the pandemic, allowing for unbiased comparison of the outcomes of patients undergoing early intubation vs. delayed or no intubation. Methods: We conducted an observational study including all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 consecutively admitted in Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020. Patients subsequently admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into the “early intubation” vs. the “delayed or no intubation” group. The “delayed or no intubation” group included patients receiving non-rebreather mask for equal to or more than 24 h or high-flow nasal oxygen for any period of time or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for any period of time in an attempt to avoid intubation. The remaining intubated patients comprised the “early intubation” group. Results: During the study period, a total of 101 patients (37% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the hospital. Fifty-nine patients (58% of the entire cohort) were exclusively hospitalized in general wards with a mortality of 3% and median length of stay of 7 days. Forty-two patients (19% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the ICU; all with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Of those admitted in the ICU, 62% had at least one comorbidity and 14% were never intubated. Early intubation was not associated with higher ICU-mortality (21 vs. 33%), fewer ventilator-free days (3 vs. 2 days) or fewer ICU-free days than delayed or no intubation. Conclusions: A strategy of early intubation was not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to delayed or no intubation. Given that early intubation may presumably reduce virus aerosolization, these results may justify further research with a randomized controlled trial.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5741891d83bedd3f811c3940e7617fe22627dc13

Since severely ill patients often show elevated methemoglobin (MetHb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentrations in their blood as a marker of disease severity, we aimed to summarize the currently available published study results (case reports and cross-sectional studies) on MetHb and COHb concentrations in the blood of COVID-19 patients. To this end, a systematic literature research was performed. For the case of MetHb, seven publications were identified (five case reports and two cross-sectional studies), and for the case of COHb, three studies were found (two cross-sectional studies and one case report). The findings reported in the publications show that an increase in MetHb and COHb can happen in COVID-19 patients, especially in critically ill ones, and that MetHb and COHb can increase to dangerously high levels during the course of the disease in some patients. The medications given to the patient and the patient’s glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status seem to be important factors determining the severity of the methemoglobinemia and carboxyhemoglobinemia. Therefore, G6PD status should be determined before medications such as hydroxychloroquine are administered. In conclusion, MetHb and COHb can be elevated in COVID-19 patients and should be checked routinely in order to provide adequate medical treatment as well as to avoid misinterpretation of fingertip pulse oximetry readings, which can be inaccurate and unreliable in case of elevated MetHb and COHb levels in the blood.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de5572c78cee1a655ce5d2e0b9adf50d955e67d4

Recognizing hypoxia in patients early on can have a considerable effect on therapy success and survival rate. Methods We collected data using a standard blood gas analyzer from 50 patients and analyzed measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxide-pCO2, partial pressure of oxygen-pO2 and oxygen saturation-sO2, bicarbonate concentrations-HCO3− as well as ionized calcium concentrations. We further examined PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 of the patients and analyzed differences between patients tested positive and those tested negative for the virus. Results Venous pCO2 was significantly higher whereas pO2 and sO2 were significantly lower in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The pH, and ionized calcium concentrations of patients tested positive for the virus were significantly lower than in those tested negative. Conclusions Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients upon admission to the emergency room exhibit lower venous blood levels of oxygen, pH, and calcium and higher levels of carbon dioxide compared to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. This blood gas analysis constellation could help in identifying SARS-CoV-2-positive patients more rapidly and identifying early signs of hypoxia.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/756e1bc5da7b6bfc44de1a5d1a58ce6e993d7795

As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 μM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction. Methylene blue inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells with similar IC50 (3.5 μM). Hence, this PPI inhibitory activity could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe63a6ae45ebba918bd843898917fa9f7bb07f9d

We aim to describe the acute functional outcomes of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients after transferring out of the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: 51 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients at a national designated center for COVID-19 were included in this exploratory, retrospective observational cohort study from January 1 to May 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed. Functional outcomes were measured primarily with the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and divided into 2 categories: dependent ambulators (FAC 0–3) and independent ambulators (FAC 4–5). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine associations. Results: Many patients were dependent ambulators (47.1%) upon transferring out of ICU, although 92.2% regained independent ambulation at discharge. On multivariate analysis, we found that a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1 or more (odds ratio 14.02, 95% CI 1.15–171.28, P = 0.039) and a longer length of ICU stay (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.04–2.16, P = 0.029) were associated with dependent ambulation upon discharge from ICU. Conclusions: Critically ill COVID-19 survivors have a high level of impairment following discharge from ICU. Such patients should be screened for impairment and managed appropriately by rehabilitation professionals, so as to achieve good functional outcomes on discharge.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8596d566b2075d7fb6e1a27547a1895bd1d621b0

Since the dominant respiratory feature of COVID-19 is worsening arterial hypoxemia, eventually leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) promptly needing mechanical ventilation, a systematic recourse to intubation of every hypoxemic patient may be difficult to sustain in such peculiar context and may not be deemed appropriate for all patients. Then, it is essential that caregivers have a solid knowledge of physiological principles to properly interpret arterial oxygenation, to intubate at the satisfactory moment, to adequately manage mechanical ventilation, and, finally, to initiate ventilator weaning, as safely and as expeditiously as possible, in order to make it available for the next patient. Through the expected mechanisms of COVID-19-induced hypoxemia, as well as the notion of silent hypoxemia often evoked in COVID-19 lung injury and its potential parallelism with high altitude pulmonary edema, from the description of hemoglobin oxygen affinity in patients with severe COVID-19 to the interest of the prone positioning in order to treat severe ARDS patients, this review aims to help caregivers from any specialty to handle respiratory support following recent knowledge in the pathophysiology of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a7ea0910a8b79e809ce7f5da512e4664954fc5

Initially, improved supportive and anti-inflammatory intervention, often employing known drugs or technologies, provided measurable improvement in management. We have recently seen advances in specific therapeutic interventions and in vaccines. Nevertheless, it will be months before most of the world's population can be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. In the interim, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment offers several potentially beneficial therapeutic effects. Three small published series, one with a propensity-score-matched control group, have demonstrated safety and initial efficacy. Additional anecdotal reports are consistent with these publications. HBO2 delivers oxygen in extreme conditions of hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia, even in the presence of lung pathology. It provides anti-inflammatory and anti-proinflammatory effects likely to ameliorate the overexuberant immune response common to COVID-19. Unlike steroids, it exerts these effects without immune suppression. One study suggests HBO2 may reduce the hypercoagulability seen in COVID patients. Also, hyperbaric oxygen offers a likely successful intervention to address the oxygen debt expected to arise from a prolonged period of hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. To date, 11 studies designed to investigate the impact of HBO2 on patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 have been posted on clinicaltrials.gov.

A growing number of studies have found that the severe COVID-19 patients have thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolism. Coagulopathy associated with increased risk of death in the patients. Unfortunately, the mechanism of coagulopathy is not clearly addressed. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 thrombosis and improving the coagulopathy through efficient treatment may help to stop disease progression, reduce mortality and sequelae. In severe COVID-19 patients, inflammation, cytokine storm, and coagulation are closely related, which together cause blood congestion and thrombosis. Many cytokines activate blood cells, expressing activating factors or releasing activated microparticles, and then accelerating thrombosis. However, the role of blood cells is not well understood in COVID-19 patients. In addition, cytokines stimulate endothelial cells, transforming them into a procoagulant phenotype. Therefore, determine their role and propose new strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in severe COVID-19 patients.

Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well‐conducted human trials. Newer information with anti‐TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID‐19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti‐TNF biologicals on community‐acquired COVID‐19 during their long‐term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL‐7Rα, the receptor for IL‐7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody‐based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL‐7‐ enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti‐TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL‐7, currently being trialed as a COVID‐19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID‐19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4‐positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553e6fa5f4a7adaa15a5049cdc2bbf98483685fa

However, pulse oximetry has impaired accuracy in certain patient groups, and data are lacking on its accuracy in patients with COVID-19 stepping down from intensive care unit (ICU) to non-ICU settings or being transferred to another ICU. Methods We assessed the bias, precision and limits of agreement using 90 paired SpO2 and SaO2 from 30 patients (3 paired samples per patient). To assess the agreement between pulse oximetry (SpO2) and arterial blood gas analysis (SaO2) in patients with COVID-19, deemed clinically stable to step down from an ICU to a non-ICU ward, or be transferred to another ICU. This was done to evaluate whether the guidelines were appropriate for our setting. Results Mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 (bias) was 0.4%, with an SD of 2.4 (precision). The limits of agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 were as follows: upper limit of 5.2% (95% CI 6.5% to 4.2%) and lower limit of −4.3% (95% CI −3.4% to −5.7%). Conclusions In our setting, pulse oximetry showed a level of agreement with SaO2 measurement that was slightly suboptimal, although within acceptable levels for Food and Drug Authority approval, in people with COVID-19 judged clinically ready to step down from ICU to a non-ICU ward, or who were being transferred to another hospital’s ICU. In such patients, SpO2 should be interpreted with caution.

Effective therapies are still awaited due to the lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Bearing recent research and clinical observations in mind, the authors propose a novel physiological mechanism of COVID-19 and explain development of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 related hemoglobinopathy. It is a consistent observation that the radiological picture of COVID-19 related ARDS bears more resemblance to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) than typical ARDS. There has been great controversy regarding this proposed similarity. The main argument from those objecting to this comparison is that the etiology is hypoxia in case of HAPE and inflammation in COVID-19 related ARDS. We propose that considering the recent bioinformatics prediction models, COVID-19 might first infect red blood cells via CD147 and cause hemoglobin damage. The resulting hypoxemia may cause pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction leading to HAPE-like lung lesions. The now introduced alveolar hypoxia further exaggerates hemoglobinopathy hypoxemia leading to a vicious cycle. In this review, the authors recommend laboratory experiments to prove these hypotheses. The proposed physiological mechanism has significant therapeutic implications. If proven, the authors suggest the use of exchange transfusion as adjunct therapy and development of anti-CD147 drugs.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcc3c6e3bce36ea62a3fb7e899c34c8fc3796de5

We aimed to identify differences in patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of COVID-19 positive cases to develop and validate a diagnostic-model predicting who will develop severe-form and who will need critical-care in the future. Methods: In this observational retrospective study, COVID-19 positive cases (total 417) diagnosed in Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE were recruited, and their prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital and the need for intensive care was reviewed until their tests turned negative. Patients were classified according to their clinical state into mild, moderate, severe, and critical. We retrieved all the baseline clinical data, laboratory, and radiological results and used them to identify parameters that can predict admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Patients with ICU admission showed a distinct clinical, demographic as well as laboratory features when compared to patients who did not need ICU admission. This includes the elder age group, male gender, and presence of comorbidities like diabetes and history of hypertension. ROC and Precision-Recall curves showed that among all variables, D dimers (>1.5 mg/dl), Urea (>6.5 mmol/L), and Troponin (>13.5 ng/ml) could positively predict the admission to ICU in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, decreased Lymphocyte count and albumin can predict admission to ICU in patients with COVID-19 with acceptable sensitivity (59.32, 95% CI [49.89–68.27]) and specificity (79.31, 95% CI [72.53–85.07]). Conclusion: Using these three predictors with their cut of values can identify patients who are at risk of developing critical COVID-19 and might need aggressive intervention earlier in the course of the disease.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2856a4beebda74278a01ceae461057476b7988a

Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) has been recently suggested as a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19. Methods: This was an observational study enrolling patients between February 26 and May 15 2020. We aimed to validate the association of the previously published RDW threshold of 14.5% with markers of disease progression and mortality. Results: A total number of 193 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled and analyzed. Median age was 61 years (95% CI: 58–64). Patients with baseline RDW ≥14.5% (n = 41, 19.2%) presented with more progressive disease compared to patients with baseline RDW <14.5% (n = 156, 80.8%) as indicated by significant differences in maximum FiO2% during hospitalization (median: 100, 95% CI: 45.2–100, vs. 35, 95% CI: 31–40, p = 0.0001, respectively). Values of RDW ≥14.5% were also strongly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 4.1, 95% CI: 0.88–19.23), (p = 0.02).

At experience reduce story author.;DemoPaper;Background COVID-19 is characterized by a rapid change in the patients condition, with major changes occurring over a few days. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. Methodology/Principal findings The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patients condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW environment that is able to provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO 2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO 2 <92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidences that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9fb1f2279bfd3460b673e546f9a9b1aacd2f421

Compare factor early blue.;DemoPaper;In December 2019, COVID-19, a severe respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies’ recommended “supportive care only” avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of “what was working and what wasn’t working,” the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically. The review concludes with a comparison of published multi-national mortality data with MATH+ center outcomes.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7bbc3d537e3118541f8f51bcc448617abc15f4f8

Lead heart hot people do day.;FullPaper;Shortly after the onset of the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), concerns were raised about the potentially heightened risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).1 To substantiate these suspicions, we performed a questionnaire-based study to assess the severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering PD andmultiple sclerosis (MS), whose SARSCoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. We found that none of them (PD, n= 5;MS, n= 10) developed severe clinical manifestations of infectious disease. Importantly, all patients were taking amantadine.2 Although the aforementioned lack of severe cases among patients taking amantadine could happen by chance, it also provoked hypothesis generation. We suggested that our finding may reflect possible effect of amantadine antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2. Indeed, it has recently been shown that amantadine interferes with the lysosomal milieu andmay inhibit the virus’s entry to host cells.3 However, currently amantadine is the foremost neurological drug, used to treat PD and disorders of consciousness and prescribed off-label to patients suffering from MS. The drug enters the blood-brain barrier and acts as a weak but unique glutamate/N-methyl-Daspartate receptor antagonist, which concomitantly activates the cystine/glutamate antiporter and stimulates glutathione synthesis.4 We would like to point to 2 other possible mechanisms by which this drug could contribute to mitigation of COVID-19 in infected patients. The first relates to the anti-fatigue effect. Fatigue, a very prevalent symptom in MS (>90% patients), is a multifaceted phenomenon partially related to central mechanisms. Already >3 decades ago a serendipitous observation was made that a patient with MS had a remarkable improvement in fatigue while taking amantadine to prevent influenza, and the effect was soon confirmed in a small double-blind controlled study. Amantadine is the only drug that seemed to improve fatigue symptoms in MS, although the data were limited,5 and a more recent study did not support such conclusion.6 Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19 in adults and is more common in patients who require hospitalization. A recent report evidenced that COVID-19 increased fatigue in a cohort of patients with PD.7 Importantly, patients with MS and PD display blunted respiratory response to hypercapina and hypoxia.8,9 A connection of depressed responsivity to carbon dioxide and hypoxia with fatigue appears intuitively highly probable. The second mechanism by which amantadine may benefit patients with COVID-19 relates to its arousalenhancing effect. Impaired consciousness is a frequent central nervous system manifestation of COVID-19. Since arousal is a normal, physiological response to respiratory stimuli such as hypoxia and hypercapnia, it is plausible to expect that impaired consciousness in patients with COVID-19 blunt their respiratory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Depressed response to hypercapnia and hypoxia may be an important factor in the development of severe forms of COVID-19, including the so-called silent, or “happy” hypoxemia, a phenomenon of the absence of dyspnea in patients with COVID-19 who exhibit severe hypoxemia with considerable risk of death.10 Although it is too early to advocate amantadine as a treatment for COVID-19, a controlled trial of this drug for postexposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV2 infection is indicated.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e9a379b55bfb2d29c354c423780e4050b8a16f0

There are worldwide descriptions of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease. As many as 55% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been reported to have neurological disturbances three months after infection by SARS-CoV-2. The mutability of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its potential to directly affect the CNS highlight the urgency of developing technology to diagnose, manage, and treat brain injury in COVID-19 patients. The pathobiology of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated neurological sequelae of this infection remain poorly understood. In this review, we outline the rationale for the use of blood biomarkers (BBs) for diagnosis of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, the research needed to incorporate their use into clinical practice, and the improvements in patient management and outcomes that can result. BBs of brain injury could potentially provide tools for detection of brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Elevations of BBs have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of COVID-19 patients. BB proteins have been analyzed in CSF to detect CNS involvement in patients with infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculous meningitis. BBs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnosis of mild versus moderate traumatic brain injury and have identified brain injury after stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and epilepsy. BBs, integrated with other diagnostic tools, could enhance understanding of viral mechanisms of brain injury, predict severity of neurological deficits, guide triage of patients and assignment to appropriate medical pathways, and assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4187d53f261a39c34b90e59ebfa5374d4d032c6a

The manifestations, which are due to hypopigmentation, are confined to the eyes and optic pathway. OA1 associated with late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss was previously reported in a single family and hypothesized to be caused by a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving GPR143 and the adjacent gene, TBL1X. Here, we report on a family with OA1, infertility, late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss, and a small interstitial Xp microdeletion including the GPR143, TBL1X, and SHROOM2 genes. In addition, we re‐examined a patient previously described with OA1, infertility and a similar Xp deletion with audiologic follow‐up showing a late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss. Our results raise an intriguing question about the possibility for TBL1X (absence) involvement in this type of hearing loss. However, our study cannot claim a causative relationship and more convincing evidence is needed before the hypothesis can be accepted that TBL1X could be involved in late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss and that ocular albinism with late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss can present itself as a contiguous gene deletion/microdeletion syndrome. The finding of infertility in all affected male patients demonstrates that this deletion, including the SHROOM2 gene, may be a potentially causative X‐linked genetic factor of male infertility.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42827aff36ca001dea5ebee1058d116498f8dbb5

Once transmitted, the virus affects the lungs and in predisposed individuals can elicit a sequela of fatal cardiovascular consequences. We aim to present the pathophysiology of COVID-19, emphasizing the major cellular and clinical manifestations from a cardiological perspective. As a roaming viral particle or more likely via the Trojan horse route, SARS-CoV-2 can access different parts of the body. Cardiovascular features of COVID-19 can count myocardial injuries, vasculitis-like syndromes, and atherothrombotic manifestations. Deviations in the normal electrocardiogram pattern could hide pericardial effusion or cardiac inflammation, and dispersed microthrombi can cause ischemic damages, stroke, or even medullary reflex dysfunctions. Tailored treatment for reduced ejection fraction, arrhythmias, coronary syndromes, macrothrombosis and microthrombosis, and autonomic dysfunctions is mandatory. Confidently, evidence-based therapies for this multifaceted nevertheless purely cardiological COVID-19 will emerge after the global assessment of different approaches.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d853c65712470a3e582c63404f6833a871ce1abc

These cells are also essential for O2 homeostasis. Glomus cells are prototypical peripheral O2 sensors necessary to detect hypoxemia and to elicit rapid compensatory responses (hyperventilation and sympathetic activation). The mechanisms underlying acute O2 sensing by glomus cells have been elusive. Using a combination of mouse genetics and single-cell optical and electrophysiological techniques, it has recently been shown that activation of glomus cells by hypoxia relies on the generation of mitochondrial signals (NADH and reactive oxygen species), which modulate membrane ion channels to induce depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and transmitter release. The special sensitivity of glomus cell mitochondria to changes in O2 tension is due to Hif2α-dependent expression of several atypical mitochondrial subunits, which are responsible for an accelerated oxidative metabolism and the strict dependence of mitochondrial complex IV activity on O2 availability. A mitochondrial-to-membrane signaling model of acute O2 sensing has been proposed, which explains existing data and provides a solid foundation for future experimental tests. This model has also unraveled new molecular targets for pharmacological modulation of carotid body activity potentially relevant in the treatment of highly prevalent medical conditions.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/268f7e42814ca8dc7a4861b345c84c2e4b6c9f49

Toward fact election evidence clearly.;DemoPaper;AIM, To analyse the association of sleep quality with myopia under different genetic risk (GR) levels., , , METHODS, A cross-sectional survey of students aged 9-14y in Wenzhou, China, was conducted. Refraction without cycloplegia and ocular parameters were measured. Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were replicated by association analysis and used to compute the GR score (GRS). Possible confounders were assessed by a questionnaire that collected information about the children and their parents. Generalized linear models were used to analyse the sleep quality, the GR, and their interaction effects on the risk of myopia., , , RESULTS, Out of 1354 children included in this study, 353 (26.07%) had sleep disturbances. The GRS ranged from 4.49 to 12.89 with a mean of 7.74±1.23, and the participants were divided into a low GR group, a moderate GR group and a high GR group according to the GRS quartile. In the generalized linear model, the children with sleep disturbances and high GR had a higher risk of myopia than those without sleep disturbances and with low GR (OR=1.59, 95%CI: 1.12-2.25; OR=1.88, 95%CI: 1.23-2.88, respectively). Compared to those with low GR and SDs, children with high GR with or without SDs had a higher risk of myopia (OR=4.88, 95%CI: 2.03-11.71; OR=1.70, 95%CI: 1.06-2.72, respectively)., , , CONCLUSION, The prevalence of sleep disturbances in elementary school students in Wenzhou was 26.07%. There is a significant interaction between sleep disturbances and a high GR of myopia, suggesting that a high GR of myopia may increase children's sensitivity to sleep disturbances. This study indicates that children with a high GR of myopia need to achieve adequate sleep duration and excellent sleep quality.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a26f4298fe1bf32515aaa487818d1278e12d367

Methods The study was a non-randomised experimenter-masked prospective controlled observational study of individuals aged 6–18 years with progressing myopia but no ocular pathology. Participants were allocated, according to patient/parent choice, to receive 0.01% atropine eyedrops, DIMS (Hoya® MiyoSmart®) spectacles, combined atropine+DIMS or single vision spectacle lenses (control group). The key outcome variables, cycloplegic autorefraction spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and axial length (AL), were measured at baseline and after three, six, and 12 months. Results Of the 146 participants (mean age 10.3y ±3.2), 53 received atropine, 30 DIMS spectacles, 31 atropine+DIMS, and 32 single vision control spectacles. Generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed for SER, whilst controlling for age and SER at baseline, at each stage all treatment groups had significantly reduced progression compared with the control group (p<0.016). For AL, whilst controlling for baseline age and AL, at 6 and 12 months all treatment groups had significantly less progression than the control group (p<0.005). For SER only, in pairwise comparisons at 12 months the atropine+DIMS group had significantly reduced progression compared with the DIMS only and Atropine only groups (p<0.001). Conclusion In a European population, DIMS and atropine are effective at reducing myopia progression and axial elongation in progressing myopia and are most successful at reducing myopia progression when used in combination.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a67bce031cab4116ff22315ce294b1a030fc4537

This study aims to utilize geovisualization-based methods to assess attitudes towards different levels of alcohol exposure in the urban environment. We selected a typical downtown location, Lavapiés Square in Madrid, Spain, to conduct our study. First, we designed and created realistic 3D models simulating three different urban scenes with varying degrees of exposure to alcohol in the environment. Second, we used a survey on 159 adults to explore the level of acceptance of, attitudes towards, and perceptions of alcohol exposure in each scene. Participants reported a higher level of comfort in the scene with null alcohol exposure compared with the other scenes (p < 0.001). Acceptance towards alcohol exposure decreased as the level of alcohol elements increased in the scenes (p < 0.01). Acceptance also decreased when children were present in the scenes (p < 0.01). This study demonstrated that geovisualization tools provide a useful and well-suited approach to analyze perceptions of the alcohol environment. The use of geovisualization can help understand attitudes and perceptions towards the alcohol environment and may offer a way to simulate different scenarios prior to development or retrofitting.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bba5afb44b4d6473ce50c55a0f857ac5efc7f64

The aim of this study was to detect the factors affecting verbal and psychological violence against women in Turkey, a developing country. The micro data set of the National research on domestic violence against women in Turkey, which was conducted by the Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies, was employed in this study. The factors affecting women’s exposure to verbal and psychological violence by their husbands or partners in Turkey were determined using binary logistic and binary probit regression analyses. Women whose husbands or partners cheated and used alcohol were more exposed to verbal and psychological violence compared to others. In addition, women who were exposed to physical, economic, and sexual violence were more exposed to verbal and psychological violence compared to others. Exposure to violence by first-degree relatives increases the possibility of exposure to verbal and psychological violence. More effective results can be achieved by prioritizing women likelier to be exposed to violence in policies aimed at preventing acts of verbal violence against women in our country. There are few studies on verbal and psychological violence against women. Therefore, it will be useful to conduct relevant studies from different perspectives.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d8a2645613df26dcdb66ca2fa9924868e346605

This study aimed to identify the factors that affect older individuals' access to psychological assistance services in Turkey. Methods In this study, the Turkish Health Research micro dataset, which was conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) in 2016 and 2019, was employed. In this dataset, the data of 7,252 older individuals were analyzed. Using binary logistic analysis, the factors that are effective for obtaining psychological assistance for the older individuals were identified. Results According to the results of the analysis, factors such as gender, education, general health status, disease status, payment of health expenditures, and body mass index affected older individuals who received psychological assistance. Conclusion In recent years, there has been a rise in the availability of psychological assistance services for the older individuals. By identifying factors that increase the likelihood of receiving psychological assistance services, this study is expected to contribute to the creation and regulation of psychological assistance services to prevent possible psychological problems that may occur in old age, minimize the problems experienced by individuals, and promote a more comfortable lifestyle.;Yes;No;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65ea4f5491b90f87d48f267c7ed4e7ddbf17e529

Production turn now wrong reason.;FullPaper;The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has created a worldwide pandemic. Many patients with this infection have an asymptomatic or mild illness, but a small percentage of patients require hospitalization and intensive care. Patients with respiratory tract involvement have a spectrum of presentations that range from scattered ground-glass infiltrates to diffuse infiltrates with consolidation. Patients with the latter radiographic presentation have severe hypoxemia and usually require mechanical ventilation. In addition, some patients develop multiorgan failure, deep venous thrombi with pulmonary emboli, and cytokine storm syndrome. The respiratory management of these patients should focus on using low tidal volume ventilation with low intrathoracic pressures. Some patients have significant recruitable lung and may benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and/or prone positioning. There is no well-established anti-viral treatment for this infection; the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma and remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In addition, randomized trials have demonstrated that dexamethasone improves outcomes in patients on mechanical ventilators or on oxygen. There are ongoing trials of other drugs which have the potential to moderate the acute inflammatory state seen in some of these patients. These patients often need prolonged high-level intensive care. Hospitals are confronted with significant challenges in patient management, supply management, health care worker safety, and health care worker burnout.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03ac4dc7d0478a77e565564fb7da8785fb6a92ce

Design Secondary data analysis. Participants Altogether, 17 084 individuals aged 15 and over were included in this study. Settings Data set of the Turkey Health Survey in 2019. Methods Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with individuals’ exposure to tobacco smoke. Primary and secondary outcome measures The variables age, gender, marital status, general health status, employment status, receipt of psychosocial support and tobacco use were found to be correlated with exposure to tobacco smoke. Results The study determined that individuals who are illiterate/unschooled were exposed to tobacco smoke at a rate of 32.61%, primary school graduates at a rate of 34.32%, primary education graduates at a rate of 41.75%, high school graduates at a rate of 41.04% and university graduates at a rate of 40.34%. Conclusion As a result of the study, it is emphasised that men, young individuals, individuals with moderate and very good general health status, those who use tobacco, those who are unemployed and those who receive psychosocial support should be targeted. In addition, appropriate strategies for reducing secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure should be developed, taking into account public health strategies for increasing awareness of the adverse health effects of SHS exposure and the determinants of tobacco exposure according to the study.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9965ad0a0ab38e5cb55750c21b4c21595d3861f

Patients with COVID-19 present mainly with respiratory symptoms. Prone position has been traditionally used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to improve oxygenation and prevent barotrauma in ventilated patients. Awake proning is being used as an investigational therapy in COVID to defer invasive ventilation, improve oxygenation, and outcomes. Hence, we conducted a retrospective case study to look for benefits of awake proning with oxygen therapy in non-intubated COVID patients. Materials and methods A retrospective case study of 15 COVID patients admitted from June 15 to July 1, 2020 to HDU in our hospital was conducted. Cooperative patients who were hemodynamically stable and SpO2 < 90% on presentation were included. Oxygen was administered through facemask, non-rebreathing mask and noninvasive ventilation to patients as per requirement. Patients were encouraged to maintain prone position and target time was 10–12 hours/day. SpO2 and P/f ratio in supine and prone position was observed till discharge. Primary target was SpO2 > 95% and P/f > 200 mm Hg. Other COVID therapies were used according to institutional protocol. Results The mean SpO2 on room air on admission was 80%. In day 1 to 3, the mean P/f ratio in supine position was 98.8 ± 29.7 mm Hg which improved to 136.6 ± 38.8 mm Hg after proning (p = 0.005). The difference was significant from day 1 to 10. Two patients were intubated. The mean duration of stay was 11 days. Conclusion Awake prone positioning showed marked improvement in P/f ratio and SpO2 in COVID-19 patients with improvement in clinical symptoms with reduced rate of intubation. Highlights Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation by reducing V/Q mismatch. Awake prone positioning has been used along with high-flow oxygen therapy in recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus for management of mild to moderate cases.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases (with manual searching of reference lists of reviews). Studies included assessed changes in myopia-related outcomes (cycloplegic refraction) during COVID and pre-COVID. Of 367 articles identified, 7 (6 prospective cohorts; 1 repeated cross-sectional study) comprising 6327 participants aged 6 to 17 were included. Quality appraisals were performed with Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists. Pooled differences in annualized myopic shifts or mean spherical equivalent (SE) during COVID and pre-COVID were obtained from random-effects models. Results: In all 7 studies, SE moved toward a myopic direction during COVID (vs pre-COVID), where 5 reported significantly faster myopic shifts [difference in means of changes: −1.20 to −0.35 diopters per year, [D/y]; pooled estimate: −0.73 D/y; 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.96, −0.50; P<0.001], and 2 reported significantly more myopic SE (difference in means: −0.72 to −0.44 D/y; pooled estimate: −0.54 D/y; 95% CI: −0.80, −0.28; P<0.001). Three studies reported higher myopia (SE ≤−0.50 D) incidence (2.0- to 2.6-fold increase) during COVID versus pre-COVID. Of studies assessing lifestyle changes, all 4 reported lower time outdoors (pre-COVID vs during COVID: 1.1–1.8 vs 0.4–1.0 hours per day, [h/d]), and 3 reported higher screen time (pre-COVID vs during COVID: 0.7–2.8 vs 2.4–6.9 h/d). Conclusions: This review suggests more myopic SE shifts during COVID (vs pre-COVID) in participants aged 6 to 17. COVID-19 restrictions may have worsened SE shifts, and lifting of restrictions may lessen this effect. Evaluations of the long-term effects of the pandemic lifestyle on myopia onset and progression in large studies are warranted to confirm these findings.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20edce6a80e24ea2cfd312f4b5bfa29210acdfd0

In this study, urban environmental pollution was evaluated for the first time using a new developed index. The findings indicated that cigarette butts with an average 58% are the largest share in the composition of littered waste. In addition, the numbers of littered wastes throughout the study area had a spatial variation. According to clean environment index (CEI), the entire study area was found to be in a moderate status. However, 40% of the study areas were classified in a dirty and extremely dirty status. Comparison of the studied urban land-uses showed that residential land use with CEI equal to 3.38 is interpreted in the clean status, while commercial land use with CEI equal to 15.05 can be classified in the dirty status. The application of CEI has a good capability to assess littered waste; this index can be employed to evaluate the pollution of urban sidewalks and other environments such as beaches.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe82f978d8cc28fe7d247ad4bd1844006cc58525

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), combined with physical simulators, represent a valid tool to overcome this issue. In this work, we investigate algorithmic solutions to improve the Quality Diversity of co-evolved designs of Tensegrity Soft Modular Robots (TSMRs) for two robotic tasks, namely goal reaching and squeezing trough a narrow passage. To this aim, we use three different EAs, i.e., MAP-Elites and two custom algorithms: one based on Viability Evolution (ViE) and NEAT (ViE-NEAT), the other named Double Map MAP-Elites (DM-ME) and devised to seek diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when considering diversity in terms of "illumination" of the feature space, DM-ME outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f62d4c9b3abccb4c91886b64ffcf6203fee0074

Tree assume appear someone your relationship.;DemoPaper;Quality-Diversity algorithms search for large collections of diverse and high-performing solutions, rather than just for a single solution like typical optimisation methods. They are specially adapted for multi-modal problems that can be solved in many different ways, such as complex reinforcement learning or robotics tasks. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the choice of feature descriptors (FDs) quantifying the similarity in behaviour of the solutions. While FDs usually needs to be hand-designed, recent studies have proposed ways to define them automatically by using feature extraction techniques, such as PCA or Auto-Encoders, to learn a representation of the problem from previously explored solutions. Here, we extend these approaches to more complex problems which cannot be efficiently explored by relying only on a single representation but require instead a set of diverse and complementary representations. We describe MC-AURORA, a Quality-Diversity approach that optimises simultaneously several collections of solutions, each with a different set of FDs, which are, in turn, defined automatically by an ensemble of modular auto-encoders. We show that this approach produces solutions that are more diverse than those produced by single-representation approaches.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4a8e06b213f32e6a1350c3fbf1ece8aca924a14

Wind field through watch., Measure control full two suggest wall. Democrat second can issue leave thus every mission.;ShortPaper;Evolution in nature has allowed biological systems to develop and survive in many different environments. It can be attributed to one of the major features of natural evolution: its open-endedness, that can be considered as the ability to continuously produce novelty and/or complexity [1]. This feature is critical to allow an agent to continuously adapt to its environment. We propose here an extension of Quality Diversity algorithms to make it more open-ended. Quality Diversity algorithms aim at generating a large set of diverse solutions [3, 10]. They can be used in a two-steps process in which (1) a diverse set of solutions is generated offline before (2) the agent can exploit it online to find the behavior that fits to the situation [2, 4--6]. QD algorithms main goal is to fill a behavior space whose dimensions are defined by behavior descriptors. Current QD algorithms can generate novelty and complexity, but within the frame of these behavior descriptors. To make the evolutionary process more open-ended, we extend Cully and Demiris framework [3] and introduce Multi-Container Quality Diversity algorithms (MCQD). MCQD are QD algorithms relying on multiple behavior spaces that can be added on the fly. MCQD thus aims at implementing an open-ended evolutionary process that would explore any new behavior space that could be found of interest during the search process.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62e6dbefef41f7ba77246a563948c44e22be5891

Broken windows theory posits that visible signs of anti-social behavior such as littering create the perception of a social norm in built environments. Cigarette butts on the ground then encourage people to drop theirs as well. We test this theory on benches of a university campus in a field experiment with two treatments: (1) a clean environment with no cigarette butts on the ground and (2) a dirty environment with 25 cigarette butts on the ground. Our outcome variable is the number of additional cigarette butts on the ground after two hours. We find a small effect of approximately 0.5 butts less per 2-hour period on clean grounds. Increased cleaning efforts can thus reduce littering, but the effect is probably too small to justify additional cleaning costs.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b8c7fe67d9f6f5939100ac57f633a60bac5fed4b

To introduce a cariogenic challenge on Sound buccal enamel surface in vivo, specially designed orthodontic bands were attached to premolars scheduled for extraction for orthodontic reasons. The bands were modified by having two metal wires (0·8 mm in diameter) welded to the inner surface of the band to produce a space for plaque accumulation similar to that occurring under loose orthodontic bands. The bands were cemented with a zinc phosphate cement (Tenet®) an left in situ for 4 weeks. Of 22 premolar teeth banded in eight different patients, eight showed definite white spot lesions, eight showed definite faint enamel opacities, and six showed no discernable lesions. Examination of definite white spot lesions by scanning electron microscopy revealed characteristic patterns of initial tissue destruction. Focal holes and an accentuation of the perikymata were observed affecting the enamel surface zone, an area previously considered to remain relatively intact during the development of a caries lesion. The superficial nature of the caries lesions observed and the rapidly of their formation is significant in the clinical management of decalcified areas forming beneath orthodontics bands.;Yes;Yes;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/807a040a3d2cd3616e1ca425081da74ef7fd011a

Learning methods could help to autonomously discover relevant grasping movements, but they face an important issue: grasping movements are so rare that a learning method based on exploration has little chance to ever observe an interesting movement, thus creating a bootstrap issue. We introduce an approach to generate diverse grasping movements in order to solve this problem. The movements are generated in simulation, for particular object positions. We test it on several simulated robots: Baxter, Pepper and a Kuka Iiwa arm.

Materials and Methods: One-hundred-and-twenty mandibular third molars were embedded in acrylic resin blocks with the buccal surface of crowns perpendicular to the base of the mold. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups containing 30 teeth each. Groups 1 and 3 were cemented using conventional GIC and groups 2 and 4 were cemented using ACP-containing orthodontic cement. Groups 1 and 2 without thermocycling, and groups 3 and 4 after thermocycling (5000 cycles, 5° to 55°C) were tested for retentive strength using a universal testing machine (crosshead speed of 1mm/minute). Two-way ANOVA was performed to compare the retentive strength of the groups. Results: The highest retentive strength belonged to group 1, and it was significantly higher than that of group 2 (P<0.001) and group 3 (P=0.02). The mean strength for group 2 was significantly lower than that of group 1 (P<0.001) and group 4 (P=0.04). Conclusions: Although retentive strength decreased when ACP was added to GIC, the retentive strength of the samples cemented by ACP-containing GIC was remarkably high after thermocycling. It seems that in the oral cavity, ACP-containing GIC provides sufficient strength to endure forces applied on posterior teeth.;Yes;No;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c063d1e62ff8c61c1142721f133a5fc84e173e71

Failure rate of brackets and tubes placed in a group of 158 consecutive patients was evaluated after a mean period of 67 weeks after bonding., , , RESULTS, The failure rate in the group without atropine sulfate premedication was 2.4%. In the group with premedication, the failure rate was 2.7%. The Cox regression analysis of these groups showed that atropine application did not lead to a reduction in bond failures. Statistically significant differences in the hazard ratio were found for the bracket regions and for the dental assistants who prepared for the bonding procedure., , , CONCLUSIONS, Premedication did not lead to fewer bracket failures. The roles of the dental assistant and patient in preventing failures was relevant.

DESCRIPTION A 59yearold man with a medical history of hypertension presented to the hospital with chest discomfort with swallowing and a feeling of food ‘getting stuck’ in his chest on swallowing solids. The patient had dyspnoea on exertion but denied any orthopnoea, dizziness, lower extremity swelling or palpitations. On physical examination, his blood pressure was significantly elevated to 250/130 mm Hg, and breath sounds were slightly diminished bilaterally on auscultation without any wheezing or crackles. On presentation, his troponin I was elevated to 4.65 ng/L (0.00–0.06 ng/L), which increased to 32.6 ng/L. ECG did not show any STsegment or Twave changes. CT of the neck with contrast showed a nonspecific narrowing of the supraglottic airway without any mass or fluid collection and a retrooesophageal/retrotracheal aberrant right subclavian artery (figure 1). The patient was started on aspirin, ticagrelor, intravenous heparin and atorvastatin. Left coronary angiogram through right radial access showed a proximal occlusion of the left circumflex artery, and a drugeluting stent was placed. Arteria lusoria accounted for the clinical dysphagia that the patient reported as his oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was found to be negative. This case illustrates the significance of an anomalous retrooesophageal right subclavian artery resulting in dysphagia symptoms that may be found incidentally on the coronary angiogram. Anomalous right subclavian artery (ARSA) is also known as arteria lusoria. It is one of the most common aortic arch anomalies with a prevalence of around 0.5%–2.5% in the general population. The right subclavian artery originates as the last branch of the aortic arch, travels towards and then down the right arm after crossing the midline of the body commonly, between the oesophagus and vertebral column (80% of cases) and less commonly, between the trachea and oesophagus (15% of cases). Most patients remain symptomfree throughout their lifetime, while others can develop symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnoea, coughing, pyrosis, retrosternal pain, acute limb ischaemia and even Horner’s syndrome. The clinical manifestations of arteria lusoria result from the compression of the oesophagus by the anteriorly placed right common carotid artery and trachea with the posteriorly coursing right subclavian artery. In 0.05%–0.1% of the population, dysphagia lusoria can also result from a left subclavian artery in the presence of a rightsided aortic arch and leftsided ligamentous arteriosum, which causes more severe symptoms due to the formation of a true vascular ring that constricts the oesophagus and trachea more significantly compared with the ARSA. Our patient presented with chest pain secondary to a nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction and dysphagia, which was secondary to a retrooesophageal aberrant right subclavian artery. Patients are usually treated symptomatically with proton pump inhibitors, alcohol and smoking cessation, but surgical intervention may be required if symptoms become severe and intractable.

There is an inter-dependency between the sub-problems, making it impossible to solve such a problem by focusing on only one component. The traveling thief problem (TTP) belongs to this category and is formed by the integration of the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and the knapsack problem (KP). In this paper, we investigate the inter-dependency of the TSP and the KP by means of quality diversity (QD) approaches. QD algorithms provide a powerful tool not only to obtain high-quality solutions but also to illustrate the distribution of high-performing solutions in the behavioural space. We introduce a MAP-Elite based evolutionary algorithm using well-known TSP and KP search operators, taking the TSP and KP score as behavioural descriptor. Afterwards, we conduct comprehensive experimental studies that show the usefulness of using the QD approach applied to the TTP. First, we provide insights regarding high-quality TTP solutions in the TSP/KP behavioural space. Afterwards, we show that better solutions for the TTP can be obtained by using our QD approach and it can improve the best-known solution for a wide range of TTP instances used for benchmarking in the literature.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7aa6eaeff251632c73f251590e95637e8e44c71

A wide range of methods using evolutionary computation techniques has been introduced in recent years. With this paper, we contribute to this area of research by providing a new approach based on quality diversity (QD) that is able to explore the whole feature space. QD algorithms allow to create solutions of high quality within a given feature space by splitting it up into boxes and improving solution quality within each box.

This can provide the practitioners with invaluable information about the solution space and robustness against imperfect modelling and minor problems' changes. It also enables the decision-makers to involve their interests and choose between various solutions. In this study, we investigate for the first time a prominent multi-component optimisation problem, namely the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP), in the context of evolutionary diversity optimisation. We introduce a bi-level evolutionary algorithm to maximise the structural diversity of the set of solutions. Moreover, we examine the inter-dependency among the components of the problem in terms of structural diversity and empirically determine the best method to obtain diversity. We also conduct a comprehensive experimental investigation to examine the introduced algorithm and compare the results to another recently introduced framework based on the use of Quality Diversity (QD).

They aim to maximize the quality of solutions for different regions of the so-called behavioural space of the underlying problem. In this paper, we apply the QD paradigm to simulate dynamic programming behaviours on knapsack problem, and provide a ﬁrst runtime analysis of QD algorithms. We show that they are able to compute an optimal solution within expected pseudo-polynomial time, and reveal parameter settings that lead to a fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS).

Professor first baby you say city.;Poster;Prototyping robotic systems is a time consuming process. Computer aided design, however, might speed up the process significantly. Quality-diversity evolutionary approaches optimise for novelty as well as performance, and can be used to generate a repertoire of diverse designs. This design repertoire could be used as a tool to guide a designer and kick-start the rapid prototyping process. This paper explores this idea in the context of mechanical linkage based robots. These robots can be a good test-bed for rapid prototyping, as they can be modified quickly for swift iterations in design. We compare three evolutionary algorithms for optimising 2D mechanical linkages: 1) a standard evolutionary algorithm, 2) the multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II, and 3) the quality-diversity algorithm MAP-Elites. Some of the found linkages are then realized on a physical hexapod robot through a prototyping process, and tested on two different floors. We find that all the tested approaches, except the standard evolutionary algorithm, are capable of finding mechanical linkages that creates a path similar to a specified desired path. However, the quality-diversity approaches that had the length of the linkage as a behaviour descriptor were the most useful when prototyping. This was due to the quality-diversity approaches having a larger variety of similar designs to choose from, and because the search could be constrained by the behaviour descriptors to make linkages that were viable for construction on our hexapod platform.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d546819cbeaf03a0c53b47e713529f64d717be7

Typical methods to solve it aim to reduce the search space by minimizing unwanted interactions through restrictions on the design (e.g. staples in DNA origami or voxel-based designs in DNA Bricks). Here, we present a novel methodology that aims to reduce this search space by identifying the relevant properties of a given assembly system to the emergence of various families of structures (e.g. simple structures, polymers, branched structures). For a given set of DNA strands, our approach automatically finds chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that generate sets of structures exhibiting ranges of specific user-specified properties, such as length and type of structures or their frequency of occurrence. For each set, we enumerate the possible DNA structures that can be generated through domain-level interactions, identify the most prevalent structures, find the best-performing sequence sets to the emergence of target structures, and assess CRNs' robustness to the removal of reaction pathways. Our results suggest a connection between the characteristics of DNA strands and the distribution of generated structure families.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57ba578923047838f7a1d2842a29b0c34ce81317

To illuminate the elite solutions for a space of behaviors, QD algorithms require the definition of a suitable behavior space. If the behavior space is high-dimensional, a suitable dimensionality reduction technique is required to maintain a limited number of behavioral niches. While current methodologies for automated behavior spaces focus on changing the geometry of the behavior space or on unsupervised learning of its key features, there remains a need for customizing behavioral diversity to a particular meta-objective specified by the end user. In the newly emerging framework of QD Meta-Evolution, or QD-Meta for short, one evolves a population of QD algorithms, each with different algorithmic and representational characteristics, to optimize the algorithms and their resulting archives to a user-defined meta-objective. Despite promising results compared to traditional QD algorithms, QD-Meta has yet to be compared to state-of-the-art behavior space automation methods, such as centroidal voronoi tessellations multidimensional archive of phenotypic elites (CVT-MAP-Elites) and autonomous robots realizing their abilities (AURORAs). This article performs an empirical study of QD-Meta on function optimization and multilegged robot locomotion benchmarks. Results demonstrate that QD-Meta archives provide improved average performance and faster adaptation to a priori unknown changes to the environment when compared to CVT-MAP-Elites and AURORA. A qualitative analysis shows how the resulting archives are tailored to the meta-objectives provided by the end user.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/666b452b1c79ec29cb934d62390815c7c1745f3f

Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight human premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes were divided into 4 groups (n=22). In groups 1 and 2, 22 metal and ceramic brackets were bonded using composite resin (Transbond XT), respectively. Twenty-two metal and ceramic brackets in groups 3 and 4, respectively were bonded using RMGI (Fuji Ortho LC, Japan). After photo polymerization, the teeth were stored in water and thermocycled (500 cycles between 5° and 55°). The SBS value of each sample was determined using a Universal Testing Machine. The amount of residual adhesive remaining on each tooth was evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analyses were done using two-way ANOVA. Results: RMGI bonded brackets had significantly lower SBS value compared to composite resin bonded groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between metal and ceramic brackets bonded with either the RMGI or composite resin. The comparison of the adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores between the groups indicated that the bracket failure mode was significantly different among groups (P<0.001) with more adhesive remaining on the teeth bonded with composite resin. Conclusion: RMGIs have significantly lower SBS compared to composite resin for orthodontic bonding purposes; however the provided SBS is still within the clinically acceptable range.;No;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b34f942df038c3e6fada2a15c1c863dfdbd514c3

However, most of those algorithms rely on a behavioural descriptor to characterise the diversity that is hand-coded, hence requiring prior knowledge about the considered tasks. In this work, we introduce Relevance-guided Unsupervised Discovery of Abilities; a Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously finds a behavioural characterisation tailored to the task at hand. In particular, our method introduces a custom diversity metric that leads to higher densities of solutions near the areas of interest in the learnt behavioural descriptor space. We evaluate our approach on a simulated robotic environment, where the robot has to autonomously discover its abilities based on its full sensory data. We evaluated the algorithms on three tasks: navigation to random targets, moving forward with a high velocity, and performing half-rolls. The experimental results show that our method manages to discover collections of solutions that are not only diverse, but also well-adapted to the considered downstream task.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45e78371d9c318b1cdf580d08eda29c7536877d1

The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to evaluate bracket failure rates., , , RESULTS, Statistically significant differences in survival rates were observed between molar tubes and anterior brackets (P < .05). Twelve-month failure rates of incisor, canine, premolar, and molar brackets were 3.6, 1.6, 4.8, and 11.6%, respectively. The first and second molar did not show significant difference in bond failure. Young patients (age <18 years) showed a higher failure rate than old patients (≥18 years)., , , CONCLUSIONS, Brackets directly bonded to the buccal surfaces of molars failed significantly more often than those directly bonded to anterior teeth or premolars, but showed acceptable failure rate especially in adult patients.

Materials and Methods: The tested cements were exposed in vitro to mouse fibroblast cells for 1 h at 37°C. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were evaluated by means of the single cell gel (Comet Assay) and the trypan blue exclusion test, respectively. All data were assessed by the Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test, followed by Dunn's test. P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Results: Significant statistically differences (P < 0.05) in cytotoxicity were observed for both Vidrion C powder and liquid at the tested concentrations, with exception to the group presenting the lowest powder concentration. OptiBand similarly presented induced cellular death at the highest tested concentration for paste A (P < 0.05). Band-Lok paste B was also able to induce cytotoxicity at the highest tested concentration. Regarding the comet assay, Band-Lok paste B and OptiBand paste A resulted in increased DNA injury (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The obtained results support the thought that some glass ionomer cement components present both genotoxic and cytotoxic effects when in high concentrations. Since DNA damage and cellular death are important events during oncogenesis, this study represents relevant contribution to estimate the real risks induced by these materials upon cellular systems.;Yes;No;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad18bf25bbdeb05df80729b9416fc5bc9cd1fbe6

After 24 hours, 72 hours, seven days, and 28 days, the specimens were taken out, dried in a desiccator, and re-weighed. Percentage of solubility at each time period was calculated as 100 per cent times weight loss divided by the initial weight of the specimen. Analysis of variance and LSD multiple comparison test were applied. It was found that cement type, storage time, and medium pH exerted statistically significant (p<0.001) effects on solubility.

Two communicating nodes can use the information obtained by their respective channel estimation in order to adjust the transmission parameters to the channel characteristics.

Though human form wide born.;FullPaper;Bidirectional underwater acoustic communications usually request the transmission of some control information among nodes to govern the data flow. Control signaling, employed as frame reception validation, is also a peculiarity of the Automatic Repeat on reQuest (ARQ) schemes. An alternative solution to the error control problem is using forward error correction, even though high redundancy is needed to obtain the low error rate, hence leading to a sensible throughput reduction. Furthermore, no control on data integrity is allowed. For the above reasons, we explore the possibility of implementing three different ARQ schemes by considering only the use of an explicit negative acknowledgment (NACK) for requiring frames retransmission. Specifically, the NACK frame index is related to a frequency-dependent message and the information frame(s) to be retransmitted are recognized, owing to a frequency-domain detection mechanism. Moreover, the proposed solution is very efficient when applied in a broadcast environment since it overcomes the necessity of performing a multiuser detection at the centralized broadcaster. In this context, we report both simulations and experimental tests results to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.;Yes;No;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bd0f8531b4c04c16c93962c4b870912bb9dcc18

We also provide a real data application of our filter for underwater 3 dimensional (3-D) scene reconstruction, i.e. bathymetry. Shallow water environments generally involve multi-path propagation channels. Coupled with impulsive, heavy-tailed backscattered signals it generates spurious estimates. To counteract this situation, particle filtering enables taking into account the impulsive nature of signals and regularizing the DOA trajectories by means of state-space description. For a specific double target tracking scenario, an automatic target detection and initialization scheme is presented. The state-space description incorporates and merges the available prior information on the imaged scene.

The presence of multipath echoes and volume reverberation generates false depth estimates. To improve the resulting bathymetry, this paper proposes and develops an adaptive filter, based on several original geometrical models. This multimodel approach makes it possible to track and separate the direction of arrival trajectories of multiple echoes impinging the array. Echo tracking is perceived as a model-based processing stage, incorporating prior information on the temporal evolution of echoes in order to reject cluttered observations generated by interfering echoes. The results of the proposed filter on simulated and real sonar data showcase the clutter-free and regularized bathymetric reconstruction. Model validation is carried out with goodness of fit tests, and demonstrates the importance of model-based processing for bathymetry reconstruction.;Yes;No;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b0e8b516aefc72db0d7cd724f48d9e93cb82cbb

Bathymetry reconstruction of underwater environments is of great importance for applications ranging from infrastructure inspection to intrusion detection. Side-scan images, that is, two-dimensional (2-D) images of the backscattered signal amplitude are affected by the layover phenomenon, i.e., superposition of echoes. This phenomenon appears in the presence of tall objects, whenever the pulse emitted by the sonar ensonifies the top of the object before the bottom. In such, the area around the object is not entirely observable and a full 3-D bathymetry reconstruction is necessary. For sidelooking sonar arrays, bathymetry is obtained by triangulating the scatterers corresponding to each range bin, or equivalently, estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of backscattered echoes.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46bee92ba312f8bf9cea204533bc80415206a907

The phased-array model poses a new problem since each target emits a signal, called source signal. Existing methods consider the source signal as part of the system state. This is inefficient, especially for particle approximations of posteriors, where samples are drawn from the higher-dimensional posterior of the extended state. To address this problem, we propose a novel Marked Poisson Point Process (MPPP) model and derive the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter that adaptively estimates target DOAs. The PPP models variations of both the number and the location of points representing targets. The mark of a point represents the source signal, without the need of an extended state. Recursive formulas for the MPPP PHD filter are derived with simulations showcasing improved performance over state-of-the art methods.;Yes;No;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e893f00fe1c373a8c27bd274670a1a45f2cb14b

Hence, in this work we derive the bathymetric map of a very shallow water reservoir by using a sonar system characterized by two separated devices, one transmitting and one receiving so allowing the signal detection also during signal transmission. This allows to consider very shallow depths, of the order of few meters, and the system proposed is also low cost.

Unitek maxillary and mandibular 1st and 2nd primary molar SSC were fitted with one of four commonly used orthodontic bands (Unitek regular, Unitek narrow, Rocky Mountain, or custom bands made from SSC) using glass ionomer cement. The cemented samples were tested for their resistance to dislodgment on the Instron Universal Testing Machine (Instron Engineering Corp., Canton, MA) in tensile mode. Alpha level for statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05. Unitek regular bands cemented on the 2nd molar crowns and Unitek narrow bands cemented on the 1st molar crown samples had equivalent or superior resistance to dislodgment compared with the other bands in the study. When the inside of the band and the outside band-bearing surfaces of selected crowns were lightly scored with a diamond bur prior to cementation, samples exhibited significantly superior retention. Subgroup means increased from 107 to 330%, compared to the values obtained in their preroughened state.

The research of the last 10 years has resulted in four main types, classified by matrix-forming species: (1) phosphate, (2) phenolate, (3) polycarboxylate, and (4) polymethacrylate. The zinc phosphate cements continue to be widely used for luting in an essentially unchanged form. Acidity and oral dissolution remain as problems. The zinc-oxide eugenol cements and their modifications are useful as linings and temporary materials but are susceptible to hydrolytic breakdown. Vanillate cements may be an improvement. Calcium hydroxide-salicylate cements are widely used as cavity linings, especially on exposures, and show improved resistance to acid dissolution. Polycarboxylate cements as both zinc polycarboxylate and glass-ionomer cements show adhesion potential, good physical properties, fluoride release, and, generally, good biological properties. Glass-ionomer cements when correctly manipulated show minimal oral dissolution. Polymethacrylate cements have been used principally for bonding etched cast metal restorations to etched enamel. Recently, adhesive crown-and-bridge cements have been developed. There are no well-established correlations between laboratory measurements of apparently relevant properties and clinical performance.

The likelihood is derived from first order principles along with the assumption that the source signal can be approximated as white Gaussian noise within the considered frequency band. The resulting likelihood is a nonlinear function of the delay-and-sum beamformer response and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).Evaluation of the proposed likelihood function is done by using it in a Bernoulli filter based track-before-detect (TkBD) framework. As a reference, the same TkBD framework, but with another beamforming response based likelihood, is used. Results from Monte-Carlo simulations of two bearings-only tracking scenarios are presented. The results show that the TkBD framework with the proposed likelihood yields an approx. 10 seconds faster target detection for a target at an SNR of -27 dB, and a lower bearing tracking error. Compared to a classical detect-and-track target tracker, the TkBD framework with the proposed likelihood yields 4 dB to 5 dB detection gain.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/024c0a7da3454897f4128af9c8cd1082237cff8b

The key process in this work involves obtaining the target’s position in space using two images of the same scene, acquired by an adaptive resolution imaging sonar (ARIS) at different positions. A data association algorithm was designed to connect the same target in image sequences. The goal of this work was to track multiple targets in 3D space. The ARIS provides sequences of bi-dimensional images from the backscattered energy according to the range and azimuth. The challenge involved determining the missing elevation information for the observed object within the sonar detection range. By computing the geometrical transformation between the acquisition planar images and the cubical space, using only the sonar information that included the posture and moving speed of the ARIS, the target’s elevation information was obtained. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an indoor experiment was conducted using the ARIS. On the basis of the experimental results, we confirmed that the proposed method effectively obtained the target’s position in 3D space.

Account surface personal main seat up decide perform. Example church eight nature go executive own.;DemoPaper;3D sonar image reconstruction is the basis of sonar detection. But the distribution of sonar data is stereoscopic and multilayered, and the background echo noise is much. The traditional Mesh search will produce a large number of invalid triangular facets and lots of holes will be formed. The paper presents a new sonar image reconstruction method. In order to achieve the surface reconstruction of sonar target efficiently, the method firstly performs 2×2 grid block search for nonempty sonar data points using the adaptive threshold, and then searches for the 3×3 grid blocks with the empty point as the center to reduce the sonar image holes. Then the system performs 3×2 horizontal grid blocks and 2×3 vertical grid blocks search for sonar arrays to further improve the connectivity relation by finding the semi-diagonal connection. Finally, a triangular connection and reconstruction are performed on the basis of the obtained sonar data point connectivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method can correctly reflects the underwater terrain.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f5b5860812ae16ce3ea3c8c1119f37afba383ec

Strategy effort firm face., Along sign environmental century summer of. Last game around according blue tonight.;FullPaper;In this work, we propose a family of sensor-activation policies coupled with a learning method for information-seeking sensor activation in multisensor Bernoulli tracking applications. Sensor activation, and sensor management more generally, are of great interest in multi-agent networks and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where limited energy, sensing, and communication resources have to be efficiently allocated for optimal inference. Non-myopic control, resource constraints, and the partial observability of the Bernoulli target are the main challenges addressed in this work. The novelty of our approach is threefold. First, a belief-space Markov decision process (MDP) reformulation is proposed for the Bernoulli tracking and control problem that incorporates uncertainties in both object existence and object state. Second, a parametric family of sensor-activation distributions is proposed as control policies that harness the mutual information between the sensor measurements and the belief state. Thirdly, a novel reward metric is employed to capture the information gain on the Bernoulli belief state of a specific combination of sensor activations. A Bayesian actor-critic (BAC) reinforcement learning (RL) methodology is employed to further refine the policy by maximizing a discounted reward over an infinite horizon and under an imposed activation constraint. Numerical simulations validate our approach and show an improved tracking performance over a uniform sensor-activation method.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74425ed75591a8eb0357fdb058ed248111d824ac

The mathematical relations between the signal covariance matrix, the sources steering vectors, and the power of the sources are developed in order to expose the contribution of each source. Algorithms to find each of the source’s DOA and their respective power are presented. The source elimination method (SEM), based on the elimination of the contribution of each source to improve the DOA estimation, is developed. Monte Carlo simulations are presented, showing that SEM yields more accurate results than multiple signal classification (MUSIC) with forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) to find the echoes’ DOA with an echo-to-noise ratio between −13 and −17 dB.

Evening interesting second film son own.;DemoPaper;Received: 10 January 2020 Accepted: 15 April 2020 The direction of arrival (DOA) is traditionally estimated by subspace algorithms. However, the computation of subspace algorithms is complicated by eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or singular value decomposition (SVD). To simplify subspace algorithms, this paper proposes a fast one-dimensional (1D) DOA estimation algorithm for double parallel linear array (DPLA). In our algorithm, the equivalent noise subspace is constructed by processing the first column elements of the joint cross-covariance matrix (JCCM), and the DOA is estimated, using the root-multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The algorithm effectively simplifies and speeds up the computation by eliminating EVD or SVD. Simulation results confirm that our algorithm can improve the accuracy and reduce the time of DOA estimation. The research results have great application potential in DOA estimation tasks.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39bce668f0a4e70bbeb455a38abd308fe9941a81

Young various administration sell minute ten.;ShortPaper;In this paper we propose a novel Track Before Detect (TBD) filter aimed at tracking multiple extended targets from phased-array observations. For extended targets, the source signal is angularly distributed, and hence we track the centroid Direction Of Arrival (DOA) of the target generated signal - called target signal. In this work we suppose known the shape and extent of the target-signal angular spread. Solutions based on extending the system state, to include the target signal, lead to higher-dimensional posteriors. We avoid an extended state by using a novel Marked Poisson Point Process (MPPP) model for the system, and accordingly, we derive the intensity/PHD filter that adaptively estimates target number and corresponding centroid DOAs. The source signals are interpreted as the mark of a target, and they are analytically integrated in the update formula of the filter. Therefore, an efficient particle filter implementation is possible.

Population wind station state anything. Mean offer open second. Color specific than protect history.;FullPaper;In this paper, we propose a novel phased-array track before detect (TBD) filter for tracking multiple distributed (extended) targets from impulsive observations. Since the targets are angularly spread, we track the centroid Direction Of Arrival (DOA) of the target-generated (or backscattered) signal. The main challenge stems from the random target signals that, conditional to their respective states, constitute non-deterministic contributions to the system observation. The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we develop a Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter for tracking multiple targets with non-deterministic contributions, more specifically, Spherically Invariant Random Vector (SIRV) processes. This is achieved by analytically integrating the SIRV and angularly distributed target signals in the update step. Thus, ensuring a more efficient implementation than existing solutions, that generally consider augmenting the target state with the target signal. Secondly, we provide an improved auxiliary particle CPHD filter and clustering methodology. The auxiliary step is carried out for persistent particles, while for newly birthed particles an adaptive importance distribution is given. This is in contrast with existing solutions that only consider the auxiliary step for birthed particles. Simulated data results showcase the improved performance of the proposed filter.

Most DOA estimation methods use second-order measurements in the form of covariance matrices obtained from consecutive snapshots of the array elements’ raw data. In this paper, we pose the covariance-based DOA estimation problem in the random finite set framework of multitarget tracking using a superpositional model. The superpositional model allows for the measurements to be directly incorporated into a track-before-detect approximate cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter with a likelihood distributed as a complex Wishart random matrix that can perform DOA tracking with unknown time-varying number of sources. Complex Wishart and inverse-Wishart conjugacy is employed to derive the filter's update equations.

Materials and Methods 219 human pituitary tumors and 12 normal pituitary glands were studied. Angiogenic genes were quantified by an angiogenesis qPCR array and a TaqMan probe-based absolute qPCR. Angiogenesis inhibition in pituitary tumors was evaluated in vitro with the endothelial tube formation assay and in vivo in RbΔ19 mice. Results 71 angiogenic genes, 40 of which are known to be involved in sprouting angiogenesis, were differentially expressed in pituitary tumors. Expression of endothelial markers CD31, CD34, and ENG was significantly higher in pituitary tumors, by 5.6, 22.3, and 8.2-fold, respectively, compared to in normal pituitary tissue. There was no significant difference in levels of the lymphatic endothelial marker LYVE1 in pituitary tumors compared with normal pituitary gland tissue. Pituitary tumors also expressed significantly higher levels of angiogenesis growth factors, including VEGFA (4.2-fold), VEGFB (2.2), VEGFC (19.3), PGF (13.4), ANGPT2 (9.2), PDGFA (2.7), PDGFB (10.5) and TGFB1 (3.8) compared to normal pituitary tissue. Expression of VEGFC and PGF was highly correlated with the expression of endothelial markers in tumor samples, including CD31, CD34, and ENG (endoglin, a co-receptor for TGFβ). Furthermore, VEGFR inhibitors inhibited angiogenesis induced by human pituitary tumors and prolonged survival of RbΔ19 mice. Conclusion Human pituitary tumors are characterized by more active angiogenesis than normal pituitary gland tissue in a manner consistent with sprouting angiogenesis. Angiogenesis in pituitary tumors is regulated mainly by PGF and VEGFC, not VEGFA and VEGFB. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as the VEGFR2 inhibitor cabozantinib, may merit further investigation as therapies for aggressive human pituitary tumors.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65cda4195cd39ab51306f76afd1dae64773265e1

However, the effects of smoking plus morphine (SM + M) on Treg plasticity remain unknown. To determine whether SM + M promotes Treg plasticity to T helper 17 (Th17) cells, we analyzed the RNA sequencing data from SM, M, and SM + M treated Tregs and performed knowledge-based and IPA analysis.

This study aimed to investigate whether diagnostic UMMC alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and, if so, through which mechanisms. DCM model was established by injecting streptozocin into rats to induce hyperglycemia, followed by a high‐fat diet. The combined therapy of cation microbubble with low‐intensity diagnostic ultrasound (frequency = 4 MHz), with a pulse frequency of 20 Hz and pulse length (PL) of 8, 18, 26, or 36 cycles, was given to rats twice a week for 8 consecutive weeks. Diagnostic UMMC therapy with PL at 8, 18, and 26 cycles, but not 36 cycles, dramatically prevented myocardial fibrosis, improved heart functions, and increased angiogenesis, accompanied by increased levels of PI3K, Akt, and eNOS proteins in the DCM model of rats. In cultured endothelial cells, low‐intensity UMMC treatment (PL = 3 cycles, sound pressure level = 50%, mechanical index = 0.82) increased cell viability and activated PI3K‐Akt‐eNOS signaling. The combination of diagnostic ultrasound with microbubble destruction dose‐dependently promoted angiogenesis, thus improving heart function through PI3K‐Akt‐eNOS signaling in diabetes. Accordingly, diagnostic UMMC therapy should be considered to protect the heart in patients with diabetes.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6606bf299b8d98ed0d8a59f14ca229fd4f550db

Mouth all list a.;DemoPaper;The purpose of this study was to evaluate, over an 18-month period, the clinical performances of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement for bonding orthodontic brackets and to analyze various factors that influenced their survival and failure rates. Two orthodontists using the edgewise technique participated in this study; 6113 brackets, including 20 molar tubes, were bonded with Fuji Ortho LC (GC, Europe, N.V. Leuven, Belgium) in 135 patients. Ceramic, metal, and resin brackets were tested, and both operators used the same bonding method for the brackets. The survival rate and the failure rate of the brackets were evaluated. The rates were determined by operator, bracket type, tooth position in the dental arch, and age and sex of the patients. Bracket survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier test. The Cox-Mantel statistical test with a level of significance set at 0.05 was used to compare survival curves. The chi-square test was used at a level of P < .05 to compare failure rates. The overall failure rate for the sample was 7%, and the overall survival rate was equal to 0.918. Age had no significant influence on the failure rate (P = .07); however, it had a significant influence on the survival rate (P < .01). The best survival rates were obtained in the groups aged 16 to 20 years (S[t] = 0.943) and older than 20 years (S[t] = 0.929). The difference between males and females was not statistically significant in terms of failure rate (P = .17). However, the Cox-Mantel test showed a higher bracket survival rate for the males (S[t] = 0.924) than for the females (S[t] = 0.839) (P < .00001). The influence of the operator was not statistically significant on the failure rate (P = .08); however, it was significant on the survival rate (P < .0002). Location in the arch had a significant influence on the failure and survival rates. The worst results were obtained in the upper incisors and the canines, and the best results in the lower premolars. Fifteen percent of the molar tubes failed; their survival rate was equal to 0.833. The failure rate was significantly greater for resin brackets than for metal or ceramic brackets (P = .007). The highest survival rate was obtained with ceramic brackets (P = .0001). This in vivo study showed that bonding brackets and molar tubes with Fuji Ortho LC is compatible with clinical orthodontic practice.;No;Yes;2001;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f3cc9266f5fb0e9a2d8e8342e9ddc5294bc65cb

The effect of the patients' sex, age at the start of treatment and presenting malocclusion on bracket survival time was assessed also. Forty-five consecutive patients who attended for fixed appliance therapy were randomly selected. Four hundred twenty-six brackets were bonded (213 with compomer and 213 with resin adhesive) with a split mouth design; the right or left side allocation of compomer in either arch was alternated. Color transparencies of the maxillary incisors, mandibular incisors, or both, and transparencies of the canines, were taken before treatment. At the debond stage, the transparencies were projected (20x) and assessed by an experienced examiner, who used a caries index. The survival time distributions for brackets bonded with each bonding agent were not significantly different (P = .74, paired Prentice-Wilcoxon test; P = .75, Akritas test), with bracket failure rates of 17% and 20% recorded for compomer and resin adhesive, respectively. Neither the patients' sex (P = .85) nor malocclusion (P = .26) appear to affect significantly bracket survival, but patient age was identified as a useful prognostic indicator of bracket survival (P < .001). On average, there was more decalcification related to brackets bonded with resin adhesive than with compomer (P = .0075). Survival time distributions of brackets bonded with compomer or resin adhesive appear comparable, but decalcification was reduced significantly by bonding with compomer.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a05dd0cbb36fcd6c8869e76790f917537fb6a00f

Million property least off nation two.;DemoPaper;In a bistatic scenario, we consider the task of simultaneously estimating the positions of a non-cooperative transmitter and landmarks that reflect the transmitted signal, generating bistatic measurements at the receiver. Neither the position of the transmitter, nor the timing of transmissions are known to the receiver. With the use of the horizontal multi-path measurements caused by multiple reflection at the landmarks, the estimation of the unknown landmark locations is possible conditional upon the knowledge of the transmitter position. Thus two interdependent estimation problems arise in a similar fashion to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. An approach using a factorized density in a similar way to FastSLAM 2.0 is used. In contrast to the SLAM problem, the differing receiver and transmitter positions lead to a measurement function that is not only non-linear but also non-invertible. Due to the nature of the measurements, a particle filter is used to estimate the landmark as well as the transmitter receiver system state.

Site financial husband.;DemoPaper;In an experimental study the bond strength of stainless steel, ceramic and plastic brackets to bovine enamel was investigated by tensile testing. The brackets were cemented to the enamel using a conventional two-paste orthodontic bonding resin, a light-cured, fluoride-releasing adhesive, a no-mix-orthodontic bonding resin and a light-curing glass ionomer cement. For evaluation of the experimental data the Weibull analysis was applied. The highest values for the Weibull modulus (m) and the 10 per cent probability of failure (sigma.10) were found in the tested plastic brackets (Dentaurum Edgewise plastic bracket and Spirit bracket) using a no-mix orthodontic bonding resin (System 1). However, the tensile stresses for the 90 per cent probability of failure (sigma.90) were over 10 MPa and carried the danger of enamel fracture. Bracket bonding with glass ionomer cement cannot be recommended because of the low bond strength values for the 10 per cent probability of failure (sigma.10). The most favourable bracket-bonding system concerning the Weibull modulus (m), the 10 and 90 per cent probabilities of failure (sigma.10 and sigma.90) and aesthetics was the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured, fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding resin (Sequence). Bond fracture occurred predominantly between bracket and orthodontic bonding resin, with two exceptions. Concerning the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured glass ionomer cement (Photac Fil), there was no preferential site of failure. Regarding the ceramic bracket with the silane-treated base (Allure III) using the light-cured, fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding resin (Sequence), bracket fracture was seen more often than bond separation between bracket and enamel. When the bond failure was located at the enamel-orthodontic bonding resin interface enamel prisms could be identified on the adhesive site by scanning electron microscopy.;Yes;Yes;1997;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a826bae3cb881bef76a90b034d170b56d72a4237

In this paper, the detection and tracking of an unknown and time-varying number of targets for a towed sonar system is considered. To enhance the detection and tracking performance, a track-before-detect (TBD) based signal processing method is devised. Specifically, the raw bearing measurements generated after acoustic signal beamforming are directly used as the inputs of the proposed TBD processor. To handle the nonlinearity between target states and the raw bearing measurements, particle filter is employed to compute the joint multitarget probability density (JMPD) recursively through a Bayesian framework. Besides, the target initiation and termination steps are integrated into the particle filtering process as well to deal with the random births and deaths of multiple targets. The effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical experiment.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73b4c94db32b995dc1ab7c9febe79de2417f0d68

Money college onto firm.;FullPaper;Tumor-induced remodeling of the microenvironment in lymph nodes (LNs) includes the formation of blood vessels, which goes beyond the regulation of metabolism, and shaping a survival niche for tumor cells. In contrast to solid tumors, which primarily rely on neo-angiogenesis, hematopoietic malignancies usually grow within pre-vascularized autochthonous niches in secondary lymphatic organs or the bone marrow. The mechanisms of vascular remodeling in expanding LNs during infection-induced responses have been studied in more detail; in contrast, insights into the conditions of lymphoma growth and lodging remain enigmatic. Based on previous murine studies and clinical trials in human, we conclude that there is not a universal LN-specific angiogenic program applicable. Instead, signaling pathways that are tightly connected to autochthonous and infiltrating cell types contribute variably to LN vascular expansion. Inflammation related angiogenesis within LNs relies on dendritic cell derived pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in fibroblastic reticular cells, which in turn triggers vessel growth. In high-grade B cell lymphoma, angiogenesis correlates with poor prognosis. Lymphoma cells immigrate and grow in LNs and provide pro-angiogenic growth factors themselves. In contrast to infectious stimuli that impact on LN vasculature, they do not trigger the typical inflammatory and hypoxia-related stroma-remodeling cascade. Blood vessels in LNs are unique in selective recruitment of lymphocytes via high endothelial venules (HEVs). The dissemination routes of neoplastic lymphocytes are usually disease stage dependent. Early seeding via the blood stream requires the expression of the homeostatic chemokine receptor CCR7 and of L-selectin, both cooperate to facilitate transmigration of tumor and also of protective tumor-reactive lymphocytes via HEV structures. In this view, the HEV route is not only relevant for lymphoma cell homing, but also for a continuous immunosurveillance. We envision that HEV functional and structural alterations during lymphomagenesis are not only key to vascular remodeling, but also impact on tumor cell accessibility when targeted by T cell–mediated immunotherapies.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc4f491e661f5170e3e957ae5e87160e2519b51c

Here, we hypothesized that bovine endometrial stem/progenitor cells participate in the postpartum regeneration of the endometrium. Flow cytometry analysis identified the presence of side population (SP) cells among endometrial stromal cells. Endometrial SP cells were shown to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. RNA-seq data showed that the gene expression pattern was different between bovine endometrial SP cells and main population cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified the enrichment of stemness genes in SP cells. Significantly (false discovery rate < 0.01) upregulated genes in SP cells contained several stem cell marker genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the upregulated genes in SP cells showed enrichment of terms related to RNA metabolic process and transcription. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of upregulated genes in SP cells revealed enrichment of signaling pathways associated with maintenance and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. The terms involved in TCA cycles were enriched in GO and KEGG pathway analysis of downregulated genes in SP cells. These results support the assumption that bovine endometrial SP cells exhibit characteristics of somatic stem/progenitor cells. The ratio of SP cells to endometrial cells was lowest on days 9–11 after parturition, which gradually increased thereafter. SP cells were shown to differentiate into epithelial cells. Collectively, these results suggest that bovine endometrial SP cells were temporarily reduced immediately after calving possibly due to their differentiation to provide new endometrial cells.

Call event plant represent.;FullPaper;Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting the adult population. OA is no longer thought to come from a purely biomechanical origin but rather one that has been increasingly recognized to include a persistent low-grade inflammatory component. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACSI) have become a widely used method for treating pain in patients with OA as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, as the disease progresses, IACSI become ineffective. FKBP51 is a regulatory protein of the glucocorticoid receptor function and have been shown to be dysregulated in several pathological scenario’s including chronic inflammation. Despite of these facts, to our knowledge, there are no previous studies of the expression and possible role of FKBP51 in OA. We investigated by double and triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy the cellular and subcellular expression of FKBP51 and its relations with inflammation factors in osteoarthritic knee joint tissues: specifically, in the tibial plateau knee cartilage, Hoffa’s fat pad and suprapatellar synovial tissue of the knee. Our results show co-expression of FKBP51 with TNF-α, IL-6, CD31 and CD34 in OA chondrocytes, synovial membrane cells and adipocytes in Hoffa’s fat pad. FKBP51 is also abundant in nerve fibers within the fat pad. Co-expression of FKBP51 protein with these markers may be indicative of its contribution to inflammatory processes and associated chronic pain in OA.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb2ebca5a4e3c3f20bf77f92a37aadb661811f3b

Background Oral mucosa substitutes could contribute to the clinical treatment of complex diseases affecting the oral cavity. Although several models of artificial oral mucosa have been described, biointegration is a major issue that could be favored by the generation of novel substitutes with increased vascularization potential once grafted in vivo. Methods Three types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and dental pulp, and their in vitro potential was evaluated by inducing differentiation to the endothelial lineage using conditioning media. Then, 3D models of human artificial oral mucosa were generated using biocompatible fibrin‐agarose biomaterials combined with human oral mucosa fibroblasts and each type of MSC before and after induction to the endothelial lineage, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as controls. The vascularization potential of each oral mucosa substitute was assessed in vitro and in vivo in nude mice. Results In vitro induction of MSCs kept in culture was able to increase the expression of VEGF, CD31, and vWF endothelial markers, especially in bone marrow and dental pulp‐MSCs, and numerous proteins with a role in vasculogenesis become overexpressed. Then, in vivo grafting resulted in a significant increase in blood vessels formation at the interface area between the graft and the host tissues, with significantly positive expression of VEGF, CD31, vWF, and CD34 as compared to negative controls, especially when pre‐differentiated MSCs derived from bone marrow and dental pulp were used. In addition, a significantly higher number of cells committed to the endothelial lineage expressing the same endothelial markers were found within the bioartificial tissue. Conclusion Our results suggest that the use of pre‐differentiated MSCs could contribute to a rapid generation of a vascular network that may favor in vivo biointegration of bioengineered human oral mucosa substitutes.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/853cc55665102457c46d8c221c683ba608f7cc89

Currently, palatal osteogenesis is receiving increasing attention. This is the first study to provide an overview of the osteogenesis process of the mouse hard palate. We found that the period in which avascular mesenchymal condensation becomes a vascularized bone structure corresponds to embryonic day (E) 14.5 to E16.5 in the hard palate. The ppmx and ppp differ remarkably in morphology and molecular respects during osteogenesis. Osteoclasts in the ppmx and ppp are heterogeneous. There was a multinucleated giant osteoclast on the bone surface at the lateral‐nasal side of the ppmx, while osteoclasts in the ppp were more abundant and adjacent to blood vessels but were smaller and had fewer nuclei. In addition, bone remodeling in the hard palate was asymmetric and exclusively occurred on the nasal side of the hard palate at E18.5. During angiogenesis, CD31‐positive endothelial cells were initially localized in the surrounding of palatal mesenchymal condensation and then invaded the condensation in a sprouting fashion. At the transcriptome level, we found 78 differentially expressed genes related to osteogenesis and angiogenesis between the ppmx and ppp. Fifty‐five related genes were up/downregulated from E14.5 to E16.5. Here, we described the morphogenesis and the heterogeneity in the osteogenic and angiogenic genes profiles of the ppmx and ppp, which are significant for subsequent studies of normal and abnormal subjects.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d54d64981aa6db2ff90867da443a635678e3894b

Forskolin is a labdane diterpenoid isolated from the Indian Coleus plant. This small molecule is widely used as a supplement in molecular biology for cell differentiation. It has been reported in some earlier publications that forskolin can activate osteodifferentiation process by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) signalling activation in stem cells. In presented study it was demonstrated that forskolin release from halloysite-doped scaffolds induced the osteodifferentiation of equine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro without addition of any specific growth factors. The reinforcement of mechanical properties of cells and intercellular space during the osteodifferentiation was demonstrated using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

All patients were treated with Invisalign® (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Evaluated parameters were: upper/lower anterior arch length and intercanine distance, overjet, overbite, dental midline shift, and the irregularity index according to Little. The comparison achieved/predicted tooth movement was tested for equivalence [adjusted 98.57% confidence interval (- 1.00; + 1.00)]., , , RESULTS, Before treatment the anterior crowding, according to Little, was on average 5.39 mm (minimum 1.50 mm, maximum 14.50 mm) in the upper dentition and 5.96 mm (minimum 2.00 mm, maximum 11.50 mm) in the lower dentition. After treatment the values were reduced to 1.57 mm (minimum 0 mm, maximum 4.5 mm) in the maxilla and 0.82 mm (minimum 0 mm, maximum 2.50 mm) in the mandible. We found slight deviations between pretreatment casts and initialClinCheck® ranging on average from -0.08 mm (SD ± 0.29) for the overjet and up to -0.28 mm (SD ± 0.46) for the upper anterior arch length. The difference between achieved/predicted tooth movements ranged on average from 0.01 mm (SD ± 0.48) for the lower anterior arch length, up to 0.7 mm (SD ± 0.87) for the overbite. All parameters were significantly equivalent except for the overbite (-1.02; -0.39)., , , CONCLUSION, Performed with aligners (Invisalign®), the resolvement of the partly severe anterior crowding was successfully accomplished. Resolving lower anterior crowding by protrusion of the anterior teeth (i.e., enlargement of the anterior arch length) seems well predictable. The initial ClinCheck® models provided high accuracy compared to the initial casts. The achieved tooth movement was in concordance with the predicted movement for all parameters, except for the overbite.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68ae2ce6c5f89baeae78dcfff5e512629abce36d

We made the following primary findings: first, G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), the LPI receptor, is expressed in the endothelium of both human and mouse aortas, and is significantly upregulated in hyperlipidemia; second, LPIs upregulate 43 clusters of differentiation (CD) in HAECs, promoting EC activation, innate immune trans-differentiation, and immune/inflammatory responses; 72.1% of LPI-upregulated CDs are not induced in influenza virus-, MERS-CoV virus- and herpes virus-infected human endothelial cells, which hinted the specificity of LPIs in HAEC activation; third, LPIs upregulate six types of 640 secretomic genes (SGs), namely, 216 canonical SGs, 60 caspase-1-gasdermin D (GSDMD) SGs, 117 caspase-4/11-GSDMD SGs, 40 exosome SGs, 179 Human Protein Atlas (HPA)-cytokines, and 28 HPA-chemokines, which make HAECs a large secretory organ for inflammation/immune responses and other functions; fourth, LPIs activate transcriptomic remodeling by upregulating 172 transcription factors (TFs), namely, pro-inflammatory factors NR4A3, FOS, KLF3, and HIF1A; fifth, LPIs upregulate 152 nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial (mitoCarta) genes, which alter mitochondrial mechanisms and functions, such as mitochondrial organization, respiration, translation, and transport; sixth, LPIs activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) mechanism by upregulating 18 ROS regulators; finally, utilizing the Cytoscape software, we found that three mechanisms, namely, LPI-upregulated TFs, mitoCarta genes, and ROS regulators, are integrated to promote HAEC activation.

The efficiency of existing antivascular treatments remains unsatisfactory. The transition of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) into tumor endothelioid cells (ECs) has been thought to cause glioma neovascularization and anti-angiogenesis tolerance, but the mechanisms regulating glioma transdifferentiation remains unclear. Our previous study found that P4HA1 regulates GSCs vascular mimicry in a hypoxic microenvironment, but the detailed molecular mechanism has not been determined. In this study, candidate protein COL6A1 was screened by mass spectrometry. In vitro experiments show that P4HA1 regulates the expression of CD31 via COL6A1, with the levels of expression of P4HA1, COL6A1 and the vascular endothelial molecular markers CD31 showing positive correlations in vivo assay. Altering the expression of P4HA1 in GSCs altered the expression of COL6A1 and CD31, thereby inducing glioma angiogenesis. In conclusion, this study revealed that the P4HA1/COL6A1 axis modulates the transdifferentiation process of GSCs into ECs. Interrupting this signaling axis can inhibit glioma angiogenesis, suggesting that this axis may be a novel target for antivascular therapy in patients with glioma.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2870610b63b921de114f5b788ff65b9b79d6440

When the maxillary incisor display is correct, maxillary incisor intrusion is unnecessary; treatment should involve intrusion and leveling of the mandibular anterior teeth to avoid flattening of the smile arc. 2 Any maxillary incisor intrusion or mandibular leveling should be carefully monitored during treatment to maintain proper incisor exposure while effectively correcting the deep bite. After the development of thermoformed appliances that could be used for minor tooth movements, 3-7 the Invisalign* system was introduced for treatment of moderate malocclusions. 8-13 In 2004, Wheeler reported that Invisalign could be used in patients with anterior and posterior crossbites, deep bites, anterior open bites or shallow overbites, and periodontal problems. 14 The present article describes the use of Invisalign appliances for the correction of deep bite in adult patients with normal skeletal patterns. Case 1 A 23-year-old female presented with a Class I malocclusion, a deep bite, and mild crowding in both arches (Fig. 1). Treatment involved 23 upper and 29 lower aligners. After 15 months of initial treatment, another six months of Case Refinement was needed to finish the lower alignment (Figs. 2,3). The upper and lower crowding was corrected with interproximal reduction. The deep bite was opened by leveling the mandibular arch, using controlled proclination of the mandibular incisors and only slight intrusion of the maxillary incisors, thus maintaining the smile arc. The patient’s good posterior occlusal relationship was preserved.;Yes;Yes;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae8a564c016cc39d2d87030c28a1e85e67fb7a4a

They did not consider trials involving surgical or other simultaneous fixed or removable orthodontic treatment interventions., , , RESULTS, The authors searched electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, EMBASE Excerpta Medica, Thomsen's ISI Web of Science and LILACS) with the help of a senior health sciences librarian. They used "Invisalign" as the sole search term, and 22 documents appeared in the combined search. Thereafter, they used "clinical trials," "humans" and "Invisalign treatment effects" as abstract selection criteria. Only two published articles met these inclusion criteria, though after reading the actual articles, the authors determined that they did not adequately evaluate Invisalign treatment effects. Both articles identified methodological issues., , , CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS, The inadequately designed studies the authors found represented only a lower level of evidence (level II). Therefore, the authors found that no strong conclusions could be made regarding the treatment effects of Invisalign appliances. Future prospective randomized clinical trials are required to support, with sound scientific evidence, the claims about Invisalign's treatment effects. Clinicians will have to rely on their Invisalign clinical experience, the opinions of experts and the limited published evidence when using Invisalign appliances.;Yes;Yes;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b91cc971d48da6c0af03d33437a93a203a291e3

Enter after set sense see institution practice.;Poster;OBJECTIVES, To investigate in a numerical study the effect of the geometry and the extension of orthodontic aligner edges and the aligner thickness on force transmission to upper right central incisor tooth (Tooth 11)., , , METHODS, A three-dimensional (3D) digital model, obtained from a 3D data set of a complete dentulous maxilla, was imported into 3-matic software. Aligners with four different trimming line designs (scalloped, straight, scalloped extended, straight extended) were designed, each with four different thicknesses (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mm). The models were exported to a finite element (FE) software (Marc/Mentat). A facial 0.2 mm bodily malposition of tooth 11 was simulated., , , RESULTS, The maximum resultant force was in the range of (7.5 - 55.2) N. The straight trimming designs had higher resultant force than the scalloped designs. The resultant force increases with increasing the edge extension of the aligner. The normal contact forces were unevenly distributed over the entire surface and were concentrated in six areas: Incisal, Mesio-Incisal, Disto-Incisal, Middle, Mesio-Cervical, and Disto-Cervical. The resultant force increases super linearly with increasing thickness., , , CONCLUSIONS, The design of the trimming line, the edge extension, and the thickness of the aligner affect significantly the magnitude of the resultant force and the distribution of normal contact force. The straight extended trimming design exhibited better force distribution that may favor a bodily tooth movement., , , CLINICAL RELEVANCE, A straight extended trimming design of an orthodontic aligner may improve the clinical outcomes. In addition, the manufacturing procedures of the straight design are much simpler compared to the scalloped design.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eacc04c1f0d8b4e95b3d100abc41d2fbd50e76b8

We described a method for isolating the human endothelial cells from the human thoracic aorta. Methods: Normal aortic samples were prepared from subjects with brain death in Masih Daneshvari Hospital. The endothelial cells were isolated using collagenase and were evaluated by the measurement of CD31 marker. Furthermore, the digestion efficacy was studied by vessel histological analysis, and the adhesion mechanism was investigated by leukocyte endothelial adhesion assay kit.

In order to assess intratumoral vascularization and the efficiency of blood flow in locally advanced gastric cancer, we examined 57 patients through pCLE imaging. The vascular alterations in gastric cancer were mainly characterized by leakage and by the presence of tortuous and large size vessels. Defects in blood flow were detected very rarely. No association between the angiogenic score and the gastric tumor site or histological type was observed. Interestingly, no correlation was also found with the tumor grading indicating that the vascular angiogenic anomalies in gastric cancer represent an early pathological event to be observed and detected. The majority of patients displayed unchanged vascular alterations following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and this positively correlated with stable or progressive disease, suggesting that an unaltered angiogenic score could per se be indicative of poor therapeutic efficacy. Different vascular parameters were evaluated by immunofluorescence using bioptic samples and the vessel density did not correlate with clinical staging, site or histologic type. Interestingly, only CD105, Multimerin-2 and GLUT1 were able to discriminate normal from tumoral gastric mucosa. Taken together, these findings indicate that functional and structural angiogenic parameters characteristic of tumor blood network were fully detectable by pCLE. Moreover, the evaluation of tumor vasculature by real-time assessment may provide useful information to achieve tailored therapeutic interventions for gastric cancer patients.;No;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4431f4ed21ea0985817d26a08f4747bcb5381f5e

Serve keep truth president. Friend great agent real change.;ShortPaper;Abstract Introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the therapy of patients with coronary artery disease resulted in the significant reduction of in-stent restenosis compared to bare-metal stent (BMS) treatment. However, the high incidence of late stent thrombosis with DES emerged as one of the safety concerns after their implantation. Enhancing stent endothelization by improved early healing and neointimal strut coverage emerged as possible solution for this late complication. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) capturing stents are designed to promote in situ endothelization with immobilized, antihuman, anti-CD34 antibodies attached to the luminal stent surface. Anti-CD34 antibodies target and capture EPC from circulation, which further differentiate into vascular endothelial cells and form functional endothelial layer on the stent surface. These cells are also capable of secreting pro-angiogenic factors that stimulate local endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate. Preclinical and clinical studies proved feasibility, efficacy and safety of EPC capturing stents in stable and high-risk patients with coronary artery disease. Rapid and extensive endothelization of EPC capturing stents translated into favorable profile of clinical outcomes, comparable to efficacy of BMSs and DESs. Therefore, we here present the most important results from the experimental and clinical studies that explored ECP capturing strategy to enhance endothelization, reduce the incidence of instent thrombosis and improve outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease, along with the future perspectives in this promising therapeutic approach.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4f2a64c10c58e31d3634d0880b7b7b0419f7d61

Sell unit side full take into member.;Poster;Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMVECs) line the vascular system of the brain and are the chief cells in the formation and function of the blood brain barrier (BBB). These cells are heterogeneous along the cerebral vasculature and any dysfunctional state in these cells can result in a local loss of function of the BBB in any region of the brain. There is currently no report on the distribution and variation of the CMVECs in different brain regions in humans. This study investigated microcirculation in the adult human brain by the characterization of the expression pattern of brain endothelial cell markers in different brain regions. Five different brain regions consisting of the visual cortex, the hippocampus, the precentral gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, and the rhinal cortex obtained from three normal adult human brain specimens were studied and analyzed for the expression of the endothelial cell markers: cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and von-Willebrand-Factor (vWF) through immunohistochemistry. We observed differences in the expression pattern of CD31 and vWF between the gray matter and the white matter in the brain regions. Furthermore, there were also regional variations in the pattern of expression of the endothelial cell biomarkers. Thus, this suggests differences in the nature of vascularization in various regions of the human brain. These observations also suggest the existence of variation in structure and function of different brain regions, which could reflect in the pathophysiological outcomes in a diseased state.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc905346a3a6e9012d9d63ef4ebc595fa4db101e

Under likely ever ever whatever direction never.;FullPaper;The objective of the present study is to describe the stress and displacement patterns created by clear aligners and composite attachments bonded with the acid-etch technique on the labial surface of the maxillary first upper molar during its distalization. Maxillary molar distalization is a clinical orthodontics procedure used to move the first maxillary molar distally. The procedure is useful in patients with some Class II malocclusion allowing the first molar to move into a Class I relationship and the correction of associated malocclusion features. Three finite element models were designed to simulate the alveolar bone, molar tooth, periodontal ligament, aligner, and composite attachments. The first model had no composite attachment, the second model had a vertical rectangular attachment, and the third model had a newly designed attachment. A loading method was developed that mimicked the aligner's molar distal movement. PDL was set as a viscoelastic material with a nonlinear mechanical response. von Mises and maximum principal stresses and tooth displacement patterns were analyzed using dedicated software. All the configurations showed some form of clockwise rotation in addition to the distal movement. The crown portion of the tooth showed maximum displacement in all three models; however, in the absence of attachment, the root apex moved in the opposite direction which was compatible with uncontrolled tipping movement. Simulations with attachments exhibited the best performance regarding the movement patterns. The third group, with the newly designed attachment, exhibited the best performance concerning stress distribution (principal stress and von Mises stresses) and higher stresses in the periodontal ligament and tooth. Incorporating a vertical rectangular attachment in a clear aligner resulted in the reduction of mesiodistal tipping tendency during molar distalization. The third model was the most efficient considering both displacement pattern and stress distribution. The level of stress generated by the third model needs to be further investigated in future studies.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dfbdb95d2f3aea290eac61a63cb855946b8cb09

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of apela in post‐myocardial infarction (post‐MI) recovery from cardiorenal damage. A murine MI model was established, and apela was then infused subcutaneously for two weeks. Echocardiographs were performed before and after infarction at the indicated times. Renal function was evaluated by serum and urine biochemistry. Immunohistochemistry of heart and kidney tissue was performed by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‐mediated dUPT nick end‐labelling reaction. Compared to the control group (MI/vehicle), the average value of the left ventricular ejection fraction in apela‐treated mice increased by 32% and 39% at 2‐ and 4‐week post‐MI, respectively. The mean levels of serum blood urea nitrogen，creatinine, N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide and 24‐hour urine protein were significantly decreased at 4‐week post‐MI in apela‐treated mice relative to that of control animals. At the cellular level, we found that apela treatment significantly reduced myocardial fibrosis and cellular apoptosis in heart and kidney tissue. These data suggest that apela improves cardiac and renal function in mice with acute MI.

In the second and third models, thermoplastic aligner with horizontal ellipsoid composite attachment and power ridge were used, respectively. The software used for the study was ANSYS 14.5 FE. A force of 100 g was applied to torque the upper right central incisor. The resultant force transfer, stress distribution, and tooth displacement were evaluated. Results: The overall tooth displacement and stress distribution appeared high in the model with power ridge, whereas the root movement was more in the horizontal ellipsoid composite attachment model.

Materials and Methods A full maxillary arch (14 teeth) was modelled by combining two different imaging techniques: cone beam computed tomography and surface-structured light scan. The appliance and auxiliary element geometries were created by exploiting computer-aided design (CAD) procedures. The reconstructed digital models were imported within the finite element solver (Ansys® 17). For the extrusion movement, the authors compared the aligner without an attachment with three auxiliary-aligner designs: a rectangular palatal attachment, a rectangular buccal attachment, and an ellipsoid buccal attachment. The resulting force-moment (MF) system delivered by the aligner to the target tooth and the tooth displacement were calculated for each scenario. Results The maximum tooth displacement along the z-axis (0.07 mm) was obtained with the rectangular palatal attachment, while the minimum (0.02 mm) was obtained without any attachments. With the ellipsoid attachment, the highest undesired moments Mx and My were found. The rectangular palatal attachment showed the highest Fz (2.0 N) with the lowest undesired forces (Fx = 0.4 N; Fy = −0.2 N). Conclusions FEA demonstrated that the rectangular palatal attachment can improve the effectiveness of the appliance for the extrusion of an upper central incisor.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f97896f3d198b154c175041272ea149e32ee450

Ground movie speech stock.;DemoPaper;Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic factor sensed by most cells. It regulates a broad spectrum of cellular responses including hematopoiesis. In order to process TGF-β1-responses in time and space in an appropriate manner, there is a tight regulation of its signaling at diverse steps. The downstream signaling is mediated by type I and type II receptors and modulated by the ‘accessory’ receptor Endoglin also termed cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105). Endoglin was initially identified on pre-B leukemia cells but has received most attention due to its high expression on activated endothelial cells. In turn, Endoglin has been figured out as the causative factor for diseases associated with vascular dysfunction like hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-1 (HHT-1), pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUPR). Because HHT patients often show signs of inflammation at vascular lesions, and loss of Endoglin in the myeloid lineage leads to spontaneous inflammation, it is speculated that Endoglin impacts inflammatory processes. In line, Endoglin is expressed on progenitor/precursor cells during hematopoiesis as well as on mature, differentiated cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, so far only pro-monocytes and macrophages have been in the focus of research, although Endoglin has been identified in many other immune system cell subsets. These findings imply a functional role of Endoglin in the maturation and function of immune cells. Aside the functional relevance of Endoglin in endothelial cells, CD105 is differentially expressed during hematopoiesis, arguing for a role of this receptor in the development of individual cell lineages. In addition, Endoglin expression is present on mature immune cells of the innate (i.e., macrophages and mast cells) and the adaptive (i.e., T-cells) immune system, further suggesting Endoglin as a factor that shapes immune responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on Endoglin expression and function in hematopoietic precursors and mature hematopoietic cells of different lineages.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f615ebcd56c54ac92dbe6b50333334b8dcc37d85

Methods A three-dimensional model of the maxillary bone, maxillary right central incisor, lateral incisor and canine was designed based on the average dimensions of the anatomy and morphology given by Wheeler’s and standard edgewise bracket with Slot of 0.022″ X 0.028″ inch was designed using the finite element method. Brackets were placed on each tooth, on the mentioned labial surface at variable distances from the cusp tip, and a full size archwire was virtually engaged into the bracket, then optimum orthodontic load of 2N is applied and PDL stress were calculated. Results The lowest stress values were measured as bracket position changes from crest of teeth to the apical direction. By displacing the bracket gingivally from 1.5 to 6 mm, a 16.2% decrease in stress level for central incisor, for lateral incisor the stress level decrease by 25.8% and for canine the stress level decrease by 21.6% thus our study confirms that variation in vertical bracket position results in change in resultant stress in PDL.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the various archwire characteristics like the friction coebetween bracket and archwire, the cross-section shape, and the cross-section dimension, on the displacement and the periodontal ligament (PDL) stresses of canine’s movement in a self-ligating treatment using the finite element (FE) analysis method. METHODS: Models of teeth and their supporting tissues, brackets and archwires were constructed. Ten kinds of archwires were used for the simulation. RESULTS: Considering the translation movement, the maximum displacement, highest stress, and Rc⁢r increased with an increase in the cross-section area. The maximum displacement and highest stress increased with an increase in the friction coefficient. The Rc⁢r values increased with an increase in the friction coefficient in the round archwires, while decreased with an increase in the rectangular archwires. However, these change tends were different in rotation and inclination movement. CONCLUSION: The archwire characteristics (round archwire, rectangular archwire, cross-section area, and friction coefficient) exhibited different effects on the tooth translation, rotation, and inclination.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate a methodology for quantitatively evaluating OTP, using theoretical analyses, orthodontic forces measurement (OFM) and finite element method (FEM). METHODS: An OTP was theoretically designed based on a clinical case and forces on incisors in OTP were measured on a specialized platform. Further, FEM simulations were performed on the designed OTP and control group. At last, an 18-month tracking was carried out to observe treatment effects of the designed OTP. RESULTS: The moving tendencies of incisors were in keeping with ideal treatment from the designed OTP through FEM; the maximal hydrostatic stress and logarithmic strain in periodontal ligament (PDL) decreased by 26.81% and 32.60% compared to the control group. Clinical feedback indicated that a controllable correction of incisors was realized after 18 months, which was in accord with the FEM result and root/bone resorption by reason of stress/strain reduction on PDL did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanical responses of periodontium can be quantitatively estimated using OTM and FEM.

However, some types of tooth movement, such as extrusion, are difficult with this tool. Therefore, composite attachments have been suggested to improve tooth movement. This study aims to evaluate the initial displacement and stress distribution during upper central incisor extrusion using the conventional composite attachments. Maxillary models with the upper teeth, clear aligners, and composite attachments placed on the labial surface of the upper right central incisor were constructed. Four models were created to simulate upper central incisor extrusion: (1) without any composite attachment; (2) rectangular beveled attachment; (3) ellipsoid attachment; and (4) horizontal rectangular attachment. Clear aligners were designed to perform upper central incisor extrusion. The constructed models were analyzed using the finite element method. Initial displacement and stress distribution were analyzed. Output analysis found that the upper right central incisor in the model with a horizontal rectangular attachment had the greatest extrusive movement, followed by the model with ellipsoid attachment and the model with beveled attachment. Maximum compressive stress was seen at the cervical region of the composite attachment. Composite attachments including horizontal rectangular attachment, ellipsoid attachment, and rectangular beveled attachment can be used to perform upper central incisor extrusion.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e15af01d735e9e2ed4f3e4768e58803574662de9

Although aligners have undergone considerable improvements over time, to date they have limitations in resolving the most serious malocclusions related to transverse maxillary deficiency. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate an orthodontic protocol (the Nuvola® OP System) which associates a morpho-functional corrector (to be used for 30 min/day) with the aligner, allowing for the treatment of cases that would be difficult or unpredictable with aligners alone. Methods: Linear measurements were taken on STL files of 100 patients. In 77 patients between 18 and 55 years (mean 28.6 ± 16.2 (standard deviation) years), 3D superimpositions of the maxilla obtained from intraoral scans before and after treatment were performed in order to evaluate the degree of maxillary expansion. The normality of the data distribution was tested. The pre- and post-treatment data were compared using a paired t-test with a 5% significance level. After treatment, a questionnaire was proposed to assess patients’ degree of satisfaction and compliance. Results: A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) for each distance evaluated was found. The maximum expansion was obtained at the first molar level (2.35 ± 1.64 mm). Of the subjects who completed the questionnaire, 96% were satisfied and 90% were able to perform the protocol without difficulty for the required duration. Conclusions: A significant expansion of the maxillary arch as well as a high degree of patient satisfaction and compliance were observed with the Nuvola® OP System. Further studies are needed in order to clinically evaluate the relative contribution of the aligners and morpho-functional device to the obtained expansion.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7330a0a8e1f05a95456a7d9fcd5615d6b6db87df

However, to date, none of the available techniques and/or endothelial markers employed to assess angiogenesis in the implant/host interface seems to be able to highlight vascular structures convincingly. In the present study we investigated and compared the expression of two endothelial cell markers: platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) (CD31) and endoglin (CD105) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) to identify and quantify newly formed blood vessels in subcutaneous implants of polyether-polyurethane sponge of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. At day 14 post implantation the discs of the synthetic matrix were removed and processed for histological and morphometric analysis. In IHC staining for CD31 antibody the number of vessels was 2.27±0.69 and 5.25±0.46 for CD105. In IF for CD31 the number of vessels was 15.36±1.295 and 10.54±0.8213 for CD105. The level of cross-reaction was lesser in IF images compared with IHC images. Co-localization of CD31/CD105 using confocal images showed positive correlation (Pearson's co-relation and Manders' equation). The double labeling for blood vessels using the IF technique for CD31/CD105 may be an important tool for evaluation of angiogenesis in biomaterial/host integration.;No;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/729c6d1407dd39e62d7fa3a1b3219616fdd6fb77

(2) Methods: Fifteen patients who underwent orthodontic treatment using directly printed clear aligners were recruited. The study sample included 12 maxillary and 10 mandibular arches, whose pre-treatment, predicted and post-treatment digital models were superimposed on the untreated posterior teeth by means of a best-fit surface-based registration, which was also used to transfer three anatomical landmarks, digitally labeled on the crown of each anterior moving tooth, from the pre-treatment to the predicted and post-treatment models. The Teeth Alignment Performance (TAP) index, quantifying how close the final landmarks were to their expected final position, was proposed as an accuracy index of both individual tooth and group of teeth movement, and its inter-examiner repeatability was tested. (3) Results: No systematic inter-rater discrepancy associated with TAP was observed (p > 0.05), not even when a slight systematic inter-rater difference in landmark labelling was detected (for the upper central incisors, p < 0.001). In addition, all Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values showed excellent inter-rater agreement (>0.95), and the small Random Error of Measurement (REM), ranging from 1% for the arch TAP to 3% for the lower canine TAP, indicated that this accuracy index is highly repeatable. (4) Conclusions: The TAP index was proven to be comprehensive, consistent and reliable in assessing the performance of teeth alignment according to a digital plan. The proposed method is also suitable to be implemented in the clinical digital workflow.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2d0e0bd78e29b8497873436e5e8414451b2fb60

One of its forms, soluble endoglin (sEng), a molecule with antiangiogenic properties, has been found overexpressed in patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and is proposed as a marker of endothelial damage. Accordingly, we aimed to quantify the efficacy of various antihypertensive regimens on sEng levels, in hypertensive patients with endothelial dysfunction. Patients and methods: 323 patients were enrolled, and there were 99 patients with normal blood pressure values, 106 hypertensive patients under chronic treatment with different types of antihypertensive molecules (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics) in monotherapy, and 118 hypertensive patients under chronic treatment with perindopril. sEng plasma levels were quantified and were correlated with classical methods of assessing the endothelial damage. Results: Patients under chronic treatment with perindopril had lower sEng plasma levels compared with the other group of hypertensive patients under different regimens of antihypertensive treatment (sEng: 4.73±1.39 versus 5.63±2.33, p<0.01). Conclusion: Decreased sEng plasma levels were found in patients under chronic treatment with perindopril, when compared with other antihypertensive regimens of treatment (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or diuretics).;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ad5cb5c3f23e979478da6ec977e0eb8095caabe

However, limitations exist for aligner technology, such as corrections involving complex force systems. Composite attachments on the tooth surface are intended to enable active control of tooth movements. However, unintended tooth movements still occur. In this study, we present an effective attachment design of an attachment that can efficiently induce tooth movement by comparing and analyzing the movement and rotation of teeth between a general attachment and an overhanging attachment. The 3D finite element modes were constructed from CBCT data and used to analyze the distal displacement of the central incisor using 0.5- and 0.75-mm-thick aligners without an attachment, and with general and overhanging attachments. The results show that the aligner with the overhanging attachment can effectively reduce crown tipping and prevent axial rotation for an intended distal displacement of the central incisor. In all models, an aligner with or without attachments was not capable of preventing the lingual inclination of the tooth.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b2896298613971768ebf1aef6e379cf7ec043cc

Data sources: Seven databases of published and unpublished literature were searched up to 4 August 2020 for eligible studies. Data selection: Studies were deemed eligible if they included evaluation of rotational tooth movement with any type of aligner, through the comparison of software-based and actually achieved data after patient treatment. Data extraction and data synthesis: Data extraction was done independently and in duplicate and risk of bias assessment was performed with the use of the QUADAS-2 tool. Random effects meta-analyses with effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed and the quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE. Results: Seven articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, of which three contributed to meta-analyses. Overall results revealed a non-accurate prediction of the outcome for the software-based data, irrespective of the use of attachments or interproximal enamel reduction (IPR). Maxillary canines demonstrated the lowest percentage accuracy for rotational tooth movement (three studies: effect size = 47.9%; 95% CI = 27.2–69.5; P < 0.001), although high levels of heterogeneity were identified (I2: 86.9%; P < 0.001). Contrary, mandibular incisors presented the highest percentage accuracy for predicted rotational movement (two studies: effect size = 70.7%; 95% CI = 58.9–82.5; P < 0.001; I2: 0.0%; P = 0.48). Risk of bias was unclear to low overall, while quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. Conclusion: Allowing for all identified caveats, prediction of rotational tooth movements with aligner treatment does not appear accurate, especially for canines.

Rather get subject result sense.;Poster;With an increase in the application of ultra-wideband (UWB) electromagnetic pulses in the communications industry, radar, biotechnology and medicine, comes an interest in UWB exposure safety standards. Despite an increase of the scientific research on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses, characterization of those effects is far from complete. A numerical computational approach, such as a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method, is required to visualize and understand the complexity of broadband electromagnetic interactions. The FDTD method has almost no limits in the description of the geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated material, it is numerically robust and appropriate for current computer technology. In this paper, a complete calculation of exposure of the human eye to UWB electromagnetic pulses in the frequency range of 3.1–10.6, 22–29 and 57–64 GHz is performed. Computation in this frequency range required a geometrical resolution of the eye of 0.1 mm and an arbitrary precision in the description of its dielectric properties in terms of the Debye model. New results show that the interaction of UWB pulses with the eye tissues exhibits the same properties as the interaction of the continuous electromagnetic waves (CWs) with the frequencies from the pulse's frequency spectrum. It is also shown that under the same exposure conditions the exposure to UWB pulses is from one to many orders of magnitude safer than the exposure to CW.;Yes;No;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0310a7e04e326ee55d77d67f535d5bb33deab01

Although there is substantial prior literature on the biological effects of UWB pulses on both cells and animals, an explicit, unequivocal and definite pattern of the corresponding biological responses remains elusive, and the systemic secondary consequences are also still not fully understood. In this study, we found that exposing mice to UWB pulses resulted in the alteration of several biochemical blood parameters, which further prompted us to investigate changes in the liver and kidneys of mice exposed to UWB pulses with different field intensities and different durations. The data demonstrated that exposure to UWB pulses significantly increased the levels of ALT and AST, increased oxidative stress, and could even induce the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. The total number of pulses under the tested acute exposure regiment contributed most to the observed hepatic and rental dysfunction. Notably, the physiological and molecular changes recovered approximately 72 hours after exposure. These results imply the potential risk of acute exposure to UWB pulses, and highlight the meaningful targets for further long-term study of chronic exposure.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/390ffd3cebdda95bac61581b7a953797cc9b3fd0

The repetition rate was 100 pps, and the duration of train pulses lasted from 10 s to twice 8 min. The effects were studied on the central nervous system, by labelling brain inflammation marker GFAP and by performing different behavioural tests: rotarod, T-maze, beam-walking, open-field, and avoidance test. Long-time survival was measured in animals repeatedly exposed, and anatomopathological analysis was performed on animals sacrificed at two years of life or at death if earlier. One group was sham exposed. Few effects were observed on behaviour. With acute exposure, an avoidance reflex was shown at very high, thermal level (22 W/kg); GFAP was increased some days after exposure. Most importantly, with repeated exposures, survival time was 4-month shorter in the exposed group, with eleven animals exhibiting a large sub-cutaneous tumour, compared to two in the sham group. A residual X-ray exposure was also present in the beam (0.8 Gy), which is not a bias for the observed result. High power microwaves below thermal level in average, can increase cancer incidence and decrease survival time in rats, without clear effects on behaviour. The parameters of this effect need to be explored further, and a more precise dosimetry to be performed.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b320dfa723ea319bba41530e956fae616f40c01d

The differences between actual treatment outcome and predicted outcome were computed and tested for statistical significance for each tooth type in mesial-distal, facial-lingual, and occlusal-gingival directions, as well as for tip, torque, and rotation. Differences larger than 0.5 mm for linear measurements and 2° for angular measurements were considered clinically relevant., , , RESULTS, Statistically significant differences (P < .05) between predicted and achieved tooth positions were found for all teeth except maxillary lateral incisors, canines, and first premolars. In general, anterior teeth were positioned more occlusally than predicted, rotation of rounded teeth was incomplete, and movement of posterior teeth in all dimensions was not fully achieved. However, except for excess posttreatment facial crown torque of maxillary second molars, these differences were not large enough to be clinically relevant., , , CONCLUSIONS, Although Invisalign is generally able to achieve predicted tooth positions with high accuracy in nonextraction cases, some of the actual outcomes may differ from the predicted outcomes. Knowledge of dimensions in which the final tooth position is less consistent with the predicted position enables clinicians to build necessary compensations into the virtual treatment plan.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b3dbd1a6969527e7de286ba8cb8884e3e9079d2

However, implant monitoring systems are limited by lack of tissue biocompatibility. Here, we developed an implantable ECG sensor for real-time monitoring of ventricular fibrillation and evaluated its biocompatibility using an animal model. The implantable sensor comprised transplant sensors with two electrodes, a wireless power transmission system, and a monitoring system. The sensor was inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal area and operated for 1 h/day for 5 days using a wireless power system. Importantly, the sensor was encapsulated by subcutaneous tissue and induced angiogenesis, inflammation, and phagocytosis. In addition, we observed that the levels of inflammation-related markers increased with wireless-powered transmission via the ECG sensor; in particular, levels of the Th-1 cytokine interleukin-12 were significantly increased. The results showed that induced tissue damage was associated with the use of wireless-powered sensors. We also investigated research strategies for the prevention of adverse effects caused by lack of tissue biocompatibility of a wireless-powered ECG monitoring system and provided information on the clinical applications of inflammatory reactions in implant treatment using the wireless-powered transmission system.;No;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f706418ed99329f1fbe3aeb90e55283494590f7f

In general, case confidence increased with increasing experience for both orthodontists and general dentists. After adjusting for experience, there was a significant difference in aligner case confidence between orthodontists and general dentists for several malocclusions. General dentists were more confident than orthodontists in treating deep bite, severe crowding, and Class II malocclusions with aligners (P ≤ .0001). Significant differences were also found for all treatment management techniques except interproximal reduction., , , CONCLUSION, There was a significant difference in case selection, treatment management, and aligner expertise between orthodontists and general dentists, although the differences in case selection were small.

Rest vote drive contain need program.;ShortPaper;A high-power ultrawideband radiation source has been developed which is capable of synthesizing electromagnetic pulses with different frequency bands in free space. To this end, a new circuit design comprising a four-channel former of bipolar pulses of durations 2 and 3 ns has been elaborated and conditions for the stable operation of gas gaps of independent channels without external control pulses have been determined. Each element of the 2 × 2 array of combined antennas is driven from an individual channel of the pulse former. Antennas excited by pulses of the same duration are arranged diagonally. Two radiation synthesis modes have been examined: one aimed to attain ultimate field strength and the other aimed to attain an ultimate width of the radiation spectrum. The modes were changed by changing the time delay between the 2-ns and 3-ns pulses. For the first mode, radiation pulses with a frequency band of 0.2-0.8 GHz and an effective potential of 500 kV have been obtained. The synthesized radiation pulses produced in the second mode had an extended frequency band (0.1-1 GHz) and an effective potential of 220 kV.

Pre- and posttreatment digital models created from an iTero scan were obtained from a single orthodontist practitioner. Digital models from Clincheck were also obtained from Align Technology. Linear values of upper and lower arch widths were measured for canines, premolars, and first molars at two different points: lingual gingival margins and cusp tips. A paired t-test was used to compare expansion planned on Clincheck with the posttreatment measurements. Variance ratio tests were used to determine if a larger change planned was associated with larger error., , , RESULTS, For every maxillary measurement, there was a statistically significant difference between Clincheck and final outcome (P < .05), with prediction worsening toward the posterior region of the arch. For the lower arch measurements at the gingival margin, there was a statistically significant difference between the Clincheck planned expansion and the final outcome (P < .05). Points measured at the cusp tips of the lower arch teeth showed nonstatistically significant differences between Clincheck prediction and the final outcome (P > .05). Variance ratios for upper and lower arches were significant (P < .05)., , , CONCLUSIONS, The mean accuracy of expansion planned with Invisalign for the maxilla was 72.8%. The lower arch presented an overall accuracy of 87.7%. Clincheck overestimates expansion by body movement; more tipping is observed.

Vote career interest defense however west adult., Kid could help lose.;DemoPaper;It has been suggested that the wireless network evolution to smaller carrier wavelengths (from 2G to 5G) increases radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) absorption in western honey bees (Apis mellifera). It is unknown whether the radiation performance of antennas is stable when an insect appears in their vicinity. In this research, the absorbed power in a worker honey bee and the influence of the bee’s presence on antennas’ radiation performance are investigated for the newly used frequencies in 5G networks from 6 to 240 GHz. To these aims, numerical simulations using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method were performed, in which a bee model, obtained by micro-CT scanning, was employed. These simulations showed that, in the near field, the absorbed power can increase by a factor of 53 from 6 to 240 GHz. This is a factor of 7 higher than the increase reported in the far-field in previous studies. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that antennas’ radiation efficiency can decrease by up to −40% when a bee appears in the near field. Likewise, it was found that the gain pattern depends on the separation distance between the bee and the antenna with a stronger dependency for higher frequencies.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cff7cddb8516987a40ae46f3b7a29f33de32d642

Look account land force bring edge., Market dog cell reveal. Nature deal summer.;Poster;This paper presents a novel approach to design compact wearable antennas based on metasurfaces. The behavior of compact metasurfaces is modeled with a composite right-left handed transmission line (CRLH TL). By controlling the dispersion curve, the resonant modes of the compact metasurface can be tuned efficiently. A printed coplanar waveguide (CPW) monopole antenna is used as the feed structure to excite the compact metasurface, which will result in a low profile antenna with low backward radiation. Following this approach, two compact antennas are designed for wearable applications. The first antenna is designed to operate at its first negative mode (−1 mode), which can realize miniaturization, but maintain the broadside radiation as for a normal microstrip antenna. The proposed prototype resonates around 2.65 GHz, with a matching bandwidth of 300 MHz. The total dimensions of the antenna are 39.4 × 33.4 mm2 (0.1 λ02), and its maximum gain is 2.99 dBi. The second antenna targets dual-band operation at 2.45 and 3.65 GHz. A pair of symmetric modes (±1 modes) are used to generate similar radiation patterns in these two bands. The size of the antenna is 55.79 × 52.25 mm2 (0.2 λ02), and the maximum gains are 4.25 and 7.35 dBi in the two bands, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the antennas is analyzed on the human body. The results show that the proposed antennas are promising candidates for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN).;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a50541e744b45ca5da9c44fb6fe8a883ecb2abcd

Family ago likely conference.;Poster;OBJECTIVE, To investigate changes in mandibular incisor position resulting from Invisalign correction of the crowded dentition without extraction., , , MATERIALS AND METHODS, A retrospective chart review was completed on 61 adult White patients. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the value of pretreatment crowding of the lower dentition: 20 mild (2.0-3.9 mm), 22 moderate (4.0-5.9 mm), and 19 severe (>6.0 mm). Cephalometric radiographs were measured to determine lower incisor changes. Interproximal reduction and changes in arch width were also measured. Statistical evaluation of T0 and T1 values using paired t-tests and analysis of covariance were applied to evaluate mean value changes., , , RESULTS, Lower incisor position and angulation changes were statistically significant in the severe crowding group. There were no statistically significant differences in lower incisor position between the mild and moderate crowding groups. There was a statistically significant increase in buccal expansion in each of the three groups., , , CONCLUSIONS, Invisalign(®) treatment can successfully resolve mandibular arch crowding using a combination of buccal arch expansion, interproximal reduction, and lower incisor proclination. When there is <6 mm of crowding, lower incisor position remained relatively stable.

Mandibular incisor proclination was measured by comparing pretreatment and near-end treatment lateral cephalograms. Eligibility criteria included adult patients with mild mandibular incisor crowding (<4 mm) and Class I skeletal bases (ANB, 1-4°). The main outcome was the cephalometric change in mandibular incisor inclination to the mandibular plane at the end of treatment. Eligible patients picking a sealed opaque envelope, which indicated their group allocation, was used to achieve randomization. Data was analyzed using a Welch two-sample t-test., , , RESULTS, Forty-four patients (mean age, 26.4 ± 7.7 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the fixed labial appliance or the clear aligner group. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups: Fixed appliance mean crowding was 2.1 ± 1.3 mm vs clear aligner mean crowding, 2.5 ± 1.3 mm; pretreatment mean mandibular incisor inclination for the fixed appliance group was 90.8 ± 5.4° vs 91.6 ± 6.4° for the clear aligner group. Fixed appliances produced 5.3 ± 4.3° of mandibular incisor proclination. Clear aligners proclined the mandibular incisors by 3.4 ± 3.2°.

Tell similar up hotel spring plan.;FullPaper;Objective: In this paper, we introduce global Maxwell tomography (GMT), a novel volumetric technique that estimates electric conductivity and permittivity by solving an inverse scattering problem based on magnetic resonance measurements. Methods: GMT relies on a fast volume integral equation solver, MARIE, for the forward path, and a novel regularization method, match regularization, designed specifically for electrical property estimation from noisy measurements. We performed simulations with three different tissue-mimicking numerical phantoms of different complexity, using synthetic transmit sensitivity maps with realistic noise levels as the measurements. We performed an experiment at 7 T using an eight-channel coil and a uniform phantom. Results: We showed that GMT could estimate relative permittivity and conductivity from noisy magnetic resonance measurements with an average error as low as 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, over the entire volume of the numerical phantom. Voxel resolution did not affect GMT performance and is currently limited only by the memory of the graphics processing unit. In the experiment, GMT could estimate electrical properties within 5% of the values measured with a dielectric probe. Conclusion: This work demonstrated the feasibility of GMT with match regularization, suggesting that it could be effective for accurate in vivo electrical property estimation. GMT does not rely on any symmetry assumption for the electromagnetic field, and can be generalized to estimate also the spin magnetization, at the expense of increased computational complexity. Significance: GMT could provide insight into the distribution of electromagnetic fields inside the body, which represents one of the key ongoing challenges for various diagnostic and therapeutic applications.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bec56822794dd5b878301ba3db1f84c723813536

Methodological shortcomings were highlighted and the quality of the studies was ranked using the Cochrane Tool for Risk of Bias Assessment., , , RESULTS, Eleven relevant articles were selected (two Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT), five prospective non-randomized, four retrospective non-randomized), and the risk of bias was moderate for six studies and unclear for the others. The amount of mean intrusion reported was 0.72 mm. Extrusion was the most difficult movement to control (30% of accuracy), followed by rotation. Upper molar distalization revealed the highest predictability (88%) when a bodily movement of at least 1.5 mm was prescribed. A decrease of the Little's Index (mandibular arch: 5 mm; maxillary arch: 4 mm) was observed in aligning arches., , , CONCLUSIONS, CAT aligns and levels the arches; it is effective in controlling anterior intrusion but not anterior extrusion; it is effective in controlling posterior buccolingual inclination but not anterior buccolingual inclination; it is effective in controlling upper molar bodily movements of about 1.5 mm; and it is not effective in controlling rotation of rounded teeth in particular.

Recently, computational human models generated from medical images have often been used for such assessment, especially to consider the inter-subject variability. However, a common procedure to develop personalized models is time consuming because it involves excessive segmentation of several components that represent different biological tissues, which is a major obstacle in the inter-subject variability assessment of radiation safety. Deep learning methods have been shown to be a powerful approach for pattern recognition and signal analysis. Convolutional neural networks with deep architecture are proven robust for feature extraction and image mapping in several biomedical applications. In this study, we develop a learning-based approach for fast and accurate estimation of the dielectric properties and density of tissues directly from magnetic resonance images in a single shot. The smooth distribution of the dielectric properties in head models, which is realized using a process without tissue segmentation, improves the smoothness of the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution compared with that in the commonly used procedure. The estimated SAR distributions, as well as that averaged over 10 g of tissue in a cubic shape, are found to be highly consistent with those computed using the conventional methods that employ segmentation.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14057ee94522c8b6e7fdae60d1dc3a3086897979

The posttreatment plaster models taken immediately after treatment were scanned and converted to stereolithography (STL) files; the ClinCheck models were also converted to STL format. MeshLab software was used to measure the seven components of the OGS, including alignment, marginal ridges, buccolingual inclinations, occlusal contacts, occlusal relationships, overjet and interproximal contacts. An overall OGS deduction score was also calculated., , , RESULTS, Compared with the posttreatment models, the ClinCheck models showed significantly (P  =  .016) fewer overall OGS point deductions (24 vs 15). These overall differences were due to significantly (P < .05) more deductions among the posttreatment models than the ClinCheck models for alignment (4.0 vs 1.0 deductions), buccolingual inclinations (4.0 vs 3.0 deductions), occlusal contacts (3.0 vs 2.0 deductions), and occlusal relations (4.0 vs 2.0 deductions)., , , CONCLUSION, The ClinCheck models do not accurately reflect the patients' final occlusion, as measured by the OGS, at the end of active treatment.;Yes;No;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34a44c3ee6cbb51ee1b679e9d8e4c3129685f388

Republican popular man offer tough cell future.;Poster;The accurate estimation of patient’s exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) significantly depends on a precise individual anatomical model. In the study, we investigated the applicability of an efficient whole-body individual modelling method for the assessment of MRI RF exposure. The individual modelling method included a deformable human model and tissue simplification techniques. Besides its remarkable efficiency, this approach utilized only a low specific absorption rate (SAR) sequence or even no MRI scan to generate the whole-body individual model. Therefore, it substantially reduced the risk of RF exposure. The dosimetric difference of the individual modelling method was evaluated using the manually segmented human models. In addition, stochastic dosimetry using a surrogate model by polynomial chaos presented SAR variability due to body misalignment and tilt in the coil, which were frequently occurred in the practical scan. In conclusion, the dosimetric equivalence of the individual models was validated by both deterministic and stochastic dosimetry. The proposed individual modelling method allowed the physicians to quantify the patient-specific SAR while the statistical results enabled them to comprehensively weigh over the exposure risk and get the benefit of imaging enhancement by using the high-intensity scanners or the high-SAR sequences.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b599af6462814e33074986785dcc3009e7d6586f

In the guidelines of the International Commission of Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, a reduction factor of 3 was considered to take into account numerical uncertainties when determining the limit values for human exposure. However, the rationale for this value is unsure. The IEEE International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety has published a research agenda to resolve numerical uncertainties in low-frequency dosimetry. For this purpose, intercomparison of results computed using different methods by different research groups is important. In previous intercomparison studies for low-frequency exposures, only a few computational methods were used, and the computational scenario was limited to a uniform magnetic field exposure. This study presents an application of various numerical techniques used: different finite-element method (FEM) schemes, method of moments, and boundary-element method (BEM) variants, and, finally, by using a hybrid FEM/BEM approach. As a computational example, the induced electric field in the brain by the coil used in transcranial magnetic stimulation is investigated. Intercomparison of the computational results is presented qualitatively.

Method: The ICVSIE is a system of integral equations in terms of volume and surface equivalent currents in biological tissue subject to fields produced by externally or internally positioned devices. The system is created by using equivalence principles and solved numerically; the resulting current values are used to evaluate scattered and total electric fields, specific absorption rates, and related quantities.

Phantom heads are routinely used for radiofrequency dosimetry simulations, and the purpose of this study was to construct averaged phantom heads for children and young adults. Using magnetic resonance images (MRI), sectioned cadaver images, and a hybrid approach, we initially built template phantoms representing 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-year-old children and young adults. Our subsequent approach revised the template phantoms using 29 averaged items that were identified by averaging the MRI data from 500 children and young adults. In females, the brain size and cranium thickness peaked in the early teens and then decreased. This is contrary to what was observed in males, where brain size and cranium thicknesses either plateaued or grew continuously. The overall shape of brains was spherical in children and became ellipsoidal by adulthood. In this study, we devised a method to build averaged phantom heads by constructing surface and voxel models. The surface model could be used for phantom manipulation, whereas the voxel model could be used for compliance test of specific absorption rate (SAR) for users of mobile phones or other electronic devices.;Yes;No;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74d3afe2ac8832c3e01dc289e72de6e4d4125927

On the one hand, excellent literature already exists on the practical aspect of risk management, with clinical workflow and recommendations. On the other hand, excellent technical articles also exist that explain these risks from basic principles of electromagnetism. We felt that an underserved niche might be found between the two, ie, somewhere between basic science and practical advice, to help develop intuition about electromagnetism that might prove of practical value when working around MR scanners.

Although qualitatively similar distributions of temperature increase have been obtained for both eye models, further analysis showed that the compound eye model is more suitable when the polarization of the incident EM wave is taken into account.

MRI, which relies on interactions between nuclear magnetic moments and the applied magnetic fields, uses a range of EM tools to optimize all of the magnetic fields required to produce the image. The main field magnet is designed to exacting specifications but challenges in manufacturing, installation, and use require additional tools to maintain target operational performance. The gradient magnetic fields, which provide the primary signal localization mechanism, are designed under another set of complex design trade‐offs which include conflicting imaging performance specifications and patient physiology. Gradients are largely impervious to external influences, but are also used to enhance main field operational performance. The radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields, which are used to elicit the signals fundamental to the MR image, are a challenge to optimize for a host of reasons that include patient safety, image quality, cost optimization, and secondary signal localization capabilities. This review outlines these issues and the EM modeling used to optimize MRI system performance.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f672f94a2924eeea8f9021b4a522c1dceaaff66a

President wait talk out others.;Poster;BACKGROUND, Human voxel models incorporating detailed anatomical features are vital tools for the computational evaluation of electromagnetic (EM) fields within the body. Besides whole-body human voxel models, phantoms representing smaller heterogeneous anatomical features are often employed; for example, localized breast voxel models incorporating fatty and fibroglandular tissues have been developed for a variety of EM applications including mammography simulation and dosimetry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultra-wideband microwave imaging. However, considering wavelength effects, electromagnetic modeling of the breast at sub-microwave frequencies necessitates detailed breast phantoms in conjunction with whole-body voxel models., , , METHODS, Heterogeneous breast phantoms are sized to fit within radiofrequency coil hardware, modified by voxel-wise extrusion, and fused to whole-body models using voxel-wise, tissue-dependent logical operators. To illustrate the utility of this method, finite-difference time-domain simulations are performed using a whole-body model integrated with a variety of available breast phantoms spanning the standard four tissue density classifications representing the majority of the population., , , RESULTS, The software library uses a combination of voxel operations to seamlessly size, modify, and fuse eleven breast phantoms to whole-body voxel models. The software is publicly available on GitHub and is linked to the file exchange at MATLAB® Central. Simulations confirm the proportions of fatty and fibroglandular tissues in breast phantoms have significant yet predictable implications on projected power deposition in tissue., , , CONCLUSIONS, Breast phantoms may be modified and fused to whole-body voxel models using the software presented in this work; user considerations for the open-source software and resultant phantoms are discussed. Furthermore, results indicate simulating breast models as predominantly fatty tissue can considerably underestimate the potential for tissue heating in women with substantial fibroglandular tissue.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2e432f885d9e522242dc26532709a70c1fc4263

Materials and methods: COMSOL Multiphysics® version 4.4 (Stockholm, Sweden), which is based on finite element methods (FEM), was used to design and simulate monopole and dual slot with sleeve antennas. Power, specific absorption rate (SAR), temperature and necrosis distributions in the selected tissues were determined using these antennas. Monopole and dual slot with sleeve antennas were designed, simulated, constructed and applied in this study based on a semi-rigid coaxial cable. Ex vivo experiments were performed on liver, lung, muscle and heart of bovine obtained from a public animal slaughter house. The microwave energy was delivered using a 2.45 GHz solid-state microwave generator at 40 W for 3, 5 and 10 min. Aspect ratio, ablation length and ablation diameter were also determined on ablated tissues and compared with simulated results. Student’s t-test was used to compare the statistically significant difference between the performance of the two antennas. Results: The dual slot antenna with sleeve produces localised microwave energy better than the monopole antenna in all ablated tissues using simulation and experimental validation methods. There were significant differences in ablation diameter and aspect ratio between the sleeve antenna and monopole antenna. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the simulation and experimental results. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the dual slot antenna with sleeve produced larger ablation zones and higher sphericity index in ex vivo bovine tissues with minimal backward heating when compared with the monopole antenna.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93ccafe9ab6228f6409b127c14bd7fe58f4c3c99

Although imaging techniques are available to detect subsurface BAT, there are currently no viable methods for continuous acquisition of BAT energy expenditure. Microwave (MW) radiometry is an emerging technology that allows the quantification of tissue temperature variations at depths of several centimeters. Such temperature differentials may be correlated with variations in metabolic rate, thus providing a quantitative approach to monitor BAT metabolism. In order to optimize MW radiometry, numerical and experimental phantoms with accurate dielectric properties are required to develop and calibrate radiometric sensors. Thus, we present for the first time, the characterization of relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues in rats across the MW range 0.5–10 GHz. Measurements were carried out in situ and post mortem in six female rats of approximately 200 g. A Cole–Cole model was used to fit the experimental data into a parametric model that describes the variation of dielectric properties as a function of frequency. Measurements confirm that the dielectric properties of BAT (εr = 14.0–19.4, σ = 0.3–3.3 S m−1) are significantly higher than those of WAT (εr = 9.1–11.9, σ = 0.1–1.9 S m−1), in accordance with the higher water content of BAT.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/becc25be56b3ba08e050a2d1bd510a74ea66ca92

The authors have conducted both instant and continuous measurements of high-frequency electromagnetic fields throughout their research by using non-ionising radiation-monitoring networks. Over 15,000 instant and 13,000,000 continuous measurements were taken throughout the process. The authors have found that the normal electric field radiation can increase ∼25% during daytime, depending on mobile communication traffic. The authors' research work has also demonstrated the fact that the electric field intensity values can be modelled for each hour, day or week with the results obtained from continuous measurements. The authors have developed an estimation model based on these values, including mobile communication traffic (Erlang) values obtained from mobile phone base stations and the temperature and humidity values in the environment.

Choice various conference better until form style say.;Poster;This paper, for the first time, fully characterizes the human body as a monopole antenna in the frequency range of 10-110 MHz, which contains the resonance frequency of the human body. The human body is represented by an equivalent cylindrical monopole antenna grounded on a highly conductive ground plane that is analyzed based on the three-term approximation method. The reflection coefficient is measured using a human subject as a monopole antenna. Measurement results show that the theoretical predictions are in reasonable agreement. It is found that the human body resonates between 40 and 60 MHz depending on the posture of the body when it is fed by a 50-Ω impedance system at the base of the foot. A minimum reflection coefficient of -12 dB is measured which demonstrates that the human body can be potentially used as an antenna. Theoretically, it is predicted that the human body can be an efficient antenna with a maximum radiation efficiency reaching up to 70%, which is supported by measurement results found in the literature.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84d6c3700b5274439b24f45333b9dead90971518

For far-field exposure, the power density at which the basic restriction for the whole body SAR is reached is calculated for both the mother and the fetus at whole body resonance and at frequencies between 450 MHz and 2,450 MHz. The near-field exposure is assessed at 450 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2,450 MHz using half wavelength dipoles as generic sources located at different locations around the abdomen of the mother. For the investigated cases, the exposure of the mother is always below or on the order of magnitude of the basic restriction for exposure at the reference level. When applying the reference levels for the general public, the fetus is sufficiently shielded by the mother. However, the basic restrictions for general public exposure can be exceeded in the fetus when the mother is exposed at reference levels for occupational conditions. For plane wave exposure at occupational levels, the whole body SAR in the fetus can exceed the basic restrictions for the general population by at least 1.8 dB, and in the near-field of professional devices, the 10 g SAR can be non-compliant with the product standard for the general public by > 3.5 dB.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20bc3212c08d2e8ae8d63db91c70eca1113fb0e6

Open focus by structure interesting imagine the.;DemoPaper;The electromagnetic absorption cross-section (ACS) averaged over polarization and angle-of-incidence of 60 ungrounded adult subjects was measured at microwave frequencies of 1–12 GHz in a reverberation chamber. Average ACS is important in non-ionizing dosimetry and exposure studies, and is closely related to the whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (WBSAR). The average ACS was measured with a statistical uncertainty of less than 3% and high frequency resolution for individuals with a range of body shapes and sizes allowing the statistical distribution of WBSAR over a real population with individual internal and external morphologies to be determined. The average ACS of all subjects was found to vary from 0.15 to 0.4 m2; for an individual subject it falls with frequency over 1–6 GHz, and then rises slowly over the 6–12 GHz range in which few other studies have been conducted. Average ACS and WBSAR are then used as a surrogate for worst-case ACS/WBSAR, in order to study their variability across a real population compared to literature results from simulations using numerical phantoms with a limited range of anatomies. Correlations with body morphological parameters such as height, mass and waist circumference have been investigated: the strongest correlation is with body surface area (BSA) at all frequencies above 1 GHz, however direct proportionality to BSA is not established until above 5 GHz. When the average ACS is normalized to the BSA, the resulting absorption efficiency shows a negative correlation with the estimated thickness of subcutaneous body fat. Surrogate models and statistical analysis of the measurement data are presented and compared to similar models from the literature. The overall dispersion of measured average WBSAR of the sample of the UK population studied is consistent with the dispersion of simulated worst-case WBSAR across multiple numerical phantom families. The statistical results obtained allow the calibration of human exposure assessments made with particular phantoms to a population with a range of individual morphologies.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/254e11494445f597158942a50a97170d4b4b2b50

Decide rock leave most laugh.;DemoPaper;This paper evaluates the variability of specific absorption rate (SAR) in the human eye. This variability results from changes in ocular axial length (OAL), which is common in many ophthalmologic and vision abnormalities, including myopia. A generic eye model was reconstructed according to published data. The feasibility of using the generic model in numerical research of electromagnetic fields (EMF) was demonstrated by means of comparative simulations with eye models reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) scans. Free‐form deformation (FFD) was used to deform the OAL of the generic eye model. Thus, 64 deformed eyes were created and were categorized according to the OAL increase. The finite‐difference time‐domain (FDTD) method was applied in the simulations. The results revealed that changing the OAL does not increase EMF absorption in the eyes or the eye tissues. No additional induced temperature rise was produced by the changes of OAL. The results also indicated that the non‐pathological increment of the OAL, which is inevitable during the childhood, does not increase the SAR in the eyes.

Ever light hundred.;FullPaper;The organ‐specific averaged specific absorption rate (SARosa) in a heterogeneous human body phantom, the Virtual Family Boy, is determined for the first time in five realistic electromagnetic environments at the Global System for Mobile Communications downlink frequency of 950 MHz. We propose two methods based upon a fixed set of finite‐difference time‐domain (FDTD) simulations for generating cumulative distribution functions for the SARosa in a certain environment: an accurate vectorial cell‐wise spline interpolation with an average error lower than 1.8%, and a faster scalar linear interpolation with a maximal average error of 14.3%. These errors are dependent on the angular steps chosen for the FDTD simulations. However, it is demonstrated that both methods provide the same shape of the cumulative distribution function for the studied organs in the considered environments. The SARosa depends on the considered organ and the environment. Two factors influencing the SARosa are investigated for the first time: conductivity over the density ratio of an organ, and the distance of the organ's center of gravity to the body's surface and exterior of the phantom. A non‐linear regression with our model provides a correlation of 0.80. The SARosa due to single plane‐wave exposure is also investigated; a worst‐case single plane‐wave exposure is determined for all studied organs and has been compared with realistic SARosa values. There is no fixed worst‐case polarization for all organs, and a single plane‐wave exposure condition that exceeds 91% of the SARosa values in a certain environment can always be found for the studied organs.

Doctor maintain nation commercial pull character travel represent.;DemoPaper;In this article, compliance boundaries and allowed output powers are determined for the front, back, and side of multiple‐frequency base station antennas, based on the root‐mean‐squared electric field, the whole‐body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR), and the 10 g averaged SAR in both the limbs and the head and trunk. For this purpose, the basic restrictions and reference levels defined by the International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) for both the general public and occupational exposure are used. The antennas are designed for Global System for Mobile Communications around 900 MHz (GSM900), GSM1800, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), and Long Term Evolution (LTE), and are operated with output powers at the individual frequencies up to 300 W. The compliance boundaries are estimated using finite‐difference time‐domain simulations with the Virtual Family Male and have been determined for three directions with respect to the antennas for 800, 900, 1800, and 2600 MHz. The reference levels are not always conservative when the radiating part of the antenna is small compared to the length of the body. Combined compliance distances, which ensure compliance with all reference levels and basic restrictions, have also been determined for each frequency. A method to determine a conservative estimation of compliance boundaries for multiple‐frequency (cumulative) exposure is introduced. Using the errors on the estimated allowed powers, an uncertainty analysis is carried out for the compliance distances. Uncertainties on the compliance distances are found to be smaller than 122%.

Such complex structures are generally handled by numerical methods implemented in simulation software packages. The structures involving high discretization density (mainly based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and handled by Finite Difference Time Domain method) consume tremendously high computational resources. On the other hand, oversimplified numerical models, with coarser segmentation, will inevitably generate less accurate results. The aim of this study was to develop a simplified 3D model of a pregnant woman with the reasonable tradeoff between computing demands and result accuracy. The exposure to the plane wave and short antenna was examined and the SAR distribution, peak localized 10g-averaged SAR and volume-averaged SAR were determined in a broad frequency range (from 10 MHz to 1800 MHz).

Since simulations with large model spaces, or long non-sinusoidal waveforms, imply a huge amount of floating-point calculations, it is of practical interest to take advantage of current and emergent multicore architectures, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate this type of processing. The presented manuscript assess and compares the performance of different parallelization frameworks and different multicore architectures for exploiting parallelism when Maxwell's Equations have to be solved. The simulation of a plane wave propagation was used to assess the parallelization frameworks and options by using different application programming interfaces (APIs) and compilers. Moreover, implementations using these different approaches were executed in different CPU and GPUs architectures. Experimental results show that different frameworks led to different performance and, as expected, the GPUs achieve higher speedups when compared to CPUs.

Driven by the developments in computational techniques and computing power, personalised hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) has matured and has become a powerful tool for optimising treatment quality. Electromagnetic, ultrasound, and thermal simulations using realistic clinical set-ups are now being performed to achieve patient-specific treatment optimisation. In addition, extensive studies aimed to properly implement novel HT tools and techniques, and to assess the quality of HT, are becoming more common. In this paper, we review the simulation tools and techniques developed for clinical hyperthermia, and evaluate their current status on the path from ‘model’ to ‘clinic’. In addition, we illustrate the major techniques employed for validation and optimisation. HTP has become an essential tool for improvement, control, and assessment of HT treatment quality. As such, it plays a pivotal role in the quest to establish HT as an efficacious addition to multi-modality treatment of cancer.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/373d67150b8500cdd0f42afaa56aa355077551d0

The surface profile of the standing posture is adjusted by population measurement data. A non-uniform texture amplification approach is applied on the 2-D slices to recover the skin contour and to redistribute the internal tissues. Internal organ shift due to postures is taken into account. The feet are modified by matrix rotation.

Administration this never for.;FullPaper;When patients with metallic prosthetic implants undergo an MR procedure, the interaction between the RF field and the prosthetic device may lead to an increase in specific absorption rate (SAR) in tissues surrounding the prosthesis. In this work, the distribution of SAR10g around bilateral CoCrMo alloy hip prostheses in situ in anatomically realistic voxel models of an adult male and female due to RF fields from a generic birdcage coil driven at 64 or 128 MHz are predicted using a time‐domain finite integration technique. Results indicate that the spatial distribution and maximum values of SAR10g are dependent on body model, frequency, and the position of the coil relative to the body. Enhancement of SAR10g close to the extremities of a prosthesis is predicted. Values of SAR10g close to the prostheses are compliant with recommended limits if the prostheses are located outside the coil. However, caution is required when the prostheses are within the coil since the predicted SAR10g close to an extremity of a prosthesis exceeds recommended limits when the whole body averaged SAR is 2 W kg−1. Compliance with recommended limits is likely to require a reduction in the time averaged input power.

Audience see trade painting college new., Thought both successful effect like.;ShortPaper;This article reviews occupational exposure in clinical MRI; it specifically considers units of exposure, basic physical interactions, health effects, guideline limits, dosimetry, results of exposure surveys, calculation of induced fields and the status of the European Physical Agents Directive. Electromagnetic field exposure in MRI from the static field B(0), imaging gradients and radiofrequency transmission fields induces electric fields and currents in tissue, which are responsible for various acute sensory effects. The underlying theory and its application to the formulation of incident and induced field limits are presented. The recent International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers limits for incident field exposure are interpreted in a manner applicable to MRI. Field measurements show that exposure from movement within the B(0) fringe field can exceed ICNIRP reference levels within 0.5 m of the bore entrance. Rate of change of field dB/dt from the imaging gradients is unlikely to exceed the new limits, although incident field limits can be exceeded for radiofrequency (RF) exposure within 0.2-0.5 m of the bore entrance. Dosimetric surveys of routine clinical practice show that staff are exposed to peak values of 42 ± 24% of B(0), with time-averaged exposures of 5.2 ± 2.8 mT for magnets in the range 0.6-4 T. Exposure to time-varying fields arising from movement within the B(0) fringe resulted in peak dB/dt of approximately 2 T s(-1). Modelling of induced electric fields from the imaging gradients shows that ICNIRP-induced field limits are unlikely to be exceeded in most situations; however, movement through the static field may still present a problem. The likely application of the limits is discussed with respect to the reformulation of the European Union (EU) directive and its possible implications for MRI.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09ab53fa23951f37a7a81a863996b088a78fb8ce

SAR estimation is typically performed by numerical simulations using generic human body models. This entails an intrinsic uncertainty in present SAR prediction. This study first investigates the required detail of human body models in terms of spatial resolution and the number of soft tissue classes required, based on finite‐differences time‐domain simulations of a 3 T body coil. The numerical results indicate that a resolution of 5 mm is sufficient for local SAR estimation. Moreover, a differentiation between fatty tissues, water‐rich tissues, and the lungs was found to be essential to represent eddy current paths inside the human body. This study then proposes a novel approach for generating individualized body models from whole‐body water‐fat‐separated MR data and applies it to volunteers. The SAR hotspots consistently occurred in the arms due to proximity to the body coil as well as in narrow regions of the muscles. An initial in vivo validation of the simulated fields in comparison with measured B1‐field maps showed good qualitative and quantitative agreement.

In this study, we used NVIDIA Tesla C2070 as GPGPU boards. The performance of multi-GPU is evaluated in comparison with that of a single GPU and vector supercomputer. The calculation speed with four GPUs was approximately 3.5 times faster than with a single GPU, and was slightly (approx. 1.3 times) slower than with the supercomputer.

For a preliminary model, lossy dielectric spheres are simulated loading a cavity, and results are compared.

The interactions between these fields and human tissues in anatomical geometries results in a variety of effects regarding image integrity and safety of the human subject. In recent decades, numerical methods of calculation have been used increasingly to understand the effects of these interactions and aid in engineering better, faster, and safer equipment and methods. As magnetic resonance imaging techniques and technology have evolved through the years, so to have the requirements for meaningful interpretation of calculation results.

Finite‐difference time‐domain method was used to first validate the antenna model against measurement results published in the literature and then investigate the specific absorption rate (SAR) in two heterogeneous, anatomically correct human models (Virtual Family male and female) at distances from 10 to 1000 mm. Special attention was given to simultaneous exposure to fields of three different frequencies, their interaction and the additivity of SAR resulting from each frequency. The results show that the highest frequency—2100 MHz—results in the highest spatial‐peak SAR averaged over 10 g of tissue, while the whole‐body SAR is similar at all three frequencies. At distances >200 mm from the antenna, the whole‐body SAR is a more limiting factor for compliance to exposure guidelines, while at shorter distances the spatial‐peak SAR may be more limiting. For the evaluation of combined exposure, a simple summation of spatial‐peak SAR maxima at each frequency gives a good estimation for combined exposure, which was also found to depend on the distribution of transmitting power between the different frequency bands.

Many studies have considered exposure to plane waves with only one incidence angle. This paper investigates the exposure of the anthropomorphic model visible human (VH) induced by plane waves with different incidence angles. The incident-field-propagation direction describes in 10° steps all the azimuth around the model (0°-360°) for three elevation angles (90° and 90 ± 20°). Both vertical and horizontal polarizations are considered. Tilt at ±20° does not involve a significant difference on the exposure. Whole-body-exposure levels vary periodically with the azimuth as well as the illuminated surface of the model. A good correlation between the whole-body exposure and the illuminated surface is noted. Moreover, the illuminated surface of the VH can be quite accurately assessed by substituting the VH with an ellipsoid. Concerning the local exposure, the localization of 10 g peak spatial-averaged specific absorption rate is highly depending on the incidence angle. However, the most common position is located in the limbs or in the genital parts.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4903f82c6a5116e02cb18c0d3e976ffa23b3483

This study investigates numerically the variation on the whole-body and peak spatially averaged-specific absorption rate (SAR) in the heterogeneous virtual family male placed in front of a base station antenna in a reflective environment. The SAR values in a reflective environment are also compared to the values obtained when no environment is present (free space). The virtual family male has been placed at four distances (30 cm, 1 m, 3 m and 10 m) in front of six base station antennas (operating at 300 MHz, 450 MHz, 900 MHz, 2.1 GHz, 3.5 GHz and 5.0 GHz, respectively) and in three reflective environments (a perfectly conducting wall, a perfectly conducting ground and a perfectly conducting ground + wall). A total of 72 configurations are examined. The absorption in the heterogeneous body model is determined using the 3D electromagnetic (EM) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver Semcad-X. For the larger simulations, requirements in terms of computer resources are reduced by using a generalized Huygens' box approach. It has been observed that the ratio of the SAR in the virtual family male in a reflective environment and the SAR in the virtual family male in the free-space environment ranged from −8.7 dB up to 8.0 dB.

There are, however, questions remaining concerning the impact of age-dependent dielectric tissue properties and age-dependent proportions of the skull, face and ear on the global and local absorption, in particular in the brain tissues. In this study, we compare the absorption in various parts of the cortex for different magnetic resonance imaging-based head phantoms of adults and children exposed to different models of mobile phones. The results show that the locally induced fields in children can be significantly higher (>3 dB) in subregions of the brain (cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus) and the eye due to the closer proximity of the phone to these tissues. The increase is even larger for bone marrow (>10 dB) as a result of its significantly high conductivity. Tissues such as the pineal gland show no increase since their distances to the phone are not a function of age.

These four models are referred to as the Virtual Family. They are based on high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of healthy volunteers.

To improve the accuracy and the effectiveness of the segmentation, a novel semi-automated tool was used to analyze and segment the data. All tissues and organs were reconstructed as three-dimensional (3D) unstructured triangulated surface objects, yielding high precision images of individual features of the body. This greatly enhances the meshing flexibility and the accuracy with respect to thin tissue layers and small organs in comparison with the traditional voxel-based representation of anatomical models. Conformal computational techniques were also applied.

Since we cannot measure the induced electric fields and current densities inside the human body, we used the Visible Human (VH) to investigate the induced electric fields and currents in human body tissues and organs of a worker standing 2 m away from conductor phase C of a double-circuit 132 kV transmission line. The double circuit 132 kV 60 Hz transmission line has a power rating of 293 MVA and a maximum recorded peak load current of 603 A. Charge simulation method and the Biot-Savart law have been used for computation of external electric and magnetic fields. Finite-difference time-domain technique was used to calculate the organs' internal induced electric field and circulating current densities in more than 40 different tissues of the VH with 3 mm voxel size. The simulation indicates that, at 2 m away from a 132 kV transmission line, the computed external electric field is 6.485 kV/m and the external magnetic field is 66.4 muT, which are below the limits set by the IEEE standards for external exposure for live-line workers. The maximum induced electric fields in the brain and heart are 23 and 14 mV/m, respectively. These values are below the IEEE standard recommended limits of 53 mV/m for the brain and 943 mV/m for the heart. The VH data allowed us to obtain two- and three-dimensional images of the induced electric field and current density distribution in different organs, tissues, and cross-sections of the human body.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5909006be24e0e3a07dfe4cab29ed0d6a7d8a451

The procedure is based on a set of formulae for estimating the specific absorption rate (SAR) in certain directions around a class of common base station antennas. The formulae, given for both whole-body and localized SAR, require as input the frequency, the transmitted power and knowledge of antenna-related parameters such as dimensions, directivity and half-power beamwidths. With knowledge of the SAR in three key directions it is demonstrated how simple and practical compliance boundaries can be generated outside of which the exposure levels do not exceed certain limit values.

Preliminary validation of the MHD solver shows good agreement with values found in the literature [7] based on computational modeling. The implemented MHD solver is also able to calculate the induced fields in highly accurate models of the human anatomy. We will repeat the simulations in the future with an exact model of the geometry used in [7]. In addition we will perform an experimental validation to compare the MHD solver results with actual measurements. Future simulations will also include the calculation of the MHD signals for all four models of the Virtual Family. We will vary the orientation of the static magnetic field to maximize the MHD signal, and we will determine an optimized location for the measurement of the MHD signal. The optimal location for measuring the MHD signal is a location on the surface of the patient which maximizes the signal strength and optimizes the correlation of the MDH signal to the blood flow by minimizing the influence of the ECG signal. The volunteers based on which the Virtual Family models were developed (two adults and two children) will be used to measure the ECG signal and the combined ECG + MDH signal. The combined ECG + MDH will be measured inside a 3T MR scanner using an MR compatible ECG monitor. We will correlate the computational MHD results with the actual measurement.

In contrast, information about the EMP energy distribution and its variability in rats is lacking. EMPs are signals with spectrum concentrating in several hundred MHz, leading to EM absorption patterns different from those obtained at high frequencies. In this study, two anatomical models of rats (a male and a female) were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging. The models had the same posture as in the exposure experiments. Realistic EMPs were acquired directly from the EMP simulator and applied to the simulations. The interaction of the EMP with the rat was analyzed through the finite-difference time-domain method. Two approaches were utilized to calculate the energy absorption at the tissue and whole-body levels. Dosimetric variability due to incident directions, polarizations, exposure signals simplification, and rat separation was evaluated in this study. The variability result differed substantially from that of the non-constrained rats' exposure experiments. The result sensitivity to frequency and amplitude was discussed as well. The work can be used as a basis to determine the uncertainty and to formulate a standard experimental protocol for this type of experiment.;No;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40a887b2ec47bee613f9e23a109ce1181ccfbbed

The maximum predicted temperature (45.8°C for an incident power density of 475 mW/cm2) is in good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the model shows that there is a value for the incident power density (about 100 mW/cm2) for which the direction of aqueous humor flow due to buoyancy is inverted, because of the inversion of the temperature gradient in the anterior chamber of the eye.

METHODS: Of the 288 patients who underwent transplantation during the study period, 14 were fallers. Twenty controls were randomly selected. The study used descriptive case‐control analysis and simple logistic regression to analyze the data. FINDINGS: Eight fallers and four non‐fallers had high MFS scores. The logistic regression model indicated that patients with high MFS scores were 5.3 times more likely to fall and that for each day patients experienced diarrhea, their risk of fall increased 1.2 times.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/972628ff412c7a93f2b1c44e09d01e3cc40a8105

The evidence base for fall prevention strategies after receiving ECT is sparse. The risk factors for falls after ECT are vast and complex in nature, especially considering existing comorbid medical conditions. The dearth of research in guiding practitioners on fall reduction interventions for this patient population illuminates a gap in mental health care quality and safety. The purpose of the current nurse-led quality improvement project was to reduce falls in patients undergoing ECT by enhancing safety measures through education and a post-ECT treatment protocol. The project did not prove to be as efficacious as anticipated as measured by fall rate outcomes. Several factors that may account for the project's findings are discussed.

Exercise, especially moderate-to-high-intensity impact exercise, has been recommended as an effective, low-cost non-pharmacological strategy for bone strength improvement; however, evidence on fracture risk is limited. In addition, maintaining regular training is currently a problem. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a randomised controlled trial of moderate-to-high-intensity tele-exercise intervention using a tele-rehabilitation app and quantify its effects on vertical fracture and fall prevention in women at high risk of osteoporotic fractures. Methods and analysis In this multicentre, randomised controlled trial, 794 women at high risk of osteoporotic fractures will be recruited and randomised into either the tele-exercise rehabilitation or control group. Participants in the control group will receive routine remote rehabilitation, while those in the intervention group will be provided with a 6-month tele-exercise rehabilitation. The primary outcomes are the percentage of participants with one or more new vertebral fractures and incidence of falls. Intention-to-treat, full analysis set and per-protocol approaches will be used for outcome analyses. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the biomedical research ethics committee of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University (2021-579). Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant after agreeing to participate in the study. The study findings will be presented at national and international scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Results are propagated regardless of the magnitude or direction of the impact. Authorship is assigned according to authorship guidelines as defined by the International Board of Medical Journal Editors, and each author’s role is based on journal requirements for publication.

The aim of the paper were to assess fall risks and identify risk factors, related to falls among stroke patients. This was a retrospective cohort study that included 217 neurological patients with acute stroke who have experienced fall during hospitalization. Morse Fall Scale was used to estimate a likelihood of falling for hospitalized patients. In total, 1.4% patients with acute stroke experienced a fall during hospitalization. According to the fall risk assessment, 77% of the patients presented a high risk for falls. Women, older respondents and those who were hospitalized for period longer than 22 days and who had higher levels of care, had higher values of Morse score. The most common risk factors for falls are: the presence of other medical diagnosis, the use of disability aids while walking, the use of intravenous therapy, disorientation in time and space, and the largest contribution to Morse score comes from using disability aids while walking and transferring patients. Greater risk of falling was observed in older neurological patients with ischemic type of stroke and weakness on the left side of the body, patients with longer hospitalization period and those with higher level of care.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a70ddd6bf1c8029c122af4ceb7915897b6411b56

Patient falls during hospitalisation were assessed by self-report and incident reports. Pain intensity and the occurrence and distress of 15 other symptoms were assessed by self-report., , , RESULTS, Patient falls were associated with male sex and having more comorbidities. Medical patients were more likely to fall than elective surgical patients. In logistic regression analyses, higher symptom counts were associated with increased risk of fall, with each additional symptom conferring a 15% increase in fall risk. Symptom distress related to concentration difficulties, lack of energy, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea was associated with increased risk of fall, even after adjusting for the influence of age, sex and comorbidities (odds ratios ranged 2.3-4.8). Severe pain, as well as symptom distress related to drowsiness, itching, dizziness or swelling of arms/legs, was also associated with patient falls, although these associations were attenuated after accounting for age, sex and comorbidities. Overall, symptom distress was more strongly associated with fall risk than symptom occurrence., , , CONCLUSIONS, Symptom burden and distress may help identify hospital patients at risk for fall. Additional research is needed to determine whether symptoms are useful for assessing fall risk among hospital patients and other high-risk populations. If symptoms are useful indicators of fall risk, they should be considered for inclusion in standardised risk assessments., , , RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE, Clinicians ought to pay particular attention to increased fall risk among patients reporting many symptoms and those experiencing distress from concentration difficulties, fatigue, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a6d9230625ee82ea130932cf30500619f14d525

We have performed two evaluations of such treatments. In Experiment 1, 12 children participated in a double-blind within-subject crossover design to test the acute (2-day) administration of four preparations: 10 mg methylphenidate, 12.5 mg meclizine, both methylphenidate and meclizine, or placebo. Improvements obtained with each drug were scattered across measures of reading fluency balance and coordination, and eye movements, suggesting that a chronic trial would be justified. In Experiment 2, six children from Experiment 1 received 12.5 mg meclizine b.i.d. for 3 months and placebo for 3 months in a double-blind within-subject crossover design. Meclizine had no effect on reading, but it significantly improved ocular motor stability during steady fixation.

Treating this disorder includes education of reading practices and treating psychological disorders, and there are no exact medications prescribed in these children. Memantine has been effective in treating memory problems in Alzheimer Dementia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, autism disorder, and other psychological diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of memantine in improving RD in children. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 62 children, with RD in Pediatric Psychiatry Clinics of Noor and Ali-Asghar Hospital in Isfahan from 2015 to 2016, were participated. They were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number, one receiving education plus memantine and the other education plus placebo. RD was evaluated at the beginning, 1 and 3 months after intervention by Iranian standard reading and dyslexia test (Nama). Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of participants was 7.55 (0.60) years. Most of the participants were boy (55%), most having parents in 36–45-year-old age group (52% and 48% for fathers and mothers, respectively), and also most parents in diploma and bachelor educational group (61% and 60% for fathers and mothers, respectively). There were statistical significant difference in trend of total score (P = 0.034), word chain (P < 0.001), rhyming (P < 0.001), text comprehension (P < 0.001), and letter fluency (P = 0.002), subscale between two groups. However, the difference of time trend between two groups was not significant in word reading (P = 0.14), word comprehension (P = 0.06), phoneme deletion (P = 0.12), reading nonwords (P = 0.32), and category fluency (P = 0.06). Conclusion: Adding memantine to educational practices is effective in improving RD in school-age children with LD.;Yes;No;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22bcdd0a852012bb17a26d0b8021817304e59bdc

Customer to positive west letter.;FullPaper;In the past 5 years, we have witnessed the continuation of important trends in clinical research that began earlier in the decade. With regard to the treatment of specific disorders in children and adolescents, the most significant developments have been the examination of the tricyclics for the treatment of depression and the initiation of controlled studies for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. Unfortunately, the findings from the depression studies have been uniformly negative, and the results of research on both depression and tic disorders show a relatively high rate of placebo responsivity, which raises nagging questions about the role of case reports and open trials. Another important trend in pediatric psychopharmacotherapy is the search for substitutes for the neuroleptics. Potential candidates include agents such as lithium, naltrexone, fenfluramine, clonidine, and carbamazepine. The most underresearched disorders are a combination of the least common (e.g. schizophrenia, mania) and those that are apparently perceived as less serious (e.g. sleep disorders, certain anxiety disorders). Not surprisingly, the most studied disorder and treatment is hyperactivity and stimulant medication, respectively. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the social implications of the associated symptoms and their response to stimulant drugs, aided greatly by the use of direct observation procedures. Researchers are beginning to attend to the implications of comorbidity for assessing response to medication. There has been additional confirmation of efficacy of stimulant treatment for preschoolers and adolescents. Dose-response issues remain to some extent unresolved, the primary impediments being interpretive misconceptions associated with trend analysis, an overreliance on the syndromal perspective and too little attention to target behaviors and their clinical implications, and the failure to operationalize the minimal effective dose with regard to the normalization and supranormalization of target and collateral behaviors. Disagreement over whether hyperactivity is a learning or a behavior disorder (or both) and what academic underproductivity means clinically and socially is also impeding progress. With regard to developmental disorders, controlled studies indicate that fenfluramine and naltrexone are effective for managing associated symptoms in some individuals. However, given the limited amount of research on these agents, their status as clinically useful palliatives must be considered tentative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS);Yes;Yes;1992;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2d82800a5747ddd0c5c6c22ba72c3a2ec9d0a29

Factor cut our music make.;ShortPaper;BACKGROUND, Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with just antipsychotic drug treatment and various adjunct medications are used to promote additional response. The antiepileptic carbamazepine is one such drug., , , OBJECTIVES, To examine whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychoses and whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine augmentation of neuroleptic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses., , , SEARCH METHODS, For the original version we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (December 2001), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), Biological Abstracts (1980-2001), PsycLIT (1886-2001) and PSYNDEX (1974-2001). For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials in July 2012. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carbamazepine or compounds of the carbamazepine family with placebo or no intervention, whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective psychoses., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect, risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE., , , MAIN RESULTS, The updated search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. The number of included studies therefore remains at 10 with the number of participants randomised still 283.One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months. No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n = 31, RR 1.07 CI 0.78 to 1.45). Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia. No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores (1 RCT n = 38, RR 1.23 CI 0.78 to 1.92). A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n = 38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.043). Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo, we were able use GRADE for quality of evidence for these results. Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n = 182, RR 0.47 CI 0.16 to 1.35, very low quality evidence). Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2 RCTs n = 38, RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.88). There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n = 147, RR 0.86 CI 0.67 to 1.12, low quality evidence). Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.38 CI 0.14 to 1.02). No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, Based on currently available randomised trial-derived evidence, carbamazepine cannot be recommended for routine clinical use for treatment or augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. At present large, simple well-designed and reported trials are justified - especially if focusing on people with violent episodes and people with schizoaffective disorders or those with both schizophrenia and EEG abnormalities.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eddf44c6b1ef17d60848ac186635985296570020

Measures of attention (Conners' Continuous Performance Test [CPT], Conners' Rating Scales [CRS]), academic abilities (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test [WIAT]), social skills (Social Skills Rating System [SSRS]), and behavioral problems (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) were administered at premedication baseline and at the end of the MPH trial while on medication. A cancer control group composed of patients who were not administered MPH (brain tumor = 31 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia = 23) was assessed on the same measures 12 [corrected] months apart., , , RESULTS, For the MPH group, repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant improvement in performance on a measure of sustained attention (CPT indices, P < .05); parent, teacher, and self-report ratings of attention (CRS indices, P < .05), and parent ratings of social skills or behavioral problems (SSRS and CBCL indices; P < .05). In contrast, the cancer control group only showed improvement on parent ratings of attention (Conners' Parent Rating Scale indices; P < .05) and social skills (SSRS and CBCL indices; P < .05).

METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors (N = 103) identified as having attention and learning problems completed a randomized, double-blind, 3-week, home-crossover trial of placebo, low-dose methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg; 10 mg twice daily maximum) and moderate-dose methylphenidate (0.6 mg/kg; 20 mg twice daily maximum). Caregivers completed the Barkley Side Effects Rating Scale (SERS) at baseline and each week during the medication trial. Siblings of cancer survivors (N = 49) were recruited as a healthy comparison group. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher number and severity of symptoms endorsed on the SERS when patients were taking moderate dose compared with placebo or low dose, but not low dose compared with placebo. The number of side effects endorsed on the SERS was significantly lower during all 3 home-crossover weeks (placebo, low dose, moderate dose) when compared with baseline symptom scores. The severity of side effects was also significantly lower, compared with baseline screening, during placebo and low-dose weeks but not moderate-dose weeks. Both the number and severity of symptoms endorsed at baseline were significantly higher for patients compared with siblings. Female gender and lower IQ were associated with higher adverse effect levels. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate is generally well tolerated by childhood cancer survivors. There is a subgroup at increased risk for side effects that may need to be closely monitored or prescribed a lower medication dose. The seemingly paradoxical findings of increased “side effects” at baseline must be considered when monitoring side effects and designing clinical trials.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd6e1210cdf7e6663955d370cb725eeab88660db

Service word executive against executive. Ahead social final region someone.;Discuss last family fund possible different imagine month. Figure student serious middle.;Poster;A limited number of studies have considered whether the activity of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) contributes to the problems experienced by youngsters with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this article is to review this work and propose interpretations. Peripheral measures of 5-HT and its metabolite do not point to a widespread association with the diagnosis. However, separate consideration of the major domains of dysfunction (motor activity, inattention and impulsivity) support a more differentiated assessment. The marked innervation of motor regions of the brain by 5-HT projections and the clear involvement of 5-HT systems in the control of locomotion in animals suggests a likely node for dysfunction in ADHD. The few relevant studies do not show evidence of this, but more attention should be accorded to the issue. The situation is different for attention-related processes; here, there are deficiencies in perceptual sensitivity and the appropriate designation of saliency to stimulation. These are attributable, in part, to altered 5-HT activity. Marked and opposite changes of 5-HT responsivity are associated with behavioral and cognitive impulsivity. There is also a growing series of studies demonstrating preferential transmission of various genetic markers for 5-HT receptors that are expressed in ADHD. Currently, the heterogeneity of methods in this young discipline restricts the possibilities of definition of these markers and the types of ADHD in which they are expressed.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afe7ba9532c568d97a6484e46fe457ed63906698

The antiepileptic carbamazepine is one such drug., , , OBJECTIVES, To evaluate the effects of carbamazepine and its derivatives for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychoses., , , SEARCH STRATEGY, For the original version we searched Biological Abstracts (1980-2001), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (December 2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), PsycLIT (1886-2001) and PSYNDEX (1974-2001). For the current update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials in March 2005 and in December 2006. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data., , , SELECTION CRITERIA, We included all randomised controlled trials comparing carbamazepine or compounds of the carbamazepine family to placebo or no intervention, whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective psychoses., , , DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD)., , , MAIN RESULTS, The update search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. The number of included studies therefore remains at ten with the number of participants randomised still 258. One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months. No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n=31, RR 4.1 CI 0.8 to 1.5). Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia. No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in BPRS scores (1 RCT n=38, RR 1.2 CI 0.8 to 1.9). A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n=38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.04, NNH 1 CI 0.9 to 1.4). Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo. Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n=182, RR 0.5 CI 0.2 to 1.4). Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2RCTs n=38, RR 0.6 CI 0.4 to 0.9, NNT 2 CI 1 to 5). There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n=147, RR 0.9 CI 0.7 to 1.1). Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n=20, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.0). No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder., , , AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS, Based on currently available randomised trial-derived evidence, carbamazepine cannot be recommended for routine clinical use for treatment or augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. At present large, simple well-designed and reported trials are justified especially if focusing on those with violent episodes and people with schizoaffective disorders or those with both schizophrenia and EEG abnormalities.;Yes;No;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/504f91ece64ab1bf8dfaf086eca4ed9fe5fcc656

Three percent +/- 7% of visits in the respondents' practices were for pediatric insomnia, although there was a wide range in the numbers of children identified during a typical 6-month practice period. More than 75% of practitioners had recommended nonprescription medications, and >50% had prescribed a sleep medication. Specific clinical circumstances in which medications were most commonly used were acute pain and travel, followed by children with special needs (mental retardation, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Antihistamines were the most commonly reported nonprescription medications for sleep. Melatonin or herbal remedies had been recommended by approximately 15% of the respondents. alpha-agonists were the most frequently prescribed sleep medications (31%). The likelihood of prescribing medication for sleep was 2- to 4-fold greater in respondents who treated children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for daytime behavioral problems or nocturnal sleep problems, respectively. Practitioners expressed a range of concerns about sleep medication appropriateness, safety, tolerance, and side effects in children., , , CONCLUSIONS, The practice of prescribing or recommending sedatives and hypnotics for pediatric insomnia is common among community-based pediatricians, especially among special needs patients. An empirically based approach to the use of these medications is needed.;No;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/149b2e05a9b22e1220445e05f1737e7633d7fbd2

Medication is being used not just to treat children of normal intelligence with hyperkinetic disorder or depression, but also to modify behavioural problems in children with developmental disorders and severe learning difficulties. Literature reviews highlight the lack of robust randomized controlled drug trials on which to base clinical practice and the authors have found no appropriate existing protocols to help develop a systematized approach. Against such a background the authors have developed a comprehensive set of protocols covering prescribing details for individual drugs, and also addressing issues such as informed consent, long-term monitoring and school liaison. All children referred to the authors' clinics go through a standardized decision-making process. This article describes both the protocols themselves and the philosophies that guided their development.

Consensus suggestions can standardise care, thereby improving outcomes and facilitating future research. Methods An International Task Force was composed and agreement regarding courses of action was measured using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. 70% agreement was necessary to make a consensus suggestion. Results The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3 months. The Task Force was unable to reach sufficient agreement to yield consensus suggestions for the post-hospital care of COVID-19 survivors. The Task Force fell one vote shy of suggesting routine screening for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions The Task Force addressed questions related to pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19 and the post-hospital care of survivors, yielding several consensus suggestions. Management options for which there is insufficient agreement to formulate a suggestion represent research priorities. For patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia who require oxygen support, the International Task Force made suggestions for remdesivir and dexamethasone, but against hydroxychloroquine.

The influence of hARF severity on patients’ outcomes is still poorly understood. Design Observational, prospective, multicentre study. Setting Three academic hospitals in Milan (Italy) involving three respiratory high dependency units and three general wards. Participants Consecutive adult hospitalised patients with a virologically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients aged <18 years or unable to provide informed consent were excluded. Interventions Anthropometrical, clinical characteristics and blood biomarkers were assessed within the first 24 hours from admission. hARF was graded as follows: severe (partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) <100 mm Hg); moderate (PaO2/FiO2 101–200 mm Hg); mild (PaO2/FiO2 201–300 mm Hg) and normal (PaO2/FiO2 >300 mm Hg). Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the assessment of clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality based on the severity of respiratory failure. Secondary outcomes were intubation rate and application of continuous positive airway pressure during hospital stay. Results 412 patients were enrolled (280 males, 68%). Median (IQR) age was 66 (55–76) years with a PaO2/FiO2 at admission of 262 (140–343) mm Hg. 50.2% had a cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of mild, moderate and severe hARF was 24.4%, 21.9% and 15.5%, respectively. In-hospital mortality proportionally increased with increasing impairment of gas exchange (p<0.001). The only independent risk factors for mortality were age ≥65 years (HR 3.41; 95% CI 2.00 to 5.78, p<0.0001), PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤200 mm Hg (HR 3.57; 95% CI 2.20 to 5.77, p<0.0001) and respiratory failure at admission (HR 3.58; 95% CI 1.05 to 12.18, p=0.04). Conclusions A moderate-to-severe impairment in PaO2/FiO2 was independently associated with a threefold increase in risk of in-hospital mortality. Severity of respiratory failure is useful to identify patients at higher risk of mortality.

Finally population fund left course open.;DemoPaper;Purpose To investigate the role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in assessing intubation timing for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Materials and methods Seventy-two patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were admitted to a makeshift intensive care unit (ICU). All patients underwent bedside lung ultrasonography one to two times per day. The patients were either intubated, treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or given high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after a discussion with the multidisciplinary group after their conditions worsened. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed daily after intubation, and patients received mechanical ventilation. Lung ultrasound was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after patients were admitted to the ICU; if the patient was intubated, LUS determination was performed before intubation within 24 h (T1) and on days 1, 2, 5, and 7 after intubation (T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively).The goal of this study was to evaluate the severity of lung aeration loss in intubated and non-intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by ultrasound at different time points within one week. Results A total of 16 patients were included in this study, including nine who were intubated and mechanically ventilated and seven patients without intubation. The number of elderly individuals in the intubated group was higher than in the non-intubated group (P < 0.05). In addition, there were more male than female patients in both groups. Patient characteristics (BMI, SOFA, and PaO2/FiO2 value) were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). The 28-day mortality rate of intubated patients was higher than that of non-intubated patients; six patients in the intubated group and two patients in the non-intubated group died. Nine intubated patients showed changes in LUS within seven days (n = 9). The mean LUS within 24 h before intubation was 12.8 ± 1.3. LUS was significantly higher on T1 than on T5 (P <0.05), and did not significantly differ from T1 to T4. Comparing LUS between intubated and non-intubated patients on T1 showed that the LUS of intubated patients was significantly higher than that of non-intubated patients (P <0.05). Between the two patient groups, oxygenation index was 140.1 ± 7.7 vs. 137.8 ± 5.9 on T1, and the respiratory rate of the two groups was 26 ± 5 vs. 28 ± 4 breaths/min. Neither oxygenation index nor RR significantly differed between the two groups. Conclusion LUS may be an effective tool for assessing intubation timing in critically ill patients with Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f79bda8b72ae03bf3ddef06fe5c9f8e910b40439

Patients may have severe hypoxaemia without proportional features of respiratory distress, also known as ‘silent’ or ‘apathetic’ hypoxia. We present a case of a 56-year-old man with COVID-19 who presented to the fever clinic of our institution with fever and cough without any respiratory distress but low oxygen saturation. The patient deteriorated over the next 2 days but eventually recovered of his illness in due course of time. This case demonstrates ‘silent hypoxia’ as a possible presentation in COVID-19 and emphasises the importance of meticulous clinical examination including oxygen saturation measurements in suspected or confirmed patients.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e5dffe48888ccd677469b60c917691681542ec2

Further, many publications on COVID-19 have debated the puzzling clinical characteristics of ‘silent hypoxemia’, ‘happy hypoxemics’ and ‘atypical ARDS’, all features consistent with OP. The recent announcement that RECOVERY, a randomised controlled trial comparing dexamethasone to placebo in COVID-19, was terminated early due to excess deaths in the control group further suggests patients present with OP given that corticosteroid therapy is the first-line treatment. Although RECOVERY along with other cohort studies report positive effects with corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, treatment approaches could be made more effective given that secondary OP often requires prolonged duration and/or careful and monitored tapering of corticosteroid dose, with ‘pulse’ doses needed for the well-described fulminant subtype. Increasing recognition of this diagnosis will thus lead to more appropriate and effective treatment strategies in COVID-19, which may lead to a further reduction of need for ventilatory support and improved survival.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2669554e117e3013609436ca616ff1307e7882f

Objective: To determine the progression of disease and subsequent determinants of hospitalization. Design: A prospective outpatient cohort. Setting: Outpatients were recruited by phone between April 21 to June 23, 2020 after receiving outpatient or emergency department testing within a large health network in Maryland, USA. Participants: Outpatient adults with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: Symptoms, portable pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate, and temperature were collected by participants on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after enrollment. Baseline demographics, comorbid conditions were evaluated for risk of subsequent hospitalization using negative binomial, logistic, and random effects logistic regression. Results: Among 118 SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients, the median age was 56.0 years (IQR, 50.0 to 63.0) and 50 (42.4%) were male. Among those reporting active symptoms, the most common symptoms during the first week since symptom onset included weakness/fatigue (67.3%), cough (58.0%), headache (43.8%), and sore throat (34.8%). Participants returned to their usual health a median of 20 days (IQR, 13 to 38) from the symptom onset, and only 65.5% of respondents were at their usual health during the fourth week of illness. Over 28 days, 10.9% presented to the emergency department and 7.6% required hospitalization. Individuals at the same duration of illness had a 6.1 times increased adjusted odds of subsequent hospitalization per every percent decrease in home SaO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41 to 31.23, p=0.02). Limitations: Severity and duration of illness may differ in a younger population. Conclusion: Symptoms often persisted but uncommonly progressed to hospitalization. Home SaO2 might be an important adjunctive tool to identify progression of COVID-19.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fea833ffd266e7eb5817a3e47928ae06163c3ed

Management of patients complicated with neurological illness requiring neurocritical care is challenging during this time. Patients with neurological disease may develop COVID-19 infection or there could be independent neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Critically ill neurological patients are more vulnerable to contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, neurological patients with comorbidities and multisystem involvement are at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Though SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the pulmonary system, it can complicate the assessment and management of neurological patients. With increasing COVID-19 numbers, the hospitalizations of both non-COVID and COVID-19 neurological patients will bring significant strain on the hospital and neurocritical care facilities. Streamlining work pattern, understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its impact on neurological function, establishing general and specific neurocritical care management strategies, ensuring protection and well-being of health care providers, and implementing effective infection control policies are key elements of efficient neurocritical care management during this pandemic. This joint position statement and advisory on the practice of neurocritical care during the COVID-19 pandemic by the Neurocritical Care Society of India and the Indian Society of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care has been developed to guide clinicians providing care to the critically ill neurological patients in the neurocritical care unit during the current pandemic. As the situation from this novel disease is rapidly evolving, readers must constantly update themselves with newly emerging evidence to provide the best possible care to the critically ill neurological patients.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4a823be4d2801acdb6c2f8ef71db2549e488ad4

Might throughout father bit director.;ShortPaper;This is a proposal for an automated detection and remote monitoring system made up of a centralized network of communicating portable electronic devices based on biomedical sensors operating in the IoT context in synergy with wireless sensor network technologies, telemedicine and artificial intelligence. This network will be deployed to monitor a population settling in a target area (cities, region, country, etc.). The goal of this system is the detection and early diagnosis of the disease in people infected with the COVID-19 virus, using a device (such as a bracelet or a chest strap). This device collects in real time all the necessary biomedical measurements of a person, including their location, freeing them from any hospitalization or use of complex and expensive equipment. These informations are then transmitted, via a wireless connection, to a regional or national control center which takes care of its storage in a specialized database.

Rigorous and widespread testing remains a critical component of strategies for containing this pandemic. The limited availability of molecular diagnostics constrains the use of these technologies to those who present with disease. The current gold standards rely on detection of viral RNA typically by RT-PCR, but such approaches, as commonly implemented, have significant disadvantages. First, the nasopharyngeal swab is uncomfortable and may not be tolerated well by all patients, particularly children or the elderly. Second, false negative rates remain a significant concern, with some RT-PCR tests exhibiting values as high as 15% ( 2 ). Third, swab samples must be collected by trained staff to avoid false negatives or inclusive tests ( 3 , 4 ). Fourth, samples must be transported via viral medium to centralized laboratory facilities, where delays for rural or remote areas can reach 48 hours or longer ( 5 ). Alternative tests based on antibodies offer some promise, but the appearance of antibodies (IgM and IgG) can lag weeks to months after the initial exposure ( 6 ). Furthermore, positive antibody titers may potentially only reflect prior exposure as opposed to protective immunity. Emerging evidence suggests re-infection by endemic coronaviruses is not atypical, thereby adding complications to protocols for follow-up molecular testing ( 6 , 7 ). The net result is a continuing gap between widespread population level testing and the availability of tests, likely to persist for the foreseeable future ( 8 - 11 ). These circumstances motivate the development of complementary technologies for diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19 infections ( 2 , 12 , 13 ). , , The demand for …;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f079105a2b2897eba822f180ed754c04d1773f3

Here, we compared the penetration of dexamethasone from an ethanolic hydroxyethyl cellulose gel into ex vivo human skin, murine skin, and RHS. For comprehensive insights into skin morphology and penetration enhancing mechanisms, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and stimulated Raman spectromicroscopy (SRS) were combined. STXM offers high spatial resolution with label-free drug detection and is therefore sensitive to tissue damage. Despite differences in sample preparation and data analysis, the amounts of dexamethasone in RHS, detected and quantified by STXM and LC-MS/MS, were very similar and increased during the first 100 min of exposure. SRS revealed interactions between the gel and the stratum corneum or, more specifically, its protein and lipid structures. Similar to both types of ex vivo skin, higher protein-to-lipid ratios within the stratum corneum of RHS indicated reduced lipid amounts after 30 min of ethanol exposure. Extended ethanol exposure led to a continued reduction of lipids in the ex vivo matrixes, while protein integrity appeared to be compromised in RHS, which led to declining protein signals. In conclusion, LC-MS/MS proved the predictive capability of STXM for label-free drug detection. Combining STXM with SRS precisely dissected the penetration enhancing effects of ethanol. Further studies on topical drug delivery should consider the potential of these complementary techniques.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09bc7fbc0266697d9a33e671cf519e7f1cad0a2e

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an important non-opioid component of this approach. However, besides potential other adverse effects, there has been a longstanding discussion on the potentially harmful effects of NSAIDs on healing after surgery and trauma. This review describes current knowledge of the effects of NSAIDs on healing of bones, cartilage, soft tissue, wounds, flaps and enteral anastomoses. Overall, animal data suggest some potentially harmful effects, but are contradictory in most areas studied. Human data are limited and of poor quality; in particular, there are only very few good randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but many cohort studies with potential for significant confounding factors influencing the results. The limited human data available are not precluding the use of NSAIDs postoperatively, in particular, short-term for less than 2 weeks.

Assume way view player.;DemoPaper;Abstract Background Nonsurgical and surgical weight loss options have improved over the past several decades resulting in an increased number of patients who present with body contour deformities. This review focuses on the upper truncal deformity. This deformity is discernable by its residual tissue laxity in the upper arm, back, lateral chest, and breast. Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the morbidity of this procedure when these regions are treated in one operative setting. Methods A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent an upper body lift for truncal deformities after massive weight loss by the senior author between August 2006 and December 2019 was performed. Patient comorbidities and demographics, preoperative parameters, operative factors, and minor and major complications were assessed. Results No intraoperative or major complications occurred. The overall complication rate was 71% (20/28), which were all minor and most related to wound breakdown. Using logistical regression analysis, we found that neither BMI nor amount of weight resected contributed to a higher complication rate in this cohort. Simple matching coefficients analysis identified anemia, hypertension, lifetime smoking history, celecoxib use, and multiple concurrent procedures as comorbidities and intraoperative factors with an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Conclusions This review helps define the role of upper body lift in the care of patients with massive weight loss and addresses the morbidity of a comprehensive approach to upper body deformity. Appropriate patient selection, preoperative patient counseling, sound operative technique, and supportive postoperative care can help to avoid adverse outcomes.

Sort second create write value with listen., Yard child animal hit investment.;ShortPaper;Aspirin is a generally well‐tolerated drug that is now widely used in aged patients for its antithrombotic action. Aspirin works through several pathways to reduce inflammation, fever and to alter platelet activity. The scientific literature suggests that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes by aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs may be deleterious to normal wound repair processes and result in healing inhibition. However, novel effects of aspirin on other pathways that regulate inflammation and repair have been reported more recently. These pathways, including inhibition of inflammatory second messengers and transcription factor pathways and production of anti‐inflammatory, pro‐resolution factors (lipoxins), provide a possible explanation for beneficial effects of aspirin in chronic wound healing. There have been limited studies to date that provide good evidence to support aspirin use in chronic venous leg ulcers but this may change as we see results from randomized trials that are currently being undertaken. In this article, we look at possible effects that aspirin administration may have on venous leg ulcer healing and the expanding knowledge of potential beneficial effects of aspirin that operate via novel pathways. Though the literature suggests that aspirin treatment and cyclooxygenase inhibition may have deleterious effects in normal healing, it is possible that in chronic wounds that may be trapped in an inflammatory state that aspirin treatment may result in beneficial outcomes.;Yes;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d69f0920baa4704365d1daa88323bf014ec1697

More college foreign generation his series laugh.;FullPaper;Wound healing is a highly coordinated and complex process involving various cell types, chemical mediators and the surrounding extracellular matrix, resulting in a tightly orchestrated re-establishment of tissue integrity by specific cytokines. It consists of various dynamic processes including a series of overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation, re-epithelialization and remodeling. One of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the disturbances in wound healing is an out-of-control inflammatory response that can cause pathological consequences, such as hypertrophic scars, keloids or chronic wounds and ulcers. Recently, several reports have evaluated the effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on tissue repair. In particular, the data analysis supports an anti-inflammatory effect of EMFs by the modulation of cytokine profiles that drive the transition from a chronic pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state of the healing process. In this review, we focus on the effect of EMFs on skin wound healing showing emerging details of the anti-inflammatory effects of EMFs, with a view to cytokines as candidate biomarkers. Molecular clarification of the mechanisms involved in the modulation of inflammatory factors following exposure to EMFs will provide a better understanding of the cellular responses induced by EMFs and a potential, additional treatment in non-responding, chronic wounds.;No;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/520b91534a1b17422b47e8a257b137c4b4795d03

Style system television edge office.;DemoPaper;Background Birch bark has a long lasting history as a traditional medicinal remedy to accelerate wound healing. Recently, the efficacy of birch bark preparations has also been proven clinically. As active principle pentacyclic triterpenes are generally accepted. Here, we report a comprehensive study on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the wound healing properties of a well-defined birch bark preparation named as TE (triterpene extract) as well as the isolated single triterpenes in human primary keratinocytes and porcine ex-vivo wound healing models. Methodology/Principal Findings We show positive wound healing effects of TE and betulin in scratch assay experiments with primary human keratinocytes and in a porcine ex-vivo wound healing model (WHM). Mechanistical studies elucidate that TE and betulin transiently upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cyclooxygenase-2 on gene and protein level. For COX-2 and IL-6 this increase of mRNA is due to an mRNA stabilizing effect of TE and betulin, a process in which p38 MAPK and HuR are involved. TE promotes keratinocyte migration, putatively by increasing the formation of actin filopodia, lamellipodia and stress fibers. Detailed analyses show that the TE components betulin, lupeol and erythrodiol exert this effect even in nanomolar concentrations. Targeting the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on the activation of Rho GTPases. Conclusion/Significance Our results provide insights to understand the molecular mechanism of the clinically proven wound healing effect of birch bark. TE and betulin address the inflammatory phase of wound healing by transient up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory mediators. Further, they enhance migration of keratinocytes, which is essential in the second phase of wound healing. Our results, together with the clinically proven efficacy, identify birch bark as the first medical plant with a high potential to improve wound healing, a field which urgently needs effective remedies.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65e7f0393bb8677784cb842e98ceb41f416b7e8d

In this study, we examined a double paracrine mechanism between keratinocytes and fibroblasts through interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) and an IL‐1‐induced inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using the skin equivalent. The epidermal layer of the skin equivalent expressed high levels of IL‐1α mRNA (IL1A mRNA) and relatively low levels of IL‐1β mRNA (IL1B mRNA). IL1A mRNA was not detected in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also expressed low but not negligible levels of IL1B mRNA only in the presence of keratinocytes. Expression of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 mRNA (PTGS2 mRNA) and production of PGE2 in three‐dimensionally cultured fibroblasts were noticeably stimulated by co‐culture with keratinocytes, whereas PTGS2 mRNA expression in the epidermal layer was very low. In addition, hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15‐(NAD) mRNA was highly expressed in keratinocytes but not in fibroblasts, and exogenous IL‐1β stimulated PTGS2 mRNA expression in the dermal equivalent. The thickness of the epidermal layer and the number of MKI67‐positive keratinocytes in the skin equivalent were decreased by treatment with indomethacin, and the decrease recovered when exogenous PGE2 was added. These results indicate that keratinocytes stimulate their own proliferation through a double paracrine mechanism mediated by IL‐1 and PGE2.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e6a2e7d0d8ee6876cc94841adc1ca860b2c9a3f

They reviewed the clinical and histological presentation of hypergranulation tissue as well as the evidence for the most widely used treatments., , , RESULTS, There is only one case series and one case report of epidermal maturation arrest, and the former gives the most detailed clinical and histological description including response to treatment. The clinical description, histological findings, and response to treatment of all cases are comparable to that of persistent granulation tissue and there is no histological or cytological data provided to support that epidermal maturation arrest exists as a distinct entity., , , CONCLUSION, Among the cases of epidermal maturation arrest reported in the literature, there is insufficient evidence that keratinocytes acquired a state of arrest in their migration.

Film seek parent institution space ground job. End painting government mean upon.;FullPaper;Recent findings suggest that modulation of ion channels might be implicated in some of the clinical effects of coxibs, selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Celecoxib and its inactive analog 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, but not rofecoxib, can suppress or augment ionic currents and alter functioning of neurons and myocytes. To better understand these unexpected effects, we have recently investigated the mechanism of inhibition of human Kv2.1 channels by a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-791. In this study we have further explored the SC-791 action on ion channels and heartbeat in Drosophila, which lacks cyclooxygenases and thus can serve as a convenient model to study COX-2-independent mechanisms of coxibs. Using intracellular recordings in combination with a pharmacological approach and utilizing available Drosophila mutants, we found that SC-791 inhibited voltage-activated K+ and L-type Ca2+ channels in larval body-wall muscles and reduced heart rate in a concentration-dependent manner. Unlike celecoxib and several other K+ channel blockers, SC-791 did not induce arrhythmia. Instead, application of SC-791 resulted in a dramatic slowing of contractions and, at higher concentrations, in progressively weaker contractions with gradual cessation of heartbeat. Isradipine, a selective blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, showed a similar pattern of heart arrest, though no prolongation of contractions was observed. Ryanodine was the only channel modulating compound of those tested additionally that was capable of slowing contractions. Like SC-791, ryanodine reduced heart rate without arrhythmia. However, it could not stop heartbeat completely even at 500 µM, the highest concentration used. The magnitude of heart rate reduction, when SC-791 and ryanodine were applied together, was smaller than expected for independent mechanisms, raising the possibility that SC-791 might be interfering with excitation-contraction coupling in Drosophila heart.;No;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f7f44de57b167b8007d4c084cce035334aea2d3

Try special determine effort again.;ShortPaper;BACKGROUND, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin, and food additives (FAs) may exacerbate allergic symptoms in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). Augmentation of histamine release from human mast cells and basophils by those substances is speculated to be the cause of exacerbated allergic symptoms. We sought to investigate the mechanism of action of aspirin on IgE-mediated histamine release., , , METHODS, The effects of NSAIDs, FAs or cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors on histamine release from human basophils concentrated by gravity separation were evaluated., , , RESULTS, Benzoate and tartrazine, which have no COX inhibitory activity, augmented histamine release from basophils similar to aspirin. In contrast, ibuprofen, meloxicam, FR122047 and NS-398, which have COX inhibitory activity, did not affect histamine release. These results indicate that the augmentation of histamine release by aspirin is not due to COX inhibition. It was observed that aspirin augmented histamine release from human basophils only when specifically activated by anti-IgE antibodies, but not by A23187 or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. When the IgE receptor signaling pathway was activated, aspirin increased the phosphorylation of Syk. Moreover, patients with chronic urticaria and FDEIA tended to be more sensitive to aspirin as regards the augmentation of histamine release, compared with healthy controls., , , CONCLUSIONS, Aspirin enhanced histamine release from basophils via increased Syk kinase activation, and that the augmentation of histamine release by NSAIDs or FAs may be one possible cause of worsening symptoms in patients with chronic urticaria and FDEIA.;Yes;Yes;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ddcf9d34e3937c5878387c819b2044d781fc3955

Methods: An experimental, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study on 32 male Wistar rats was carried out. We examined the effect of diclofenac 4 mg/kg/day on the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme in the anastomotic tissue and on the breaking strength of anastomotic and incisional wounds. The operation was performed with colonic resection and hand-sewn anastomosis. After 3 days, the rats were sacrificed and the breaking strength and the COX-2 content of the anastomosis were measured. Results: There was a significantly reduced level of COX-2 in the rats treated with diclofenac (p = 0.001); no significant differences in any of the breaking strength measurements and no significant correlation between COX-2 levels and breaking strength of the anastomotic or incisional wounds could be found (p = 0.073 and p = 0.727). Conclusion: This study for the first time showed that a diclofenac dose of 4 mg/kg/24 h was sufficient to reduce the level of COX-2 enzymes in the anastomotic tissue in rats. This inhibition of the inflammatory response did not lead to reduced breaking strength of either anastomotic or incisional wounds. Whether there is a detrimental effect of COX inhibition on colorectal anastomoses in the clinical setting remains controversial.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/95e766f5f8cef3b013dcca1e44f1c219a8a89bb0

Because step best expert system ever. Section organization brother.;Poster;Fetal wound healing occurs rapidly and without scar formation early in gestation. Studying the mechanisms of scarless repair can lead to novel scar‐preventive approaches. In fetal wounds, collagen is deposited early and is fine and reticular with less cross‐linking. Several important differences of fetal vs. postgestational wound‐healing response have been determined, such as the presence of less inflammation, higher hyaluronic acid concentration and a greater ratio of collagen type III to type I. Compared with typical wounds, there are also altered ratios of signaling molecules, such as higher ratios of transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β3 to TGF‐β1 and ‐β2, and matrix metalloproteinases to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Furthermore, fetal fibroblasts do not exhibit TGF‐β1‐induced collagen production compared with their mature counterparts. Patterning genes (homeobox genes) involved in organogenesis are more active in the fetal period and are believed to be the “first domino” in the fetal cutaneous wound repair regulatory cascade. The recommended scar‐preventive agents, such as Scarguard MD®, silicone gel and sheet, Seprafilm® Bioresorbable Membrane, topical hyaluronan, onion extract, oral tamoxifen and 585‐nm pulsed dye laser are reviewed in this study. Despite the lack of supporting evidence, there is a widespread false presumption that the acceleration of healing with the widely assumed scar‐preventive commercial agents is associated with decreased scar formation. Humans are erroneously inclined to make a negative correlation between the healing rate and the degree of scar formation, while such a correlation does not exist in reality. Despite the importance of scar prevention, no FDA‐approved therapy for this purpose is available in the 21st century, which reflects the important challenges, such as the presence of redundant pathways, that these approaches are facing.;Yes;No;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/030045b715927e33beaff5a7e651b08ce34213d0

These include the prevention of immune suppression during the critical perioperative period, and the preclusion of direct promoting effects of catecholamines and prostaglandins on malignant tissue growth. To assess the safety of such pharmacological treatments in the context of oncologic surgery, the current study evaluates wound healing efficacy in the skin, muscle, and colon tissues in rats undergoing colonic anastomosis. Methods: F344 rats were treated daily with a COX-2 inhibitor (etodolac), a b-adrenergic blocker (propranolol), both drugs or vehicles. All rats underwent skin punch biopsy, and half were also subjected to laparotomy and colonic anastomosis. Tensile strength of the abdominal wall and colonic bursting pressure were assessed on Days 3, 7, and 30 postoperatively, and skin biopsy site healing was scored on Days 2, 4, and 6 postoperatively. Results: None of the drug treatments produced any deleterious effects along the expected course of tissue healing. On Day 30, colon bursting pressure showed an abnormal strengthening in animals undergoing anastomosis compared to non-operated animals, across all drug treatments. This abnormal strengthening was attenuated by etodolac. In the skin, surgery reduced healing rate, irrespective of drug treatments. Conclusions: Effective doses of etodolac and propranolol caused no negative effects on wound healing processes in rats. The apparent safety of such treatments, together with their potential clinical benefits, suggests the incorporation of these treatments in oncologic patients undergoing curative tumor resection.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96343f121828c9274ff1628004698e9a5435a16f

Nor people star suddenly Mr change high television.;DemoPaper;Augmented expression of protein kinase CK2 is associated with hyperproliferation and resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. Effects of CK2 are at least partially linked to signaling via the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, which is dramatically enhanced in colon cancer. Cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2), a Wnt/β‐catenin target gene, has been associated with enhanced cancer progression and metastasis. However, the possibility that a connection may exist between CK2 and COX‐2 has not been explored previously. Here we investigated changes in COX‐2 expression and activity upon CK2 modulation and evaluated how these changes affected cell viability. COX‐2 expression and cell viability decreased upon selective inhibition of COX‐2 with SC‐791 or CK2 with 2‐dimethylamino‐4,5,6,7‐tetrabromo‐1H‐benzimidazole (DMAT), both in human colon (HT29‐ATCC, HT29‐US, DLD‐1) and breast (ZR‐75) cancer cells, as well as in human embryonic kidney (HEK‐293T) cells. On the other hand, ectopic CK2α expression promoted up‐regulation of COX‐2 by activating the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway in HEK‐293T cells. Noteworthy, over‐expression of either CK2α, β‐catenin or COX‐2, as well as supplementation of the medium with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), all were individually sufficient to overcome limitations in cell viability triggered by CK2 inhibition either upon addition of DMAT or over‐expression of a dominant negative CK2α variant. Altogether, these findings provide new insight to the role of CK2 in cancer by up‐regulating COX‐2 expression and thereby PGE2 production. J. Cell.

Celecoxib was added to NIH/3T3 fibroblasts stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) or transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF‑β1). NIH/3T3 fibroblast proliferation and viability were assessed by MTT assays; ERK1/2 expression and SMAD2/3 expression were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The results indicated that celecoxib suppressed cell proliferation (IC50 FGF+ group, 75 ± 1.9 µmol/l) stimulated by FGF-2, and also inhibited cell viability (IC50 FGF- group, 252 ± 2.3 µmol/l) by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 expression. In addition, celecoxib treatment led to the apoptosis of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (IC50 FGF- group, 35 ± 1.4 µmol/l). Celecoxib also suppressed collagen expression (0.35-fold COL3 and 0.43-fold COL1 with 320 µmol/l celecoxib relative to the untreated group following stimulation for 3 h, p<0.01) when stimulated by TGF‑β1, by inhibiting SMAD2/3 phosphorylation but not SMAD2/3 expression.

However, the responsible molecular mechanisms of COX inhibition in breast cancer cells remain to be completely elucidated. We examined the effect of the selective COX-1 inhibitor, FR122047 and the selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC791 on cell growth and apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells which exhibited a high basal level of COX-1 expression. Compared to SC791, FR122047 treatment led to a distinct suppression of cell growth in MCF-7 cells. Upon FR122047 treatment, there were apparent increases in the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Our data showed that treatment of caspase-8 inhibitor could significantly suppress the cleavage of the effector caspase-7 and PARP in FR122047-treated MCF-7 cells which are caspase-3-deficient breast cancer cells, indicating that the induction of apoptosis by FR122047 is significantly dependent on caspase-8 activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Or environmental single nearly eight fear.;ShortPaper;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE, Elevated levels of prostaglandins contribute to periodontal destruction but can impair gingival healing by affecting local fibroblasts. Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has beneficial effects on supporting and gingival tissues. We showed that prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2) ) inhibits the proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) and that EMD stimulates it. Prostaglandins and EMD may also affect skin healing by targeting dermal fibroblasts (DFs). Thus, we compared the effects of these two agents on the proliferation of hGFs, human gingival keratinocytes (hGKs) and hDFs., , , MATERIAL AND METHODS, Cells from healthy human gingiva or skin were treated with PGE(2) and/or EMD, and proliferation was assessed by measuring cell number and DNA synthesis., , , RESULTS, In hGFs, PGE(2) (1 μm) inhibited proliferation while EMD stimulated it. When present together, EMD abolished the PGE(2) -induced inhibition. Serum increased (by a factor of 10) the amount of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), PGE(2) reduced it (by 70-80%) and EMD restored it when present with PGE(2). Prostaglandin E(2) stimulated cAMP production in hGFs while serum or EMD did not. Enamel matrix derivative stimulated hDF proliferation, but the inhibitory effect of PGE(2) was milder than with hGFs. When present together, EMD abolished the PGE(2) -induced inhibition. Enamel matrix derivative inhibited the proliferation of primary hGKs, but PGE(2) had no effect. Finally, we found that hDFs contained about five times less prostaglandin EP(2) receptor mRNA than hGFs, while hGKs contained none., , , CONCLUSION, Prostaglandin E(2) inhibits and EMD stimulates hGF proliferation via distinct pathways. The different sensitivities of hDFs and hGKs to PGE(2) can be explained by the levels of EP(2) expression.;Yes;No;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e986d4dc8c4ab7f84c0df74bc8d86f01f8ea5548

Using a murine incisional wound model, we evaluated the effects of SU6668, an inhibitor of the receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), on the healing of skin wounds. Mice were administered vehicle, SU6668 (100 or 400 mg/kg/day, b.i.d.), or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg/day, b.i.d.), and wound healing was monitored histologically and using a tensiometer. SU6668 at a fully efficacious dose of 100 mg/kg/day had no significant effect on the healing process, while at a supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg/kg/day, there were subtle transient histologic changes and slight decreases in tensile strength, suggesting a slight delay in the wound healing process. In conclusion, these data indicate that inhibition of the receptors for VEGF, PDGF, and FGF at levels necessary to inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenograft models does not affect the healing of incisional wounds in mice. Redundant pathways likely compensate for inhibition of VEGF, PDGF, and FGF signaling pathways in the skin healing process.;No;Yes;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d0a90a1efd7a0d466fbb6f25e42561e9d3077c9

Five rats in each treatment group were exposed to ischemic times of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours. Survival of the flap was assessed 7 days after reversal of the ischemia. Probit curves and the critical ischemic time were calculated. In the revascularization study, 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups of 15 rats each. One group was fed celecoxib, while the other was fed a normal diet. All rats had a 3 x 6-cm fasciocutaneous flap based on the inferior epigastric artery elevated and exposed to 2 hours of primary ischemia. The flap was then sutured back into the wound bed. Each of these groups was then divided into 3 groups of 5 rats whose pedicles were divided on postoperative day 5, 6, or 7. Percentage survival of the flap was measured 7 days later. In both parts of the study, the experimental group was fed celecoxib, 1500 ppm, throughout the interoperative period. In each animal, a 3 x 6-cm ventral fasciocutaneous groin flap based on the left superficial epigastric artery was elevated., , , RESULTS, In the ischemia study, respective flap survival rates from the control and celecoxib groups at the various ischemic times were as follows: 4 hours, 100% and 100%; 6 hours, 80% and 100%; 8 hours, 80% and 80%; 10 hours, 60% and 60%; and 12 hours, 20% and 10%. The median lethal ischemic times were 9.7 and 9.6 hours, respectively. There was no statistical difference in flap survival between the celecoxib and control groups. In the revascularization study, ligation of the flap pedicle on day 5, 6, or 7 did not result in any difference in the percentage of flap survival among the 3 groups., , , CONCLUSION, Celecoxib appears to have no deleterious effect on free tissue transfer survival or healing, as evidenced by revascularization in a fasciocutaneous free flap model.;No;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c562bf8853ad48378356c184c5e4aadac7421852

Paper her company really station executive.;DemoPaper;An essential feature of a healed wound is the restoration of an intact epidermal barrier through wound epithelialization, also known as re-epithelialization. The directed migration of keratinocytes is critical to wound epithelialization and defects in this function are associated with the clinical phenotype of chronic non-healing wounds. A complex balance of signaling factors and surface proteins are expressed and regulated in a temporospatial manner that promote keratinocyte motility and survival to activate wound re-epithelialization. The majority of this review focuses on the mechanisms that regulate keratinocyte migration in the re-epithelialization process. This includes a review of cell attachments via desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and integrins, the expression of keratins, the role of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, eicosanoids, oxygen tension, antimicrobial peptides, and matrix metalloproteinases. Also reviewed are recently emerging novel mediators of keratinocyte motility including the role of electric fields, and signaling via the acetylcholine and beta-adrenergic receptors. These multiple regulators impact the ability of keratinocytes to migrate from the wound edge or other epidermal reservoirs to efficiently re-epithelialize a breach in the integrity of the epidermis. New discoveries will continue to uncover the elegant network of events that result in restoration of epidermal integrity and complete the wound repair process.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80298ae0a69257a550fbad61041a107bc02cd6f8

Results: A comprehensive review of the pathophysiology of scarring and scar management, including both emerging and currently available therapies, was completed. Current clinical studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of well-designed controls, and lack of standardized scar outcome measurement parameters. Conclusions: A prominent challenge in the study of scar management is the paucity of well-designed, large, randomized, controlled studies examining existing scar-reducing techniques. The greatest improvement in scar-reducing protocols likely entails a polytherapeutic strategy for management. Further investigation into the role of inflammation in scarring is paramount to the development of improved scar-reducing agents. There is a need for large controlled trials using a polytherapeutic strategy that combines existing and novel agents to provide a standardized evidence-based evaluation of efficacy.;No;Yes;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c7e0275186f8f13367fc5eafb48abcebf4f8f79

Casualties of radiation dispersal devices, nuclear detonation or major ionizing radiation accidents, in addition to radiation exposure, may sustain physical and/or thermal trauma. Radiation exposure plus additional tissue trauma is known as combined injury. There are no definitive therapeutic agents. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible enzyme expressed in pathological disorders and radiation injury, plays an important role in inflammation and the production of cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and could therefore affect the outcome for victims of combined injury. The COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and meloxicam were evaluated for their therapeutic value against combined injury in mice. In survival studies, the COX-2 inhibitors had no beneficial effect on 30-day survival, wound healing or body weight gain after radiation injury alone or after combined injury. Meloxicam accelerated death in both wounded and combined injury mice. These drugs also induced severe hepatic toxicity, exaggerated inflammatory processes, and did not enhance hematopoietic cell regeneration. This study points to potential contraindications for use of COX-2 inhibitors in patients undergoing therapy for radiation injury and combined injury.;Yes;Yes;2009;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70f33f273bed73b6c0d1df42e2de528f3c0a6391

We investigated the influence of diclofenac, a non-selective NSAID, on incisional wound healing., , , METHOD, Ten male Wistar rats were given 5 mg diclofenac per kg bodyweight per day; 10 rats were given placebo pellets. After 10 days, unimpaired healing occurred independently of drug treatment both macroscopically and microscopically. Histomorphometry revealed a significant reduction (p = 0.006) in fibroblasts after diclofenac application (median 3 166 cells per mm2) compared with the placebo group (median 3940 cells per mm2). Epidermal thickness was not statistically different between the two groups., , , RESULTS, Diclofenac diminished the amount of fibroblasts in connective tissue, reflecting the known antiproliferative effect of NSAIDs on fibroblasts. Clinical healing was not affected., , , CONCLUSION, We recommend short-term diclofenac application for post-surgical and post-traumatic patients with wounds who would benefit from its antiphlogistic and analgesic effect. However, if wound healing is disturbed, the negative effect of diclofenac on fibroblasts should be considered. This is particularly relevant for patients with chronic wounds or conditions such as diabetes which can delay wound healing.;Yes;No;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/071231fc274b7efbc8fabc80a05d7084d0d2def8

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 expression and activity were severely dysregulated in chronic wounds of diabetic ob/ob mice. Those wounds were characterized by a reduced expression of COX-1 and the presence of strongly elevated levels of COX-2 when compared with conditions observed in healthy animals. Resolution of the diabetic and impaired wound-healing phenotype by systemic administration of leptin into ob/ob mice increased COX-1 expression in wound margin keratinocytes and decreased COX-2 expression in inner wound areas to levels found in wild-type animals. Notably, improved wound healing was characterized by a marked increase in PGE2/PGD2 biosynthesis that colocalized with induced COX-1 in new tissue at the margin of the wound. COX-2 expression did not significantly contribute to PGE2/PGD2 production in impaired wound tissue. Accordingly, only late wound tissue from SC-560-treated (selective COX-1 inhibitor) but not celecoxib-treated (selective COX-2 inhibitor) ob/ob mice exhibited a severe loss in PGE2, PGD2, and prostacyclin at the wound site, and this change was associated with reduced keratinocyte numbers in the neo-epithelia. These data constitute strong evidence that a dysregulation of COX-1-coupled prostaglandin contributes to diabetes-impaired wound healing.;Yes;No;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91a4e306c11b1de66063d8bacc972b057767242f

Summary and Background Data:Intra-abdominal adhesions are the major cause of intestinal obstruction and secondary infertility after surgical procedures. Because adhesion synthesis requires angiogenesis, and cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2) inhibitors have antiendothelial activity, we tested COX-2 inhibitors in a murine model of intra-abdominal adhesion formation. Methods:A silicone patch was secured to the lateral abdominal wall of groups of C57BL/6 mice, followed by cecal abrasion to promote adhesion formation. Beginning on the day of surgery, mice were treated with the selective COX-2 agents, celecoxib or rofecoxib, and the nonspecific COX inhibitors, aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, or indomethacin. Animals were treated for 10 days and killed. A second group (celecoxib, rofecoxib, aspirin) was treated for 10 days and observed for an additional 25 days. After treatment, intra-abdominal adhesions were scored using a standard method. The patch was subjected to immunohistochemistry with the endothelial-specific marker, CD31. Results:Animals treated with selective and nonselective COX-2 inhibitors, except aspirin, had significantly fewer adhesions than control animals. Celecoxib produced a maximal reduction in adhesion formation compared with rofecoxib and the nonselective COX-2 inhibitors at 10 days. After 25 days, celecoxib and rofecoxib, but not aspirin, had fewer adhesions than control mice. Adhesions from mice treated with celecoxib had reduced microvessel density compared with rofecoxib, the nonselective COX inhibitors, and control animals. Conclusions:Selective COX-2 inhibitors, in particular celecoxib, provide durable inhibition of intra-abdominal adhesions through an antiangiogenic mechanism.;Yes;No;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbb10ca68c5b3f47d3dff6e471f3b8ffd64989ff

Military from little million chair player.;FullPaper;Patients with various rheumatologic and inflammatory disease states commonly require drugs known to decrease the inflammatory or autoimmune response for adequate control of their condition. Such drugs include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase (COX)‐2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic response modifiers. These drugs affect inflammation and local immune responses, which are necessary for proper wound healing in the perioperative setting, thereby potentially resulting in undesirable postoperative complications. Such complications include wound dehiscence, infection, and impaired collagen synthesis. The end result is delayed healing of soft tissue and bone wounds. The current literature provides insight into the effect of some of these drugs on wound healing. For certain drugs, such as methotrexate, trials have been conducted in humans and direct us on what to do during the perioperative period. Whereas with other drugs, we must rely on either small‐animal studies or extrapolation of data from human studies that did not specifically look at wound healing. Unfortunately, no clear consensus exists on the need and optimum time for withholding therapy before surgery. Likewise, clinicians are often uncertain of the appropriate time to resume therapy after the procedure. For those drugs with limited or no data in this setting, the use of pharmacokinetic properties and biologic effects of each drug should be considered individually. In some cases, discontinuation of therapy may be required up to 4 weeks before surgery because of the long half‐lives of the drugs. In doing so, patients may experience an exacerbation or worsening of disease. Clinicians must carefully evaluate individual patient risk factors, disease severity, and the pharmacokinetics of available therapies when weighing the risks and benefits of discontinuing therapy in the perioperative setting.;Yes;No;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a36c6587b858e107cc16080b1c600cf831a38524

Selective inhibitors of COX‐2, such as celecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib have been developed and the greatest recent growth in our knowledge in this area has been come from the clinical use of these compounds. Although clinical data indicate that COX‐2 selectivity is associated with a reduction in severe gastrointestinal events, they also reveal there are roles for constitutive COX‐2 within tissues such as the brain, kidney, pancreas, intestine, and blood vessels. We now better understand the roles of COX‐1 and COX‐2 in functions as disparate as the perception of pain and the progression of cancers. Clinical use of COX‐2‐selective compounds has ignited strong debates regarding potential side effects, most notably those within the cardiovascular system such as myocardial infarctions, strokes, and elevation in blood pressure. This review will discuss how the latest studies help us understand the roles of COX‐1 and COX‐2 and what clinically proven benefits the newer generation of COX‐2‐selective inhibitors offer.—Warner, T.

The changes in microcirculation during sepsis can be explained by the alterations in the endothelial barrier function. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a potential recovery index of endothelial function and it an increase in response to neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was demonstrated. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of NMES in patients with septic shock. Methods and analysis: It is a study protocol for a randomized cross-over design in an intensive care unit of a tertiary University hospital. Thirty-one patients aged 18 to 65 years. The study will be divided in 2 phases: the phase one will be held in the first 72 hours of septic shock and the phase two after 3 days of first assessment. Patients will be randomly selected to the intervention protocol (decubitus position with the limbs raised and NMES) and control protocol (decubitus position with the limbs raised without NMES). After this procedure, the patients will be allocated in group 1 (intervention and control protocol) or group 2 (control and intervention protocol) with a wash-out period of 4 to 6 hours between them. The main outcome is mobilization of EPCs. The secondary outcome is metabolic and hemodynamic data.

Current animal- and human-based research and literature were evaluated to provide an overview of thermal burn classification and the pathophysiology of burn shock and smoke inhalation injury., , , ETIOLOGY, Severe burn injury, burn shock, and smoke inhalation injury may be encountered as a result of thermal injury, radiation injury, chemical injury, or electrical injury., , , DIAGNOSIS, Burns can be subdivided based on the amount of total body surface area (TBSA) involved and the depth of the burn. Local burn injuries involve <20% of the TBSA whereas SBI involves >20-30% of the TBSA. The modern burn classification system classifies burns by increasing depth: superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, and full-thickness., , , SUMMARY, Local burn injury rarely leads to systemic illness whereas SBI leads to significant metabolic derangements that require immediate and intensive management. SBI results in a unique derangement of cardiovascular dysfunction known as "burn shock." The physiologic changes that occur with SBI can be divided into 2 distinct phases; the resuscitation phase and the hyperdynamic hypermetabolic phase. The resuscitation phase occurs immediately following SBI and lasts for approximately 24-72 hours. This period of hemodynamic instability is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators, increased vascular permeability, reduced cardiac output, and edema formation. The hyperdynamic hypermetabolic phase begins approximately 3-5 days after injury. This phase is characterized by hyperdynamic circulation and an increased metabolic rate that can persist up to 24 months post burn injury in people.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb4c20828999a3f25d34befcff3ec428cd272f3e

Despite human cAVM tissues having a minor population of ECs, they play an important role in the manifestation and development of cAVM as well as in hemorrhagic stroke and thrombogenesis. To characterize and understand the biology of ECs in human cAVM (cAVM-ECs), methods for the isolation and purification of these cells are necessary. We have developed this method to reliably obtain pure populations of ECs from cAVMs. To obtain pure cell populations, cAVM tissues were mechanically and enzymatically digested and the resulting single cAVM-ECs suspensions were then labeled with antibodies of specific cell antigens and selected by flow cytometry. Purified ECs were detected using specific makers of ECs by immunostaining and used to study different cellular mechanisms. Compared to the different methods of isolating ECs from tissues, we could isolate ECs from cAVMs confidently, and the numbers of cAVM-ECs harvested were almost similar to the amounts present in vessel components. In addition to optimizing the protocol for isolation of ECs from human cAVM tissues, the protocol could also be applied to isolate ECs from other human neurovascular-diseased tissues. Depending on the tissues, the whole procedure could be completed in about 20 days.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014f5c0314e3644a6f884c2fdb5d2a1dbc5a66a9

We investigated the roles of prostaglandins and inflammation-resolving mediators in naturally occurring equine tendon injury with disease stage and age. Levels of prostaglandins E2 (PGE2), F2α (PGF2α), lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and its receptor FPR2/ALX were analysed in extracts of normal, sub-acute and chronic injured tendons. To assess whether potential changes were associated with altered PGE2 metabolism, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH), COX-2 and EP4 receptor expression were investigated. The ability of tendons to resolve inflammation was determined by assessing FPR2/ALX expression in natural injury and IL-1β stimulated tendon explants. Alterations in the profile of lipid mediators during sub-acute injury included low PGE2 and elevated LXA4 levels compared to normal and chronic injuries. In contrast, PGF2α levels remained unchanged and were three-fold lower than PGE2. The synthetic capacity of PGE2 as measured by the ratio of mPGES-1:PGDH was elevated in sub-acute injury, suggesting aberrations in tendon prostaglandin metabolism, whilst COX-2 and EP4 receptor were unchanged. Paradoxically low tendon PGE2 levels in early injury may be attributed to increased local clearance via PGDH or the class switching of lipid mediators from the prostaglandin to the lipoxin axis. PGE2 is therefore implicated in the development of tendon inflammation and its ensuing resolution. Whilst there was no relationship between age and tendon LXA4 levels, there was an age-associated decline in FPR2/ALX receptor expression with concurrent increased PGE2 levels in injury. Furthermore, uninjured tendon explants from younger (<10 years) but not older horses (≥10 years) treated with IL-1β responded by increasing FPR2/ALX suggesting aged individuals exhibit a reduced capacity to resolve inflammation via FPR2/ALX, which may present a potential mechanism for development of chronic tendinopathy and re-injury.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63213f9f3b12bbe1126c01938f7bb147501c53b7

Democratic class kid.;DemoPaper;Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyzes the breakdown of the essential amino acid tryptophan into kynurenine, is understood to have a key role in cancer immunotherapy. IDO has also received more attention because of its non-immune functions including regulating angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of IDO on microvessel density (MVD), and to explore its prognostic role in breast cancer. We showed IDO expression was positively correlated with MVD labeled by CD105 (MVD-CD105) rather than MVD labeled by CD31 (MVD-CD31) in breast cancer specimens. Both IDO expression and MVD-CD105 level were associated with initial TNM stage, histological grade, and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) metastasis in breast cancer. In the prognostic analysis, TDLNs metastasis, an advanced TNM stage (III) and high histological grade (III) significantly predicted shorter survival in univariate analysis. Concentrating on IDO and MVD, the patients with IDO expression or high MVD level had poorer prognosis compared with no IDO expression [P = 0.047 for progress-free survival (PFS)] and low MVD level (P = 0.019 for OS); the patients with IDO expression and high MVD level had a tendency with shorter overall survival when compared with non IDO expression, low MVD level, or both (P = 0.062 for OS). In multivariate analysis, an advanced TNM stage (III) was significantly associated with shorter 5-year survival rate of PFS (HR: 0.126, 95% CI: 0.024–0.669, P = 0.015). In order to verify the phenomenon of IDO promoting angiogenesis, we contained the study in vitro. We detected the expression of IDO mRNA in breast cancer cell lines and measured the concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine in the supernatants of MCF-7 by high performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of Kyn and trp (kyn/trp) was calculated to estimate IDO-enzyme activity. MCF-7 cells, which produce high level of IDO and metabolize tryptophan, promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation significantly in co-culture system. Meanwhile IDO could upregulate the expression of CD105 in HUVEC, which was downregulated after adding IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl-d-trytophan. These results suggest that IDO could promote angiogenesis in breast cancer, providing a novel, potentially effective molecular or gene therapy target for angiogenesis inhibition in the future.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/171a9fa03002b909fc8c4eca3bd0ec61ec6884c1

This study aimed to investigate the differential expression of 40 inflammatory mediators in patients with CP/CPPS and to demonstrate whether these mediators related to the severity of erectile function. Eighty cases of patients with CP/CPPS were selected, including 40 cases of IIIA and 40 cases of IIIB, with 20 cases of healthy men as controls. After collecting their expressed prostatic secretion, cytokines levels in EPS were determined by ELISA using ELISA kits. The IIEF‐5 questionnaire was used to evaluate erectile function. IIEF‐5 scores were significantly lower in the IIIA and IIIB groups than those in the control group. The expression of IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 was markedly higher in the IIIA and IIIB groups than in the control group. The expression of IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 in the IIIA group was higher than that in the IIIB group. The expression of IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 was negatively correlated with IIEF‐5 scores in both IIIA and IIIB patients. In conclusion, IL‐8, IL‐1β and ICAM‐1 are possible indicators for the clinical diagnosis of CP/CPPS and evaluation of erectile function on patients with CP/CPPS.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a57a17f722481f3598361a7be074e69d536ba7

The aim of this study was to evaluate the methanol crude extract and various fractions of increasing polarity of J. mimosifolia leaves for bioactive metabolites, as well as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. The anti-inflammatory potential of the various fractions of J. mimosifolia leaf extract was studied via the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay. Methanol crude extract (ME), derived fractions extracted with chloroform (CF) and ethyl acetate (EAF), and residual aqueous extract (AE) of dried J. mimosifolia leaves were assayed for polyphenolic compounds, their antioxidant, antimicrobial and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activities, and anticancer properties. Polyphenolic compounds were determined via HPLC while phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and ortho-diphenol contents), antioxidant activities (DPPH, hydrogen peroxideperoxide, hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions) and LOX were measured via spectrophotometry. Methanol extracts and various fractions were evaluated for antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antifungal potential of the fractions was tested against three species: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest values for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonols, tannins and ortho-diphenols were in the ME, followed by CF > EAF > AE. ME also had the highest antioxidant activity with EC50 values 48±1.3, 45±2.4, 42±1.3 and 46±1.3 μg/mL based on the DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical assays, respectively. TPC and TFC showed a significant, strong and positive correlation with the values for each of these antioxidant activities. ME exhibited anti-inflammatory potential based on its LOX inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.3 μg/mL). ME also had the maximum antibacterial and antifungal potential, followed by EAF > CF > AE. Furthermore, ME showed the strongest cytotoxic effect (EC50 = 10.7 and 17.3 μg/mL) against human hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma (LnCaP) and human lung carcinoma (LU-1) cell lines, respectively. Bioactive compounds present in leaf methanol extracts of J. mimosifolia were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Fifteen compounds were identified including phenolic and alcoholic compounds, as well as fatty acids. Our results suggest that J. mimosifolia leaves are a good source of natural products with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties for potential therapeutic, nutraceutical and functional food applications.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab285a281e113b6331c0bf1d7646f1054b2f81dd

Epidermal injury results in transient hyperplasia and induction of COX-2 expression. The role of COX-2 in this hyperplasia is unknown, however. In this study, we characterized the epidermal expression of COX isozymes following wounding by abrasion in SKH-1 mice using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and Western analysis. In addition, we evaluated pivotal keratinocyte functions necessary for the reparative hyperplasia, including proliferation by 5-bromo-2′deoxy-uridine labeling and differentiation by the expression of involucrin, keratin 1, and keratin 6. Although COX-1 expression in keratinocytes remained unchanged during wound healing, COX-2 expression was induced coincidentally with keratinocyte proliferation and keratin 6 expression, suggesting a role for COX-2 in epidermal repair. The role of COX-2 was also evaluated using the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-791 and the traditional COX inhibitors indomethacin and diclofenac. Neither inhibitor altered keratinocyte proliferation or differentiation following abrasion, in contrast to dexamethasone, which delayed these responses. Our results indicated that, although COX-2 expression was coincident with transient epidermal hyperplasia and keratinocyte proliferation/differentiation during the healing of epidermal injury, it does not play a pivotal role in this repair process.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7e5a13c5a1ebb5895230026128681b518828d706

Edge ability good financial century.;Poster;The cyclooxygenase isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, are involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2, a major prostaglandin involved in epidermal homeostasis and repair. Cancer originating in the epidermis can develop when keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis become dysregulated, resulting in sustained epidermal hyperplasia. COX-2 inhibitors, which demonstrate significant in vivo selectivity relative to COX-1, suppress both ultraviolet-induced epidermal tumor development and progression, suggesting that prostaglandin regulation of keratinocyte biology is involved in the pathogenesis of epidermal neoplasia. In this study, we characterized the expression of COX-1 and COX-2, as well as keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, following acute ultraviolet irradiation in the hairless SKH-1 mouse. Following acute ultraviolet exposure, COX-2 expression was predominantly induced in the basal keratinocyte layer coincident with an increase in keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis. The role of COX-2 was further evaluated using a selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC-791, as well as the traditional nonsteroidal COX inhibitor, indomethacin. Following acute ultraviolet irradiation, inhibition of COX-2 with either inhibitor decreased epidermal keratinocyte proliferation. Likewise, keratinocyte apoptosis was increased with COX-2 inhibition, particularly in the proliferating basal keratinocyte layer. There was also a modest inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation. These data suggest that COX-2 expression is probably necessary for keratinocyte survival and proliferation occurring after acute ultraviolet irradiation. We hypothesize that selective COX-2 inhibition, as described herein, may lead to enhanced removal of ultraviolet-damaged keratinocytes, thereby decreasing malignant transformation in the epidermis.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5e952824f03a8ccb7af269818a84abc124350a7

Alone truth international police record look development. City several Mr forward others.;Poster;New insights into the cellular and extra-cellular composition of scar tissue after myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. Recently, a heterogeneous podoplanin-expressing cell population has been associated with fibrogenic and inflammatory responses and lymphatic vessel growth during scar formation. Podoplanin is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in heart development, cell motility, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. In the adult mouse heart, podoplanin is expressed only by cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells; after MI, it is acquired with an unexpected heterogeneity by PDGFRα-, PDGFRβ-, and CD34-positive cells. Podoplanin may therefore represent a sign of activation of a cohort of progenitor cells during different phases of post-ischemic myocardial wound repair. Podoplanin binds to C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) which is exclusively expressed by platelets and a variety of immune cells. CLEC-2 is upregulated in CD11bhigh cells, including monocytes and macrophages, following inflammatory stimuli. We recently published that inhibition of the interaction between podoplanin-expressing cells and podoplanin-binding cells using podoplanin-neutralizing antibodies reduces but does not fully suppress inflammation post-MI while improving heart function and scar composition after ischemic injury. These data support an emerging and alternative mechanism of interactome in the heart that, when neutralized, leads to altered inflammatory response and preservation of cardiac function and structure. The overarching objective of this review is to assimilate and discuss the available evidence on the functional role of podoplanin-positive cells on cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. A detailed characterization of cell-to-cell interactions and paracrine signals between podoplanin-expressing cells and the other type of cells that compose the heart tissue is needed to open a new line of investigation extending beyond the known function of these cells. This review attempts to discuss the role and biology of podoplanin-positive cells in the context of cardiac injury, repair, and remodeling.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77389f04e20f4e5919bbcdc77244f6597a33c73f

Defects in placental vasculature and trophoblast have been identified in several pregnancy complications. Thus, the detailed molecular profile and heterogeneity of endothelial cells and trophoblasts in placentas will aid us in better understanding placental behaviors and improving pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to profile the transcriptomics of human placental villous tissues from eleven patients with normal pregnancies in the first and second trimesters (6–16 weeks of gestation). Results: The transcriptomic landscape of 52,179 single cells was obtained, and the cells were classified as trophoblasts, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, erythroid cells, Hofbauer cells, and macrophages. Our analysis further revealed the three subtypes of placental endothelial cells, with distinct metabolic signatures and transcription factor regulatory networks. We also determined the transcriptomic features of the trophoblast subpopulations and characterized two distinct populations of progenitor cells in cytotrophoblasts, which were capable of differentiating to extravillous trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, respectively. Conclusions: Our study provided a high-resolution molecular profile of the human placenta between 6 and 16 weeks of gestation. Our data revealed the placental cell complexity and demonstrated the transcriptional networks and signaling involved in placental endothelial and trophoblast differentiation during early pregnancy, which will be a resource for future studies of the human placental development.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e80eb18f2858212384bcd8f7db1c1dc91e5f5010

An emerging body of evidence indicates that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, independent of other conventional cardiometabolic comorbidities. Although most studies focus on the relationship between NAFLD and atrial fibrillation, associations with ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac conduction defects have also been reported. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a number of NAFLD-related pathophysiological alterations may potentially elicit structural, electrical, and autonomic remodeling in the heart, contributing to arrhythmogenic substrates in the heart. NAFLD is now the most common liver and metabolic disease in the world. However, the upsurge in the prevalence of NAFLD as an emerging risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias has received little attention. In this review, we summarize the clinical evidence and putative pathophysiological mechanisms for the emerging roles of NAFLD in cardiac arrhythmias, with the purpose of highlighting the notion that NAFLD may serve as an independent risk factor and a potential driving force in the development and progression of cardiac arrhythmias.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1a17e707931f02e9a305611866e5d5c10f6de9e

Source our those college carry pick question., Girl paper forward positive.;Poster;Human stems cells have sparked many novel strategies for treating heart disease and for elucidating their underlying mechanisms. For example, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disorder that is associated with fatal arrhythmias often occurring in healthy young adults. Fibro‐fatty infiltrate, a clinical hallmark, progresses with the disease and can develop across both ventricles. Pathogenic variants in genes have been identified, with most being responsible for encoding cardiac desmosome proteins that reside at myocyte boundaries that are critical for cell‐to‐cell coupling. Despite some understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms associated with ARVC mutations, their relationship with arrhythmogenesis is complex and not well understood for a monogenetic disorder. This review article focuses on arrhythmia mechanisms in ARVC based on clinical and animal studies and their relationship with disease causing variants. We also discuss the ways in which stem cells can be leveraged to improve our understanding of the role cardiac myocytes, nonmyocytes, metabolic signals, and inflammatory mediators play in an early onset disease such as ARVC.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f0f9f145e38f4e4bde9facbfa27c2b4b93c87cd

The major mechanism for activation of PGE(2)-synthesizing enzymes is transcriptional upregulation. The triphasic febrile response of Wistar-Kyoto rats to intravenous LPS (50 microg/kg) was studied. Using real-time RT-PCR, the expression of seven PGE(2)-synthesizing enzymes in the LPS-processing organs (liver and lungs) and the brain "febrigenic center" (hypothalamus) was quantified. Phase I involved transcriptional upregulation of the functionally coupled cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and microsomal (m) PGE synthase (PGES) in the liver and lungs. Phase II entailed robust upregulation of all enzymes of the major inflammatory pathway, i.e., secretory (s) phospholipase (PL) A(2)-IIA --> COX-2 --> mPGES, in both the periphery and brain. Phase III was accompanied by the induction of cytosolic (c) PLA(2)-alpha in the hypothalamus, further upregulation of sPLA(2)-IIA and mPGES in the hypothalamus and liver, and a decrease in the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in all tissues studied. Neither sPLA(2)-V nor cPGES was induced by LPS. The high magnitude of upregulation of mPGES and sPLA(2)-IIA (1,257-fold and 133-fold, respectively) makes these enzymes attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapy.;Yes;Yes;2002;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3292ec0e544fded990f49f47f6b933ddd5bf61a

Its inactivation occurs in peripheral tissues, primarily the lungs and liver, via carrier-mediated cellular uptake and enzymatic oxidation. We hypothesized that inactivation of PGE(2) is suppressed during LPS fever and that transcriptional downregulation of PGE(2) carriers and catabolizing enzymes contributes to this suppression. Fever was induced in inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats by intravenous LPS (50 microg/kg); the controls received saline. Samples of the liver, lungs, and hypothalamus were harvested 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 h postinjection. The expression of the two principal transmembrane PGE(2) carriers (PG transporter and multispecific organic anion transporter) and the two key PGE(2)-inactivating enzymes [15-hydroxy-PG dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and carbonyl reductase] was quantified by RT-PCR. All four genes of interest were downregulated in peripheral tissues (but not the brain) during fever. Most remarkably, the expression of hepatic 15-PGDH was decreased 26-fold 5 h post-LPS, whereas expression of pulmonary 15-PGDH was downregulated (as much as 18-fold) throughout the entire febrile course. The transcriptional downregulation of several proteins involved in PGE(2) inactivation, first reported here, is an unrecognized mechanism of systemic inflammation. By increasing the blood-brain gradient of PGE(2), this mechanism likely facilitates penetration of PGE(2) into the brain and prevents its elimination from the brain.;Yes;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/651dffc7ea281910f5aa15f4b0c16f4ec1dc2887

Range or white often number spend interview. Trade clearly serve one.;ShortPaper;Background Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation is prevalent in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with poor outcomes. Recent evidence suggests that the exaggerated host immune-inflammatory response characterizing the disease, specifically interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase, may have an important role, possibly via direct effects on cardiac electrophysiology. The aim of this study was to dissect the short-term discrete impact of IL-6 elevation on QTc in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods We investigated the following mechanisms: (1) the QTc duration in patients with COVID-19 during the active phase and recovery, and its association with C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels; (2) the acute impact of IL-6 administration on QTc in an in vivo guinea pig model; and (3) the electrophysiological effects of IL-6 on ventricular myocytes in vitro. Results In patients with active severe COVID-19 and elevated IL-6 levels, regardless of acute myocardial injury/strain and concomitant QT-prolonging risk factors, QTc was significantly prolonged and rapidly normalized in correlation with IL-6 decrease. The direct administration of IL-6 in an in vivo guinea pig model acutely prolongs QTc duration. Moreover, ventricular myocytes incubated in vitro with IL-6 show evident prolongation in the action potential, along with significant inhibition in the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr). Conclusion For the first time, we demonstrated that in severe COVID-19, systemic inflammatory activation can per se promote QTc prolongation via IL-6 elevation, leading to ventricular electric remodeling. Despite being transitory, such modifications may significantly contribute to arrhythmic events and associated poor outcomes in COVID-19. These findings provide a further rationale for current anti-inflammatory treatments for COVID-19, including IL-6-targeted therapies.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dea2294573bfc36b9fefac68dc0157245972a8a

Phone network officer brother.;Tough ok law Mr. Sure while national statement heavy exactly yes.;FullPaper;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a form of sustained cardiac arrhythmia and microRNAs (miRs) play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of AF. To identify novel miR–mRNA pairs, we performed RNA-seq from atrial biopsies of persistent AF patients and non-AF patients with normal sinus rhythm (SR). Differentially expressed miRs (11 down and 9 up) and mRNAs (95 up and 82 down) were identified and hierarchically clustered in a heat map. Subsequently, GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were run to identify deregulated pathways. Then, miR targets were predicted in the miRDB database, and a regulatory network of negatively correlated miR–mRNA pairs was constructed using Cytoscape. To select potential candidate genes from GSEA analysis, the top-50 enriched genes in GSEA were overlaid with predicted targets of differentially deregulated miRs. Further, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of enriched genes in GSEA was constructed, and subsequently, GO and canonical pathway analyses were run for genes in the PPI network. Our analyses showed that TNF-α, p53, EMT, and SYDECAN1 signaling were among the highly affected pathways in AF samples. SDC-1 (SYNDECAN-1) was the top-enriched gene in p53, EMT, and SYDECAN1 signaling. Consistently, SDC-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in atrial samples of AF patients. Among negatively correlated miRs, miR-302b-3p was experimentally validated to suppress SDC-1 transcript levels. Overall, our results suggested that the miR-302b-3p/SDC-1 axis may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1cf5824fba63c75243a967c56f5ebd2307303a5

Public about yeah sell later general pick service.;ShortPaper;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetic disorder of desmosomal and structural proteins that is characterized by fibro-fatty infiltrate in the ventricles and fatal arrhythmia that can occur early before significant structural abnormalities. Most ARVC mutations interfere with β-catenin–dependent transcription that enhances adipogenesis; however, the mechanistic pathway to arrhythmogenesis is not clear. We hypothesized that adipogenic conditions play an important role in the formation of arrhythmia substrates in ARVC. Cardiac myocyte monolayers co-cultured for 2–4 days with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells with the ARVC5 TMEM43 p.Ser358Leu mutation. The TMEM43 mutation in myocyte co-cultures alone had no significant effect on impulse conduction velocity (CV) or APD. In contrast, when co-cultures were exposed to pro-adipogenic factors for 2–4 days, CV and APD were significantly reduced compared to controls by 49% and 31%, respectively without evidence of adipogenesis. Additionally, these arrhythmia substrates coincided with a significant reduction in IGF-1 expression in MSCs and were mitigated by IGF-1 treatment. These findings suggest that the onset of enhanced adipogenic signaling may be a mechanism of early arrhythmogenesis, which could lead to personalized treatment for arrhythmias associated with TMEM43 and other ARVC mutations.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/347f6a7c418d0a45b79f052e1404145d82a1ade4

Adult modern peace crime allow thank.;Poster;Some trauma patients’ monocytes (MO) increase TNF-α levels concomitant to augmenting production of the TNF-α inhibitor prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suggesting posttrauma MO insensitivity to PGE2 effects. This study assesses additional posttrauma MO PGE2 insensitivity effects on altering TNF-α form (membrane versus secreted), down-regulating MO receptor expression, and depressing MO APC function. Posttrauma MO TNF-α insensitivity to exogenous and autocrine PGE2 correlated to accumulation of TNF-α primarily as a membrane-bound cytokine (mTNF-α). MO retention of mTNF-α correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and loss of antigen-presenting cell (APC) function as assessed by depressed MLR and dendritic cell (DC) differentiation. MO TNF-α sensitivity to down-regulation by IL-10 was retained, suggesting that PGE2-related functions are specifically altered in these patients’ MO. Freshly isolated MO from all trauma patients had decreased expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) for gram-negative bacteria. Exogenous PGE2 at high (10−6M) or low (10−8M) concentrations decreased normals’ and further decreased APC-competent patients’ MO TLR4 expression but had no effect on TLR2. Patients’ APC-dysfunctional MO failed to further down-regulate their TLR4 expression in response to additional PGE2, demonstrating another form of PGE2 insensitivity. One of the primary MO prostaglandin receptors, eicosanoid receptor 4 (EP4), was decreased on patients’ APC dysfunctional MO, suggesting that depressed EP4 expression could contribute to PGE2 insensitivity in patients’ MO. The APC dysfunctional MO’s dysregulation of TLR4 expression paralleled increased macrophage-like characteristics such as increased CD64 expression density, elevated mTNF-α production, and increased PGE2 levels. Increased PGE2 levels still decreased patients’ MO APC functions but failed to depress either MO TLR4 expression or mTNF-α levels, suggesting differential involvement of EP receptors in postinjury PGE2-mediated effects.;Yes;Yes;2004;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11f85f8da99fb45dd5290bef644e9e75666286a6

Background: The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), known to remodel in disease and have an extensive secretome, has recently been isolated from the human heart. However, the effects of normal and diseased cardiac MSCs on myocyte electrophysiology remain unclear. We hypothesize that in disease the inflammatory secretome of cardiac human MSCs (hMSCs) remodels and can regulate arrhythmia substrates. Methods: hMSCs were isolated from patients with or without heart failure from tissue attached to extracted device leads and from samples taken from explanted/donor hearts. Failing hMSCs or nonfailing hMSCs were cocultured with normal human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Using fluorescent indicators, action potential duration, Ca2+ alternans, and spontaneous calcium release (SCR) incidence were determined. Results: Failing and nonfailing hMSCs from both sources exhibited similar trilineage differentiation potential and cell surface marker expression as bone marrow hMSCs. Compared with nonfailing hMSCs, failing hMSCs prolonged action potential duration by 24% (P<0.001, n=15), increased Ca2+ alternans by 300% (P<0.001, n=18), and promoted spontaneous calcium release activity (n=14, P<0.013) in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Failing hMSCs exhibited increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL (interleukin)-1β (98%, P<0.0001) and IL-6 (460%, P<0.02) compared with nonfailing hMSCs. IL-1β or IL-6 in the absence of hMSCs prolonged action potential duration but only IL-6 increased Ca2+ alternans and promoted spontaneous calcium release activity in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, replicating the effects of failing hMSCs. In contrast, nonfailing hMSCs prevented Ca2+ alternans in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells during oxidative stress. Finally, nonfailing hMSCs exhibited >25× higher secretion of IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-1 compared with failing hMSCs. Importantly, IGF-1 supplementation or anti–IL-6 treatment rescued the arrhythmia substrates induced by failing hMSCs. Conclusions: We identified device leads as a novel source of cardiac hMSCs. Our findings show that cardiac hMSCs can regulate arrhythmia substrates by remodeling their secretome in disease. Importantly, therapy inhibiting (anti–IL-6) or mimicking (IGF-1) the cardiac hMSC secretome can rescue arrhythmia substrates.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/312a4f99f3c10001f56289b44c0b7e94807b0d00

However, the predictive value of a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) for myocardial injury and long-term mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection is not well known. Purpose To evaluate the association of prolonged QTc with myocardial injury and with 1-year mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods A total of 335 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection were prospectively studied. All patients underwent a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation within 48 h from admission. Using the Bazett formula, the QTc interval was calculated from the first ECG tracing recorded at the ER. QTc ≥ 440 ms in males and ≥450 ms in females was considered prolonged. Patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers and/or echocardiographic signs of myocardial dysfunction were considered to have myocardial injury. The predictive value of QTc prolongation for myocardial injury was calculated using a multivariate binary regression model. One-year mortality rate of patients with and without QTc prolongation was compared using the log-rank test, and a multivariate Cox regression model adjusting for multiple covariates was performed to evaluate the 1-year mortality risk. Results One-hundred and nine (32.5%) patients had a prolonged QTc. Compared to patients without QTc prolongation, patients with prolonged QTc were older (70 ± 14.4 vs. 62.7 ± 16.6, p < 0.001), had more comorbidities, and presented with a more severe disease. Prolonged QTc was an independent predictor for severe or critical disease (adjusted HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.3–3.5; p = 0.002) and myocardial injury (adjusted HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22–3.5; p = 0.007). One-year mortality of patients with prolonged QTc was higher than those with no QTc prolongation (40.4% vs. 15.5; p < 0.001). Following adjustment to multiple covariates including myocardial injury and disease severity, QTc prolongation was found to be associated with increased 1-year mortality risk (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.06–2.68, p = 0.027). Conclusion Prolonged QTc is associated with disease severity, myocardial injury and 1-year mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/771791a2fce3ed3056ce29cdcbd518a43e6e8e08

Who statement billion rise.;DemoPaper;Exosomes transport biologically active cargo (e.g., proteins and microRNA) between cells, including many of the paracrine factors that mediate the beneficial effects associated with stem-cell therapy. Stem cell derived exosomes, in particular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been shown previously to largely replicate the therapeutic activity associated with the cells themselves, which suggests that exosomes may be a useful cell-free alternative for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. However, the mechanisms that govern how exosomes home to damaged cells and tissues or the uptake and distribution of exosomal cargo are poorly characterized, because techniques for distinguishing between exosomal proteins and proteins in the targeted tissues are lacking. Here, we report the development of an in vivo model that enabled the visualization, tracking, and quantification of proteins from systemically administered MSC exosomes. The model uses bioorthogonal chemistry and cell-selective metabolic labeling to incorporate the non-canonical amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL) into the MSC proteome. ANL incorporation is facilitated via expression of a mutant (L274G) methionyl-tRNA-synthetase (MetRS∗) and subsequent incubation with ANL-supplemented media; after which ANL can be covalently linked to alkyne-conjugated reagents (e.g., dyes and resins) via click chemistry. Our results demonstrate that when the exosomes produced by ANL-treated, MetRS∗-expressing MSCs were systemically administered to mice, the ANL-labeled exosomal proteins could be accurately and reliably identified, isolated, and quantified from a variety of mouse organs, and that myocardial infarction (MI) both increased the abundance of exosomal proteins and redistributed a number of them from the membrane fraction of intact hearts to the cytosol of cells in infarcted hearts. Additionally, we found that Desmoglein-1c is enriched in MSC exosomes and taken up by ischemic myocardium. Collectively, our results indicate that this newly developed bioorthogonal system can provide crucial insights into exosome homing, as well as the uptake and biodistribution of exosomal proteins.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/483145420d03552bc487c7a4096ac2f751e1de33

Whether these are observed at a population scale, modulated by individuals’ genetics, and confer higher risks of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) are not known. Methods and Results Firstly, using the UK Biobank, the association between adiposity and QTc interval was assessed in participants with a resting 12-lead ECG (n = 23,683), and a polygenic risk score (PRS) was developed to investigate any modulatory effect of genetics. Participants were also categorised into four phenotypes according to the presence (+) or absence (–) of Ob, and if they were metabolically unhealthy (MU+) or not (MU-). QTc was positively associated with body mass index (BMI), body fat (BF), waist:hip ratio (WHR), and hip and waist girths. Individuals’ genetics had no significant modulatory effect on QTc-prolonging effects of increasing adiposity. QTc interval was comparably longer in those with metabolic perturbation without obesity (Ob-MU+) and obesity alone (Ob+MU-) compared with individuals with neither (Ob-MU-), and their co-existence (Ob+MU+) had an additive effect on QTc interval. Secondly, for 502,536 participants in the UK Biobank, odds ratios (ORs) for VA were computed for the four clinical phenotypes above using their past medical records. Referenced to Ob-MU-, ORs for VA in Ob-MU+ men and women were 5.96 (95% CI: 4.70–7.55) and 5.10 (95% CI: 3.34–7.80), respectively. ORs for Ob+MU+ were 6.99 (95% CI: 5.72–8.54) and 3.56 (95% CI: 2.66–4.77) in men and women, respectively. Conclusion Adiposity and metabolic perturbation increase QTc to a similar degree, and their co-existence exerts an additive effect. These effects are not modulated by individuals’ genetics. Metabolic ill-health is associated with a higher OR for VA than obesity.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f1db4dc8ae81fc67fb7d77f4f09f15c85be03b5

In China, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) have been widely utilized as promising and effective therapy options for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a particular kind of medical science reliant on real-world clinical practices and evidence. Therefore, using the real-world data extracted from pragmatic randomized controlled trials (PRCTs) have more reference value for the application of CPMs in NAFLD. Method Six databases were searched from their inception up to March 18, 2022. The methodological quality of the included study was evaluated by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Then, The STATA 13.0 program was then used to do a network meta-analysis (NMA) of real-world studies. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability values were applied to rank the examined treatments. Results Forty-three PRCTs (4997 cases in total) were identified. Da-Huang-Li-Dan capsule (DHLD), Dan-Ning tablet (DN), Dang-Fei-Li-Gan-Ning capsule (DFLGN), Qiang-Gan capsule (QG), and Hua-Zhi-Rou-Gan granule (HZRG) were among the five CPMs tested. As far as the clinical effective rate of the primary outcome index was concerned, the top three CPMs were DN + CDs: OR = 0.19, 95% CIs: 0.12, 0.31 (SUCRA: 81.8%); DFLGN + CDs: OR = 0.21, 95% CIs: 0.09, 0.46 (SUCRA: 74.9%), and DHLD + CDs: OR = 0.26, 95% CIs: 0.10, 0.67 (SUCRA: 61.1%). In terms of liver function index, DN + CDs ranked first in ALT index: MD = 15.81, 95% CIs: 10.05, 21.57 (SUCRA: 85.5%), DFLGN + CDs ranked first in AST index: MD = 14.94, 95% CIs: 4.77, 25.11 (SUCRA: 83.6%), HZRG + CDs ranked first in TC index: MD = 0.53, 95% CIs: 0.28, 1.03 (SUCRA: 87.1%) and TG index: MD = 1.8, 95% CIs: 1.41, 2.30 (SUCRA: 79.9%). Conclusion Using CPMs as a coadjuvant treatment might be positive efficacious intervention from which patients with NAFLD will derive benefits. When it came to the clinical effective rate and other outcomes, DN + CDs demonstrated a significant improvement in individuals with NAFLD.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8bc4e30aead25afc28ec94b31cd7190b1a05fb2a

Pressure through boy coach not very appear.;FullPaper;Background A number of epidemiological studies have suggested an association between metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the pathogenesis leading to AF in the context of MAFLD remains unclear. We therefore aimed at assessing the impact of MAFLD and liver fibrosis status on left atrium (LA) structure and function. Methods Patients with a Fatty Liver Index (FLI) >60 and the presence of metabolic comorbidities were classified as MAFLD+. In MAFLD+ patients, liver fibrosis severity was defined using the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Fibrosis Score (NFS), as follows: MAFLD w/o fibrosis (NFS ≦ −1.455), MAFLD w/indeterminate fibrosis (−1.455 < NFS < 0.675), and MAFLD w/fibrosis (NFS ≧ 0.675). In the first cohort of patients undergoing AF ablation, the structural and functional impact on LA of MAFLD was assessed by LA strain analysis and endocardial voltage mapping. Histopathological assessment of atrial fibrosis was performed in the second cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Finally, the impact of MAFLD on AF recurrence following catheter ablation was assessed. Results In the AF ablation cohort (NoMAFLD n = 123; MAFLD w/o fibrosis n = 37; MAFLD indeterm. fibrosis n = 75; MAFLD w/severe fibrosis n = 10), MAFLD patients with high risk of F3–F4 liver fibrosis presented more LA low-voltage areas as compared to patients without MAFLD (16.5 [10.25; 28] vs 5.0 [1; 11] low-voltage areas p = 0.0115), impaired LA reservoir function assessed by peak left atrial longitudinal strain (19.7% ± 8% vs 8.9% ± 0.89% p = 0.0268), and increased LA volume (52.9 ± 11.7 vs 43.5 ± 18.0 ml/m2 p = 0.0168). Accordingly, among the MAFLD patients, those with a high risk of F3–F4 liver fibrosis presented a higher rate of AF recurrence during follow-up (p = 0.0179). In the cardiac surgery cohort (NoMAFLD n = 12; MAFLD w/o fibrosis n = 5; MAFLD w/fibrosis n = 3), an increase in histopathological atrial fibrosis was observed in MAFLD patients with a high risk of F3–F4 liver fibrosis (p = 0.0206 vs NoMAFLD; p = 0.0595 vs MAFLD w/o fibrosis). Conclusion In conclusion, we found that liver fibrosis scoring in MAFLD patients is associated with adverse atrial remodeling and AF recurrences following catheter ablation. The impact of the management of MAFLD on LA remodeling and AF ablation outcomes should be assessed in dedicated studies.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e8609897530601f87efedb2b594060678329927

State sell anything power husband travel big.;FullPaper;Background and aims The epidemiological characteristics of MAFLD and its relationship with atrial fibrillation (AF) are limited in China. Therefore, we explored the epidemiological characteristics of MAFLD from adults along with the association of MAFLD and 12-ECG diagnosed AF in a nationwide population from health check-up centers. Methods This observational study used cross-sectional and longitudinal studies with 2,083,984 subjects from 2009 to 2017. Age-, sex-, and regional-standardized prevalence of MAFLD was estimated. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subclusters of MAFLD. Multivariable logistic regression and mixed-effects Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationship between MAFLD and AF. Results The prevalence of MAFLD increased from 22.75% to 35.58% during the study period, with higher rates in males and populations with high BMI or resided in northern regions. The MAFLD population was clustered into three classes with different metabolic features by LCA. Notably, a high proportion of MAFLD patients in all clusters had overweight and prediabetes or diabetes. The MAFLD was significantly associated with a higher risk of AF in the cross-sectional study and in the longitudinal study. In addition, the coexistence of prediabetes or diabetes had the largest impact on subsequent AF. Conclusion Our findings suggested a high prevalence of MAFLD and a high prevalence of other metabolic diseases in the MAFLD population, particularly overweight and glucose dysregulation. Moreover, MAFLD was associated with a significantly higher risk for existing and subsequent subclinical AF in the Chinese population.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dba79afbf9ce4393b0ac89c6ccf86774eb8f29b2

However, traditional treatment methods for MI have some limitations, such as irreversible myocardial necrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Fortunately, recent endeavors have shown that hydrogel materials can effectively prevent negative remodeling of the heart and improve the heart function and long-term prognosis of patients with MI due to their good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and electrical conductivity. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the research progress of injectable hydrogel in the treatment of MI in recent years and to introduce the rational design of injectable hydrogels in myocardial repair. Finally, the potential challenges and perspectives of injectable hydrogel in this field will be discussed, in order to provide theoretical guidance for the development of new and effective treatment strategies for MI.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9d35d0f05234c62a3d82e4c6176ee10a7ff55940

However, the perceptions of treatment outcomes evaluated by orthodontists and dentists are sparse, and laypeople’s perceptions have yet to be explored. Here, we explore the perceptions of orthodontists, dentists, and laypeople concerning the treatment outcomes achieved after completing the first sequence of aligners. This cross-sectional study involved 37 orthodontists, 67 dentists, and 93 laypeople. We administered an online questionnaire containing intra-oral photographs of nine completed cases with pre- and post-first sequences of aligners. As a control, we used a digital prediction system for the treatment outcome. Self-perception was reported using a visual analog scale. Both orthodontists and dentists had similar perceptions about treatment outcomes (p = 0.363) but significantly differed from laypeople (p ≤ 0.0001). Both orthodontists and dentists recommended further treatment; orthodontists were more critical than dentists (p ≤ 0.001). Orthodontists were more critical than dentists in their evaluations of the need for further treatments; however, their perceptions of treatment outcomes were similar. Laypeople were more satisfied with the treatment outcomes, were less concerned with occlusion, and were more focused on the aesthetic results of the treatment.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69c5221d4872276b40452852cd0bb78235a0ae63

Acrylic imprints of the lower incisor region were constructed for each appliance at T0 (unused appliance). Two appliances were then used intra-orally for each of the following defined periods of time: 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, or 15 days. Used aligners were adapted on its T0 imprint and both were sectioned buccolingually from the distal surfaces of each incisor at the attachment area. Eight surfaces were collected for each set of time (n = 32 surfaces). Microphotographs of obtained sections and micrometric measurements of aligner fit were recorded at five different levels using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mean values of the fit changes (gap width) and group comparisons were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests. Significance level was set at P < .05., , , RESULTS, Highly significant differences in aligner fit were found at the different time points assessed (P < .001) with the least mean gap width at 15 days (176 ± 98 μm) and the highest at 7 days (269 ± 145 μm). Significant differences in aligner fit at different attachment levels were also found (P < .01) with the least mean gap width at the middle of the labial surface of the attachment (187 ± 118 μm)., , , CONCLUSIONS, The 15-day period of intraoral aligner wear might still be recommended as it showed the best adaptation and least gap width between the aligner and the attachment.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f500a85a178a5f9ac3274c75eb86db71591290d0

Methods Six sets of clear aligners were designed for differential en-masse retraction and/or intrusion procedures in a first premolar extraction model. Group A0 was a control group with no activation. Groups A1–5 underwent different degrees of retractions and/or intrusions. Each group consisted of 10 aligners. Aligner forces were measured on a multi-axis force/torque transducer measurement system in real-time. Results In the en-masse retraction groups (A1 and A2), lingual and extrusive forces were observed on the incisors; the canines mainly received distal forces; intrusive forces were seen on the second premolars; and the molars received mesial forces. In the en-masse retraction and intrusion groups (A3, A4, and A5), incisors also received lingual and extrusive forces; canines received distal and intrusive forces; mesial and extrusive forces were seen on the second premolars; and the second molars received distal and intrusive forces. The vertical forces on the incisors did not differ significantly among groups A1, A3, and A5. However, the vertical forces on the second premolars reversed from intrusion in group A1 to extrusion in groups A3 and A5. Conclusions With clear aligners, the “bowing effect” is seen during en-masse anterior teeth retraction and can be partially relieved by performing en-masse retraction accompanied by anterior teeth intrusion. Vertical control of incisors remained unsolved during en-masse retraction, even when intrusive activation was added to the anterior teeth.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62c8f851b00c6dcbec025a69c5d0454168541f39

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the nature and magnitude of the association between NAFLD and hypertension. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for observational studies published up to May 1, 2021. Cohort studies that reported data on the association between NAFLD and incident hypertension or between hypertension and incident NAFLD were included. We used random-effects models to conduct meta-analysis on the measures of association from individual studies. A total of 11 studies were eligible for inclusion, among which 4 studies including 25,260 participants reported the association between hypertension and new-onset NAFLD. The presence of hypertension was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident NAFLD (HR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.41–1.88; I2 = 37.6%). On the other hand, 9 studies with data on 46,487 participants analyzed the effects of NAFLD on incident hypertension. Pooled analysis showed that the presence of NAFLD was significantly associated with an increased incidence of hypertension (HR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.29–1.87; I2 = 80.5%). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies in this analysis (p < 0.01). Sensitivity analyses showed that the magnitude of the association was significantly different in subgroups stratified by a mean age of participants and geographical location, which explains part of the heterogeneity. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates the existence of a bidirectional relationship between NAFLD and hypertension independent of traditional cardiometabolic risk factors.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85586890ee558d1c05c2857a6673e18ead4f83f6

Light sense think international region third., Step open accept.;Fear go series fact somebody they increase evening. Must evidence sign international.;Poster;We here present a comparative study of the Montmaurin-LN Middle Pleistocene mandible (Haute-Garonne, France). This mandible, of which its right and left molar series are preserved in situ, was found in La Niche cave (Montmaurin’s karst system) in 1949, and was first attributed to the ‘Mindel-Riss’ interglacial (= MIS 9 to 11) based on its geological context. Later studies based on geological and faunal evidence have attributed the Montmaurin-LN mandible to MIS 7. Following a detailed morphological and metric comparative study of the mandible in the 1970s, it was interpreted in the light of a still limited fossil record and the prevailing paradigm back then. Waiting for geochronological studies in the forthcoming years, here we review the main morphological and metrical features of this mandible and its molars, which have been reassessed in the framework of a remarkably enlarged Pleistocene fossil record since the mandible was first described, and our current, more in-depth understanding of human evolution in Europe. Using a selection of mandibular features with potential taxonomic signal we have found that the Montmaurin-LN mandible shares only a few derived traits with Neandertals. Our analyses reveal that this mandible is more closely related to the ancient specimens from the African and Eurasian Early and Middle Pleistocene, particularly due to the presence of primitive features of the Homo clade. In contrast, the external morphology of the molars is clearly similar to that of Neandertals. The results are assessed in the light of the present competing hypotheses used to explain the European hominin fossil record.;No;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42cd043d57a530a63146c8a0eca7bd31834c0140

Here, we focus on one aspect of facial shape and analyze shape variation of the dental arcades of these fossils together with other Homo individuals., , , MATERIALS AND METHODS, Three-dimensional landmark data were collected on computed tomographic scans and surface scans of Middle Pleistocene fossil hominins (n = 8), Homo erectus s.l. (n = 4), Homo antecessor (n = 1), Homo neanderthalensis (n = 13), recent (n = 52) and fossil (n = 19) Homo sapiens. To increase sample size, we used multiple multivariate regression to reconstruct complementary arches for isolated mandibles, and explored size and shape differences among maxillary arcades., , , RESULTS, The shape of the dental arcade in H. erectus s.l. and H. antecessor differs markedly from both Neanderthals and H. sapiens. The latter two show subtle but consistent differences in arcade length and width. Shape variation among Middle Pleistocene fossil hominins does not exceed the amount of variation of other species, but includes individuals with more primitive and more derived morphology, all more similar to Neanderthals and H. sapiens than to H. erectus s.l., , , DISCUSSION, Although our results cannot reject the hypothesis that the Middle Pleistocene fossil hominins belong to a single species, their shape variation comprises a more primitive morph that represents a likely candidate for the shape of the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and H. sapiens, and a more derived morph resembling Neanderthals. The arcade shape difference between Neanderthals and H. sapiens might be related to different ways to withstand mechanical stress.;Yes;No;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35e5c1a368a1ab8c69a93d119c019a2b1b627785

Garden late owner any west.;Poster;The Apidima 2 fossil cranium from South Peloponnese is one of the most important hominin specimens from Southeast Europe. Nevertheless, there has been continuous controversy as to whether it represents a so‐called Preneandertal/Homo heidelbergensis such as, for example, the Petralona cranium from Northern Greece or a more derived Neandertal. Recent absolute dating evidence alone cannot clarify the issue because both classifications would be possible during the respective Middle Pleistocene time span. Since only limited data were available on the cranium, there have been repeated claims for the need of a broader comparative study of the hominin. The present article presents a CT‐based virtual reconstruction including corrections of postmortem fractures and deformation as well as detailed metrical and morphological analyses of the specimen. Endocranial capacity could be estimated for the first time based on virtual reconstruction. Our multivariate analyses of metric data from the face and vault revealed close affinities to early and later Neandertals, especially showing the derived facial morphometrics. In addition, comparative analyses of Apidima 2 were done for many derived Neandertal features. Here again, a significant number of Neandertal features could be found in the Apidima cranium but no conditions common in Preneandertals. In agreement with a later Middle Pleistocene age Apidima is currently the earliest evidence of a hominin in Europe with such a derived Neandertal facial morphology. The place of Apidima in the complex process of Neandertal evolution as well as its taxonomic classification are discussed as well.

In this context, the Somme Valley in northern France offers a route to Britain during various Pleistocene low sea levels, and has provided numerous evidence of Lower Palaeolithic human occupation through fieldwork initiated during the 19th century. These localities are associated with the original definition in the 1930s by the French prehistorian Abbé Henri Breuil of the ‘Abbevillien’ (Abbevillian facies), based on lithic pieces including crudely made bifaces recovered in particular in some famous key localities of Abbeville, Carpentier, Léon and Moulin Quignon quarries. The history of the term and its definition subsequently gave rise to debates concerning the chronocultural framework of Palaeolithic assemblages among the scientific community of prehistorians over time, from Jacques Boucher de Perthes, Gabriel de Mortillet, Geoffroy d'Ault du Mesnil, Victor Commont, Henri Breuil and François Bordes. New investigations at these three localities, all associated with the High Terrace of the Somme system, pushed back the age of the expansion of the Acheulean both in northern France and in Western Europe to c. 670–650 000 years. They imply that early hominins were able to settle in North‐West Europe during both climatic temperate and cold phases. Our work, including new excavations and associated field observations of the three Abbeville localities involved at the onset of the controversy, allows a re‐examination of the Abbevillian and contributes to the discussion of the history of Prehistoric Science and the Earliest ‘Acheuleans’ in North‐West Europe.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0f37a0e05816449f26a7a7107a62de1a22b6056

Clark Howell of human skeletal remains from the Middle Pleistocene has always been one of the greatest gaps in human-paleontological knowledge. At THE SPARSE REPRESENTATION first, Southeastern Asia was unique in having provided remains from the Trinil beds in Java, but the signifi­ cance of this poorly preserved skull-cap was confirmed and greatly amplified by subsequent discoveries (Von Koenigswald 1940) of better preserved specimens at other localities of similar age, as well as in the still older Djetis beds. Still tfuly unique in all the world is the somewhat younger occupation site of Locality 1 Choukoutien, with its extraordinarily abundant, prob­ ably cannibalized, human remains in association with hearths, stone implements (Choukoutienian chopper/ chopping-tool complex), and remains of slaughtered animals. For many years, the only such find from the West was the enigmatic human mandible from the Grafenrain gravel pit at Mauer in the Rhineland. Then, within a few years in the mid-thirties, three additional speci­ mens came to light in western Europe (Steinheim), Britain (Swanscombe), and northwest Africa (Rabat, Morocco). In the last several years, further Middle Pleistocene human remains were found in northwest Africa, both in Algeria (Ternifine) and in Morocco (Sidi Abderrahman). All these discoveries (Fig. I) have excellent paleontological associations, and, in three cases (Swanscombe, Ternifine, Sidi Abderrahman), there are associated stone implements (Acheulean of various stages). However, no occupation site is yet F. CLARK HOWELL is Associate Professor of Anthropology, De­ partment of Anthropology, University of Chicago (Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.). He was born in 1925, and educated at the University of Chicago (Ph.D., 1953). HOWELL has undertaken field and other studies on early man in Europe (1953,1956) and in Africa (1954,1957-58,1959), and made a recent brief visit to Israel (1959). He has published various papers on human paleontology, especially as regards the Neanderthal problem, and on early man and the Pleisto­ cene in general. Prior to submitting the present paper to CURRENT ANTHRO­ POLOGY, HOWELL sent it, for comment and criticism, to three colleagues, of whom W. W. Howells and Kenneth P. Oakley responded. The response was primarily commendatory, and except for HOWELL's addition of some paragraphs along lines recommended by Oakley, the paper stands as first written. Vol. I . No.3' Ma)' 1960 known from the Middle Pleistocene of Europe or Africa with in situ human skeletal remains, stone im· plements, and the bones of slaughtered animals. These human skeletal remains, taken in conjunction with those from the Middle Pleistocene of eastern and southern Asia, have an important bearing on interpre­ tations of the course of human evolution. The signifi­ cance of these discoveries has been obscured by the pre­ occupation of some human paleontologists with other human remains either suspected to be of Pleistocene antiquity or questionable due to an extraordinary com· plex of morphological features (the famous hoax of Piltdown). Largely as a consequence of this, there have grown up two main interpretations of man's phylogeny in the Pleistocene, one depending on the possible im­ portance of the suspicious fossils, and the other de­ pending only on the scanty, but well-dated, human fos­ sils enumerated above. The former interpretation recognizes an early, at least earlier, Middle Pleistocene separation of a morphologically modern (sapiens) lineage. The latter postulates progressive transforma· tion of primitive and variable Middle Pleistocene hu­ man populations into diverse Neanderthal and re­ lated, geographically distinctive, groups, as well as into incipiently sapiens peoples. The purpose of this paper is to discuss tI-1e significance of the :Middle Pleistocene human remains from Europe and North Africa for the resolution of this basic problem in the study of human phylogeny.

When it did occur, however, ancient humans were not seen as presenting a pattern of diversity similar to that seen in the fossil records of nonhuman organisms. Instead, human evolution then, as now, has typically been interpreted as being unilinear. This belief can be traced to Huxley (1863), who argued that the Feldhofer Grotto Neanderthal skullcap was merely an extension into the past of morphology seen in the Australian Aborigine, whom he took to represent the primitive end of an extreme range of variation he thought characterized Homo sapiens. During the mid-20th century, Mayr and Dobzhansky (mis)used their clout as founders of the evolutionary synthesis to cement in paleoanthropology the idea that human evolutionary history was characterized by nonspeciation. As such, anything that could be interpreted as potentially representing taxic diversity was relegated to the status of individual variation. Lack of understanding of the history of human paleontology, and the biases that constrained its perspective on human evolution, continue to affect the ways in which most paleoanthropologists pigeonhole human fossils.;No;Yes;2006;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2c30af6b162b5a1994a0bf67afa99125b5d42ae

For some workers, it was the last common ancestor for the subsequent species Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis; others regard it as only a European form, giving rise to the Neanderthals. Following the impact of recent genomic studies indicating hybridization between modern humans and both Neanderthals and “Denisovans”, the status of these as separate taxa is now under discussion. Accordingly, clarifying the status of Homo heidelbergensis is fundamental to the debate about modern human origins. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c3eda6a43521090ce933dddb2399ffe01f84739

Job skin effort fact politics thus.;ShortPaper;Evolutionary and functional significance of the human chin has long been explored from various perspectives including masticatory biomechanics, speech, and anterior tooth size. Recent ontogenetic studies have indicated that the spatial position of internally forming anterior teeth partially constrains adult mandibular symphyseal morphology. The present study therefore preliminarily examined the size and placement of developing anterior teeth in immature Neanderthal mandibles of Dederiyeh 1 and 2, compared with similarly-aged modern humans (N = 16) and chimpanzees (N = 7) whose incisors are comparatively small and large among extant hominids, respectively. The Dederiyeh 1 mandible is described as slightly presenting a mental trigone and attendant mental fossa, whereas Dederiyeh 2 completely lacks such chin-associated configurations. Results showed that, despite symphyseal size being within the modern human range, both Dederiyeh mandibles accommodated overall larger anterior dentition and displayed a remarkably wide bicanine space compared to those of modern humans. Dederiyeh 2 had comparatively thicker deciduous incisor roots and more enlarged permanent incisor crypts than Dederiyeh 1, but both Dederiyeh individuals exhibited a total dental size mostly intermediate between modern humans and chimpanzees. These findings potentially imply that the large deciduous/permanent incisors collectively distended the labial alveolar bone, obscuring an incipient mental trigone. It is therefore hypothesized that the appearance of chin-associated features, particularly of the mental trigone and fossa, can be accounted for partly by developmental relationships between the sizes of the available mandibular space and anterior teeth. This hypothesis must be, however, further addressed with more referential samples in future studies.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6da9fa4756f0cab7ffb70f1307df496f821af2f9

Materials and Methods: In order to predictably manage the correction of deep bite with aligners, precision bite ramps on maxillary incisors have been used while posterior extrusion and anterior intrusion in the lower jaw with lateral attachments and proper levelling of the curve of Spee have been planned. Transverse correction and controlled upper and lower incisors proclination completed the treatment plan. Results: Full deep bite correction with normal overbite was obtained in nine months of treatment by a combination of anterior intrusion and posterior torque correction, distal tipping and relative extrusion.

Orthodontic correction of dental transpositions is more complicated.15,17-26 Since the alveolar ridge is usually not wide enough to accommodate two dental roots moving past each other, root parallelism will likely be less than ideal, and gingival recession may occur as the roots move outside the alveolar housing (Fig. 1). Alignment of the teeth in their transposed locations is more predictable, although some patients Canine transposition is generally associated with other anomalies, such as agenesis (40%), deciduous canine retention (50%), and peg-shaped maxillary lateral incisors (25%).9 The etiology of transposition may involve various environmental and genetic causes, including lack of canine root resorption, mechanical interference with erupting permanent teeth, migration of a tooth from its normal path of eruption,9-15 early loss or prolonged retention of deciduous teeth,13,14 a genetic interchange in the position of developing tooth buds during odontogenesis, or hereditary factors.7,8,16 Canine and lateral incisor transposition usually results from dentofacial trauma in the deciduous dentition and subsequent drifting of permanent teeth,4,10,16 although a genetic basis cannot be totally excluded.10-12 ALDO GIANCOTTI, DDS, MS ANDREA CONIGLIARO, MD, DDS GIANLUCA MAMPIERI, DDS, MS Aligner Treatment of Transposed Maxillary Canines and Lateral Incisors;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93757029636086f6a7dc777f3f5f3bdaa7cfca81

With the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight, may be it is time to put newer tools, such as clear aligner therapy, for better use. Fixed orthodontic appliances by nature are not always self-limiting, which, if left unmonitored over a long period may cause undesirable side effects, pain, and discomfort. The undesired tooth movements that may occur with arch wire-guided mechanics in addition to problems with cut wires or removed brackets may be minimized with the use of aligners. While the benefits of using aligners are for all to see, they do require extensive planning and careful evaluation of the progress. This article reviews the advantages of using aligners during the pandemic period and how it can be beneficial in helping orthodontists resume their practice.;Yes;No;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20bf1654b40c5438de23ed34dfe5c6a555f64558

Erkodur, Essix C+®, Eucommia elastomer, and edgewise brackets were used (n = 3, each; thickness = 1.0 mm, each). The orthodontic force on the upper right incisor was measured every 24 h for two weeks using a custom-made measuring device. The force of the Eucommia elastomer (4.25 ± 0.274 N) and multi bracket system (5.32 ± 0.338 N) did not change from the beginning to the end (p > 0.01). The orthodontic force exerted by the Eucommia elastomer was lower than that of the multi-bracket orthodontic appliance from the beginning to the end. The force of Erkodur significantly decreased from the beginning to 24 h (6.47 ± 1.40 N) and 48 h (3.30 ± 0.536 N) (p < 0.01). The force of Essix C+® significantly decreased from the beginning (13.2 ± 0.845 N) to 24 h (8.77 ± 0.231 N) (p < 0.01). The thermoplastic orthodontic appliance made of Eucommia elastomer continuously exerted a constant orthodontic force for two weeks under water immersion conditions. The orthodontic force of Eucommia elastomer was found to be similar to the orthodontic force exerted by the multi-bracket orthodontic appliance with 0.019 × 0.025 in nickel–titanium wire. These results suggest that the Eucommia elastomer has possibly become one of the more useful materials to form thermoplastic orthodontic appliance exerting low continues orthodontic force.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/247884cd9f758c3b42f9f5e257667f48c69a1dfe

Computer center dark.;ShortPaper;Accelerating orthodontic tooth movement has become a topical issue and the corticotomy seems to be the only effective and safe technique reported in the literature. Simultaneously, aesthetic orthodontic treatment with removable clear aligners has become commonly requested. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the management of facilitated aesthetic orthodontic treatment, a combined approach including piezocision corticotomy and clear aligners for orthodontic treatment. Orthodontic planning for traditional clear aligners should be modified to take advantage of the corticotomy technique in order to facilitate the most difficult orthodontic movements needed to achieve treatment completion, where each aligner will be used for four days rather than 15 days for a total time of four months. A corticotomy with a modified minimally invasive flapless piezocision technique should be performed in both jaws at the same time, before the time window of the orthodontic treatment, where the most difficult orthodontic movements are planned. Treatment planning where difficult orthodontic movements, such as anterior open-bite closure and extraction space closure, are easily managed with clear aligners and are presented as examples of facilitated aesthetic orthodontic treatment application. The combination between aesthetic treatment with clear aligners and modified piezocision corticotomy, if carefully planned, seems to represent a synergy that achieves the current goals of orthodontic treatment. The primary objectives of this combination should be facilitating difficult orthodontic movements and reducing treatment duration.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fc8dd7bff3847b34dd2260754ded68fbc42df01

Common toward open industry., Artist alone cold. Officer beyond throughout.;ShortPaper;In order to reassess previous hypotheses concerning dental size reduction of the posterior teeth during Pleistocene human evolution, current fossil dental evidence is examined. This evidence includes the large sample of hominid teeth found in recent excavations (1984-1993) in the Sima de los Huesos Middle Pleistocene cave site of the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain). The lower fourth premolars and molars of the Atapuerca hominids, probably older than 300 Kyr, have dimensions similar to those of modern humans. Further, these hominids share the derived state of other features of the posterior teeth with modern humans, such as a similar relative molar size and frequent absence of the hypoconulid, thus suggesting a possible case of parallelism. We believe that dietary changes allowed size reduction of the posterior teeth during the Middle Pleistocene, and the present evidence suggests that the selective pressures that operated on the size variability of these teeth were less restrictive than what is assumed by previous models of dental reduction. Thus, the causal relationship between tooth size decrease and changes in food-preparation techniques during the Pleistocene should be reconsidered. Moreover, the present evidence indicates that the differential reduction of the molars cannot be explained in terms of restriction of available growth space. The molar crown area measurements of a modern human sample were also investigated. The results of this study, as well as previous similar analyses, suggest that a decrease of the rate of cell proliferation, which affected the later-forming crown regions to a greater extent, may be the biological process responsible for the general and differential dental size reduction that occurred during human evolution.;Yes;No;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/203d8528797a0244dec8c83eab1033fdf502170a

Analysis of the modern sample shows that most interspecific variation in vault thickness can be accounted for by variation in body size. Correlation values are moderate to high (r = 0.75-0.98), and all variables exhibit positive allometry. The bone thickness: body mass relationship of modern humans broadly conforms with that of other primates. However, in the distribution of relative thickness throughout the skull, H. sapiens is distinguished by relative thickening of the parietal and extreme relative thinning of the temporal squama. The bone thickness: body mass relationship in the two early hominid species is examined using published mean body weight estimates generated from post-cranial predictor variables. A. africanus exhibits great similarity to modern humans in its relation to the catarrhine regression data and in the distribution of relative thickness throughout the skull. H. erectus also shows a modern human-like pattern in the distribution of its relative thickness; however, its bone thickness: body mass relationship is dissimilar to that displayed by all other taxa, including the other hominid species. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the published body weight estimate assigned to H. erectus greatly underestimates actual mean body size for Asian members of this species.;Yes;No;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c5e7c10dd1157bb27ece1d3604598bf2515e9a3

The Dmanisi mandible is perhaps one of the most interesting findings, as it supposedly represents one of the oldest hominids outside of Africa. Recently, different interpretations have been published about this specimen. Our comparison of the Dmanisi mandible with a large sample of mandibles and teeth has led us to a new interpretation. In our view, the Dmanisi mandible exhibits a unique combination of traits. Some of its features, taken in isolation, may be attributed to morphological extremes within the genus Homo. The architecture of the mandible as well as the morphology and dimensions of incisors, canines, and P3s are clearly primitive. However, dental traits such as the reduction of the talonid in the P4s and a distally decreasing molar series seems to be derived. Some combinations of these traits are found in specimens of Homo ergaster and differ from those generally present in later hominids. Thus, we propose that the Dmanisi mandible might be taxonomically classified as Homo sp. indet. (aff. ergaster). Furthermore, some aspects of the dentition in Dmanisi display close similarities to Asian Homo erectus. If the 1.8-1.6 Myr dating for the Dmanisi mandible is correct, the differentiation of the Asian branch of the genus Homo could be regarded as a very ancient event.;Yes;Yes;1998;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67b783cbee06496bd19314f9edc88b6e0d083b26

The TD6 dental sample consists of two deciduous and 28 permanent teeth, belonging to a minimum of six individuals. Paleomagnetic analyses of the TD sequence suggest an age for the Aurora stratum of greater than 780 ka. The associated fossil macro- and micrommals are consistent with a date for the Atapuerca-TD6 hominids at the end of the Early Pleistocene. As a whole, the size of the TD6 teeth is large and comparable to that of the African Lower Pleistocene hominids. Most morphological dental traits are plesiomorphic for the genus Homo, whereas the shape analysis has revealed some size-related trends that differ from those seen in early Homo. Thus, the relative size increase of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth and buccolingual diameter of the first molars, the reduction of the third molars and lower canines, and the P(3)>P(4)size sequence are all characteristic of the population represented by the TD6 hominids. The morphological evidence suggests that the TD6 hominids are closer to African Lower and early Middle Pleistocene hominids than they are to European Middle Pleistocene hominids. However, some dental traits of the TD6 hominids, such as the expansion of the anterior teeth, the P(3)>P(4)size sequence, and the morphology of the lower canine also suggest an evolutionary continuity between the population represented by these hominids and the European Middle Pleistocene population. Furthermore, dental evidence indicates that the TD6 hominids are clearly distinct from Asian H. erectus. Dental evidence also suggests that the TD6 hominids could represent an evolutionary connection between H. ergaster and H. heidelbergensis.;No;Yes;1999;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f78cb16f9993a9ea88696eb071b6a8e38067895a

The analysis shows that ATD6-5 displays a generalized morphology largely shared with both African and European Lower and Middle Pleistocene samples. However, distinctive African traits, such as corpus robustness and strong alveolar prominence, are absent in the Gran Dolina specimen. At the same time, none of the apomorphic features that characterize Middle and early Upper Pleistocene European hominids can be recognized in ATD6-5. Finally, the Gran Dolina specimen displays a remarkable position of the mylohyoid groove, only comparable to that found in immature specimens of Homo ergaster, and very rarely in adult H. sapiens. The morphology of ATD6-5 supports the hypothesis of an African origin for the first Europeans with subsequent phylogenetic continuity with Middle Pleistocene populations in Europe.

Safe capital information sense class music series., Story program group then early.;ShortPaper;Proponents of the model known as the "human revolution" claim that modern human behaviors arose suddenly, and nearly simultaneously, throughout the Old World ca. 40-50 ka. This fundamental behavioral shift is purported to signal a cognitive advance, a possible reorganization of the brain, and the origin of language. Because the earliest modern human fossils, Homo sapiens sensu stricto, are found in Africa and the adjacent region of the Levant at >100 ka, the "human revolution" model creates a time lag between the appearance of anatomical modernity and perceived behavioral modernity, and creates the impression that the earliest modern Africans were behaviorally primitive. This view of events stems from a profound Eurocentric bias and a failure to appreciate the depth and breadth of the African archaeological record. In fact, many of the components of the "human revolution" claimed to appear at 40-50 ka are found in the African Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the "human revolution" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World. The African Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominid fossil record is fairly continuous and in it can be recognized a number of probably distinct species that provide plausible ancestors for H. sapiens. The appearance of Middle Stone Age technology and the first signs of modern behavior coincide with the appearance of fossils that have been attributed to H. helmei, suggesting the behavior of H. helmei is distinct from that of earlier hominid species and quite similar to that of modern people. If on anatomical and behavioral grounds H. helmei is sunk into H. sapiens, the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250-300 ka.;Yes;Yes;2000;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06021515512fc56b41e0b766c92598ee722068de

Pattern single figure deep beyond. Might impact mother write maintain., Community appear affect expect. When well visit dream realize.;Poster;Analysis of variation and distribution of evolutionary novelties is meaningful in understanding evolutionary processes. The mandible, as a morphological complex, comprises a large number of derived Neanderthal features. The present study investigates whether the features usually considered as European lineage apomorphies evolved independently; the occurrence of these features is studied in the mandibles from the Sima de los Huesos (SH) site (Atapuerca, Spain). For comparative purposes, a large sample of Neanderthal mandibles as well as older fossil Homo specimens have been used for the study. Chi-square tests were employed to test for independence. The SH mandibles present a set of features that clearly show the basic architecture of the Neanderthal mandible. A highly significant association is detected in the variation of the position of the mental foramen, the lateral prominence, and the anterior marginal tubercle, as well as in the development of retromolar space. However, a much weaker association is detected in the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, with a few exceptions. Features of the external aspect of the mandible occur chronologically earlier than those observed in the internal aspect. The hypothesis that two distinct and consecutive morphological processes have driven the emergence of the European lineage throughout the Middle Pleistocene is proposed. A first transformation affects the mandible by means of backwards displacement of the structures located at the external aspect, as well as the position of the condyle. A second process would modify the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, in which the relief of the masseteric and pterygoid fossae are affected, in association with a spatial rearrangement of the corpus and ramus. Analyzed individually, some of the considered features may be questioned as Neanderthal apomorphies (Trinkaus,1993; Franciscus and Trinkaus, 995); however, the joint occurrence of many of them suggests that the complex is an evolutionary novelty.;No;Yes;2001;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72fd2d645ce07ea923c015e9a743790fa11f07ea

These oil pattern follow.;Poster;A silicon piezoresistive stress sensor is developed to measure the three components of the orthodontic forces of a tooth in invisible aligners. The stress sensor chip consists of multiple piezoresistor rosettes, and is fixed on the tooth surface to measure the orthodontic force induced stresses. An inverse problem algorithm is established to reconstruct the orthodontic forces of the tooth from the measured stresses. A key thinning process is developed using chemical-mechanical polishing to thin the sensor chip from 650 to 100 , such that it can be accommodated to the limited space between the aligner and the tooth, without much influence on the orthodontic force. The ultra-thin thickness enables the sensor chip to be compliance with tooth deformation, and improves the stress measurement sensitivity as much as 40 times, making it capable of measuring small orthodontic force. The sensor design, fabrication, orthodontic stress measurement, and force reconstruction are given in details, and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using miniaturized and ultra-thin sensors to determine the in vitro orthodontic forces.;Yes;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/627d62970450ec2ae7e036e70d94437fee6df8a1

Certain interesting clear.;FullPaper;Systematic excavations, begun in 1987, at the Valdegoba cave site in northern Spain have yielded the remains of five individuals associated with a Middle Paleolithic stone tool technology and Pleistocene fauna. A fragmentary mandible of an adolescent (VB1), preserving nearly a full set of teeth, exhibits a symphyseal tubercle and slight incurvatio mandibulae anterior on the external symphysis. Both the superior and inferior transverse tori are present on the internal aspect. A second individual (VB2) is represented by a set of ten deciduous teeth consistent with an age at death of 6-9 months. A proximal manual phalanx (VB3) displays a relatively broad head, a characteristic which is found in both Neandertals, as well as European Middle Pleistocene hominids. VB4 is a fourth metatarsal that lacks the distal epiphysis, indicating it comes from an adolescent individual, and has a relatively high robusticity index. Finally, VB5 is a fifth metatarsal of an adult. The VB1 mandible shows a combination of archaic characteristics as well as more specific Neandertal morphological traits. The VB2 deciduous teeth are very small, and both the metrics and morphology seem more consistent with a modern human classification. The postcranial elements are undiagnostic, U-Th dating has provided an age of >350 ka for the base of the sequence and a date of <73.2+/-5 ka for level 7, near the top. Faunal analysis and radiometric dates from other nearby Mousterian sites suggests that the Valdegoba site is correlative with oxygen isotope stages 3-6 on the Iberian peninsula, and an Upper Pleistocene age for the Valdegoba hominids seems most reasonable.;Yes;Yes;2001;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7073181f006adbbf14f615a752b86a2aa56c4c56

Dog first environmental summer student away.;Poster;Our view of H. erectus is vastly different today than when Pithecanthropus erectus was described in 1894. Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records.;No;Yes;2003;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae8842481ae5297a9001a3d865e240f101647e80

Accurate diagnosis and treatment planning is essential to achieve the desired results. Adult orthodontic patients are increasingly motivated by esthetic considerations and reject the idea of conventional fixed appliances. In recent years, Invisalign appliances have gained tremendous attention for orthodontic treatment of adult patients to meet their esthetic demands. In this case report, a case of Class I malocclusion was treated with mandibular incisor extraction using the Invisalign appliance system. Successful tooth alignment of both arches was achieved.

Some studies have shown that mechanical vibration can affect the rate of tooth movement and other aspects of orthodontic treatment. The purpose of this systematic review was to substantiate the effects of vibration as an adjunct to clear aligner treatment. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Scopus and also hand searching of reference lists was conducted for finding published studies up to March 2021. Two authors reviewed the titles and abstracts independently to select relevant studies and the full texts where there was some skepticism. Seven papers were included in this study following removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, four of which were randomized controlled trial and three were retrospective studies. In the majority of studies, High-Frequency Vibration (HFV) has shown to be effective in accelerating tooth movement and reducing the exchange interval of aligners. Little data have advocated that HFV can increase bone density, reduce pain or root resorption. It seems that HFV is more effective than low frequency vibration in patients treated with clear aligners. Based on a low level of certainty, HFV can increase the rate of tooth movement and decrease the exchange interval of clear aligners. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the effects of vibration on pain and discomfort, bone density, and root resorption.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b58816cc3f6461bb0367359c355c8ac0873f4ab

Assume take difference.;ShortPaper;Background/objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the differences in tooth movements when implementing the same virtual setup on the following four different software packages: ClinCheck® Pro, Ortho Analyzer®, SureSmile®, and Ortho Insight 3D®. Materials/Methods: Twenty-five adult patients treated with Invisalign® at the Case School of Dental Medicine (CWRU)’s department of orthodontics were retrospectively collected. Initial stereolithography (STL) files were obtained and imported into three software packages. The teeth were moved in order to replicate the virtual setup from ClinCheck® Pro. The final outcomes were exported from each software package. ClinCheck® Pro STL files were used as the reference while STL files produced by the other software packages were used as the targets. Best fit superimpositions were performed using Geomagic® Control X. Based on the results, tooth position was adjusted in the three software packages until the virtual setups from ClinCheck® Pro were replicated. Once confirmed, the tables containing the tooth movements were compared. The number of aligners and number of attachments automatically generated from each of the software packages were also evaluated. Results: Extrusion/intrusion (p ≤ 0.0001) and translation buccal/lingual (p ≤ 0.0004) were significantly different among the software packages. ClinCheck® Pro and SureSmile® (p ≤ 0.000), SureSmile® and Ortho Insight 3D® (p ≤ 0.014), SureSmile® and Ortho Analyzer® (p ≤ 0.009), and Ortho Insight 3D® and Ortho Analyzer® (p ≤ 0.000) generated a significantly different number of maxillary aligners. The results varied slightly for mandibular aligners, with only ClinCheck® Pro and Ortho Insight 3D® (p ≤ 0.000), SureSmile® and Ortho Insight 3D® (p ≤ 0.000), and Ortho Insight 3D® and Ortho Analyzer® (p ≤ 0.000) exhibiting a significant difference. ClinCheck® Pro and SureSmile® (p ≤ 0.000) differed significantly in the number of attachments produced. Conclusions: There are statistically significant differences in extrusion/intrusion, translation buccal/lingual, the number of aligners, and the number of attachments when implementing the same virtual setup on different software packages.

Nearly mother race else.;FullPaper;ABSTRACT Introduction: Orthodontists have been using clear aligners to treat malocclusions, and one potential effect of treatment with orthodontic aligners is the intrusion and/or resists extrusion of the posterior teeth. This “bite-block effect” is primarily anecdotal due to the frequent occurrence of posterior open bites in patients after clear aligner therapy. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare changes promoted by clear aligners and traditional fixed appliances in cephalometric measurements of the vertical dimension and molar position in adult patients with Class I malocclusion treated with non-extraction. Methods: Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of adult patients treated with either clear aligners (n=44) or traditional fixed appliances (n=22) were selected for retrospective analysis. Eight interval measurements and one nominal measurement were evaluated: anterior overbite (OB), mandibular plane angle related to cranial base (SN_MP) and related to Frankfort (FMA), lower molar height (L6H) and upper molar height (U6H), palatal plane to mandibular plane angle (PP_MP), lower facial height (LFH), total facial height (TFH), and posterior open bite (Posterior_OB). A single evaluator traced all cephalographs, and changes in select measures of the vertical dimension were compared within and between groups. Results: OB decreased (1.15 mm) and L6H increased (0.63 mm) in the traditional fixed appliance group. Mandibular plane angles (related to cranial base and to Frankfort) increased (0.43° and 0.53°, respectively) in the clear aligner group, but just FMA showed significant difference between groups (difference of 0.53°). LFH and TFH increased (ranging from 0.52 mm to 0.80 mm) in both groups, with no differences between treatment modality. Presence of visible posterior open bite significantly increased over the course of treatment. OB, FMA and L6H exhibited an interaction between treatment stage (pre- and post-treatment) and modality (clear aligner therapy and traditional fixed appliances), but no interaction among these three variables was found. Conclusions: The evidence does not support the theory that clear aligner therapy produces better vertical dimension control than traditional fixed appliances. Traditional fixed appliance therapy slightly extruded the lower molar, and clear aligner therapy produced a slightly mandibular backward rotation.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f088e6a74ac9e32d172ce6bfa993bbbb73a1e555

Yard machine relationship mean.;DemoPaper;Clear and removable tooth aligners for orthodontics treatments have become an increasingly popular alternative to fixed appliances. Even if protocols suggest removing aligners before eating or drinking, most patients retain them when they drink beverages. Alterations in the material during the daily use could determine a reduction in the application forces, affecting the desired orthodontic movement; the knowledge of how this material reacts when subjected to different aging processes is mandatory to establish the predictability of the orthodontic treatment. According to this, the aim of the present study was to assess a new objective approach, coupling spectroscopic and chemometric tools, to evaluate the changes occurring in Invisalign® aligners, the most widely used brand, exposed in vitro to coffee, tea, Coca Cola® and UV radiation for 24 and 48 h. In particular, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was utilized to characterize, at the molecular level, the chemical and color modifications in the surfaces of the appliances; the obtained data were submitted to PCA and one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Moreover, a colorimetry analysis was carried out to evaluate any changes in color and transparency. Coffee and tea samples displayed the major color changes between the tested groups. The differences highlighted in the spectral features of coffee, tea and UV-treated samples were mainly ascribable to color and transparency changes, because the chemical properties remained unaltered.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a0ef9f55d976aa6d01201c4fb24e0e0ba288a0d

The largest reduction in tooth size was found to take place between the Riss and WAuUrm I–II groups, and to affect anterior teeth as well as posterior teeth. It is suggested that the differences between these conclusions and those reached by Brace ('67) are a function of the samples used. Similarly the observed reduction in tooth size was not associated with any concomitant reduction in functional demands made on the dentition, but appears to have outstripped them, as demonstrated by the increased severity of attrition found in the later smaller-toothed groups.;Yes;Yes;1977;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07784598f78b678d9bef3006b00a9f04db07ae36

The results showed little regional variation in tooth size for the Middle and Upper Pleistocene sites compared (except for Krapina) but considerable differences in the severity of attrition and dental pathology. These differences were considered indicative of regional differences in the functional load borne by the teeth, and in view of the similar technological status of the groups studied, were attributed to environmental differences in the diet.

A critical analysis of emergence criteria applicable to skeletal samples leads to an occlusal eruption schedule which can be used to determine wear rates. These are used to provide dental ages for the Krapina jaws and isolated teeth. A number of individual associations of isolated teeth with existing jaws and with each other result in an estimated individual count between 75 and 82. Demographic analysis indicates that the specimens do not accurately sample a living population; numerous adults as well as children under the age of three are not represented. Metric analysis indicates a moderate range of variation. The interproximal wear rates are low, and no evidence of tooth size associated differential survivorship can be demonstrated. The sample fits in a European evolutionary sequence of reducing posterior and expanding anterior permanent teeth, while the deciduous teeth seem to undergo expansion through the Würm glaciation.;Yes;Yes;1978;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3d83430eae27832751e54cc3b5825b3519d9586

Four individuals were recovered in situ in Beds II to IV, while three more are most probably derived from Bed IV, the Masek Beds and the Lower Ndutu Beds. One specimen is of uncertain provenance. Deposits from which the fossils were collected range from late Lower Pleistocene to Middle Pleistocene in age. Of particular interest are three fragmentary lower jaws, which can be compared to mandibles of Homo erectus known from localities in Northwest Africa and China. Olduvai hominid 22, a nearly complete half mandible with crowns of P3-M2 in place, shares many anatomical features with fossils from Ternifine and Choukoutien. This individual is also similar to a jaw from the Kapthurin Formation west of Lake Baringo, Kenya. How best to interpret these comparisons is not clear, but in view of marked similarities between specimens representing geographically diverse populations from different time periods, it may be unwise to rely on mandibular evidence alone to document the presence of regional lineages. Gradual change and continuity within a sequence of Northwest African Homo fossils has been endorsed by many workers, but such hypotheses cannot be tested adequately with the fragmentary jaws available.;Yes;Yes;1980;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f10b393a268ccee8eca3e03ac26754adbbdc8fc

The corpus, many of the tooth crowns, and most of the left ascending ramus are preserved. The teeth are heavily and asymmetrically worn. Compared with BK 67 (the 1966 mandible) the body of BK 8518 is more robust; the internal symphyseal buttressing is more pronounced; the M3s have seven cusps and exceed the M2s in size. There are no compelling reasons, however, to attribute the two mandibles to different taxa and, in view of the lack of any comprehensive taxonomic diagnosis for Homo erectus, "erectus-like," and habiline mandibular remains, the new specimen is also best regarded as Homo sp. indet.

South former current major participant out unit.;DemoPaper;The subocclusal morphology of 168 permanent mandibular premolars (N = 77) and molars (N = 91) of Plio-Pleistocene hominids has been investigated. The taxonomic allocation of the teeth, which represent at least 46 individuals, was based on nondental evidence. Specimens were allocated to one of two major taxonomic categories, (EAFROB or EAFHOM), East African Homo erectus (EAFHER), or their taxonomic affinity was regarded as 'unknown' (N = 17). Information about the root system was derived from radiography and direct observation. Morphometric data were in the form of nine linear and two angular measurements based on eighteen reference points. Root form was also assessed using a scheme which recognised four classes of root morphology. Data were compared using both univariate and multivariate techniques, including Principal Component and Canonical Variate analysis. Posterior probabilities derived from the latter were used (in a two-taxon design model) to assess the affinities of the 'unknown' specimens. The variation in hominid mandibular premolar root form was interpreted as two morphoclines, based on the presumed primitive condition of the P3 (with mesiobuccal and distal roots, 2R: MB and D) and P4 (with mesial and distal root, 2R: M and D) root systems. One trend apparently leads towards root reduction (i.e. P3 = 1 R; P4 = 1 R), and the other to root elaboration (i.e. P3 and P4 = 2R: M and D). The extreme form of the latter is the 'molarisation' of the premolar roots seen in EAFROB. Despite major differences in root form there was relatively little taxonomic variation in root metrics, except for a more robust distal root system in EAFROB. Molar root form showed little interspecific variation except for M2 in which the roots in EAFROB were larger and more robust, with differences in root height being greater for the distal than for the mesial roots. Root form and metrics enable four of the 'unknown' specimens (KMN-ER 819, 1482, 1483 and 1801) to be tentatively allocated to EAFHOM, and a single specimen, KMN-ER 3731, to EAFROB. Published assessments of the root morphology of the 'robust' australopithecines from Swartkrans suggest that the premolar root form of Australopithecus (Paranthropus) robustus is not obviously intermediate between the presumed ancestral condition, and the 'molarised' mandibular premolar root systems of Australopithecus (Paranthropus) boisei.;Yes;Yes;1988;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ee38ed3cfdd51933162ca28a5b8ddff4775ee960

Financial at cell board.;ShortPaper;The earliest traces of Homo erectus have been uncovered in eastern Africa, where fossils from the Turkana basin are 1.7 to 1.8 million years in age. Later members of this species reached other parts of the continent, and probably Homo erectus had begun to disperse out of Africa before 1.0 million years ago. One route would have taken archaic people around the eastern Mediterranean, to Europe and southwestern Asia. Assemblages of crude stone tools are found in Europe, although no human bones are known from these Early Pleistocene localities. The spread of Homo erectus eastward into Asia is poorly documented, but it is clear that populations were present in Java at an early date, and the famous caves at Zhoukoudian were inhabited nearly 0.5 million years ago. Throughout this long history, the species seems to have remained stable morphologically. There are few indications of change, and evolutionary continuity with later groups is not readily apparent. Anatomically more advanced fossils from sites in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa provide the most promising links between Homo erectus and other forms of Homo. Perhaps we should look to these regions, rather than to East Asia, for the origin of our own species.;No;Yes;1991;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d38e76a4c1418d06d76a1819fb0e6b143b6f329e

Assessments of occlusion were made using the American Board of Orthodontics Discrepancy Index (DI) for initial records and Cast-Radiograph Evaluation (CRE) for final records. Number of appointments, number of emergency visits, and overall treatment time were determined from chart reviews. Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation, Wilcoxon rank tests, unpaired t-tests, and Chi-square tests, with significance set to P ≤ .05., , , RESULTS, Pretreatment, the aligner and fixed groups showed no significant difference in overall severity (DI: 11.9 ± 5.3 vs 11.6 ± 4.8) or in any individual DI category. Posttreatment scores showed finishes for the aligner group had fewer discrepancies from ideal relative to the fixed appliance group (CRE: 30.1 ± 8.3 vs 37.0 ± 9.3; P < .01). Patients treated with aligners had fewer appointments (13.7 ± 4.4 vs 19.3 ± 3.6; P < .0001), fewer emergency visits (0.8 ± 1.0 vs 3.6 ± 2.5; P < .0001), and shorter overall treatment time (16.9 ± 5.7 vs 23.4 ± 4.4 months; P < .0001)., , , CONCLUSIONS, Outcomes for treatment of mild malocclusions in adolescents showed equivalent effectiveness of clear aligners compared to fixed appliances, with significantly improved results for clear aligner treatment in terms of tooth alignment, occlusal relations, and overjet.

A commercially available dental paste, named Cupral, based on copper–calcium–hydroxide, was used. A healthy volunteer (female, 32 years old), undergoing orthodontic treatment with thermoplastic clear aligners was enrolled. By conventional/confocal microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, 2-week used aligners were examined for microbial plaque, prior and following exposure to Cupral. Confocal microscopy revealed abundant plaque irregularly distributed onto the aligner surface. Following Cupral treatment, a drastic decrease occurred in plaque thickness and matrix presence. As assessed by the CFU assay, total microbial load approached 109 CFUs/aligner, with slight differences in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis culture conditions; six macroscopically different types of colonies were detected and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Following Cupral treatment, microbial load dropped to undetectable levels, irrespectively of the conditions considered. Exposure of clear aligners to Cupral results in the elimination of contaminating microorganisms; the antimicrobial activity is retained up to 1.25% concentration. Overall, our data describe a novel use of Cupral, a copper–calcium–hydroxide-based compound, in daily hygiene practices with promising results.;Yes;No;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e596bc1c8f542ce7736bff4cdaadc1bd19a926f

Various orthodontic devices are claimed to have different inclination control capacity. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the radiographic buccolingual inclination of upper incisors in patients treated with three different orthodontic techniques. Material and Methods Conventional brackets (Victory, 3M), self-ligating appliances (Damon Q, Ormco), and aligners (Invisalign, Align Technology) were tested. Cephalometric data of 25 patients with similar skeletal and dental pretreatment parameters were collected for each technique. Position changes of upper central incisors were assessed with radiographic evaluation before and after therapy. Three different parameters were considered: 11∧SnaSnp, 11∧Ocl and I+ TVL. All variables were measured before (T0) and after (T1) treatment and their variation over treatment was assessed. Results When evaluating angular measurements, 11∧SnaSnp and 11∧Ocl angles showed the highest numeric variation with conventional brackets. Lowest values were reported with aligners. However, the differences among various techniques were not significant for both angles (P>0.05). Also I+ TVL linear value variation did not show significant differences among the different groups tested (P>0.05).

Following up the previous proposed linear regression models, this work introduces machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) as the potential approaches to predict the electrical strength and boiling temperature. Based on a series of descriptors derived from the molecular structure of 74 molecules, the performance of three different methods: multiple linear regression, artificial neural network and random forest are compared and assessed in terms of the sensitivity to the sample size, prediction accuracy and stability, and the interpretability of predictors. Considering the available data are limited, random forest shows superior performance with higher robustness and efficiency. The same approaches were applied to the boiling temperature and random forest produced better results as well. Besides, the variable importance ranked by RF improves understanding of the correlation between the molecular properties and electrical strength. It provides important insights to analyze the properties of the SF6 substitutes during the design and synthesis of the new eco-friendly gases in power equipment.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71bcdab97a56e33fb7fd5e72411efa31b86ada75

However, due to its high Global Warming Potential (GWP), considerable effort has been undertaken to find eco-friendly replacement gases but without significant success for decades. In the study of alternative gas searching, the large number of candidate alternative gases limits the searching approach by the experiments. And in this work, different prediction models for gas electrical strength proposed by different researchers with their respective advantages are compared and concluded. Moreover, a new efficient model is developed. According to a comprehensive sample set of 73 gas species, different molecular properties are calculated based on the density functional theory. Strong correlations between electrical strength and above predictors are obtained by multiple regression. This model has a low computational cost and can be used for molecular screening of SF6 alternative gas from the point of insulation property. In addition, by studying above predictors with clear physical meaning, it can be helpful to analyze how to make considerable improvements in the electrical strength, which can prompt the process of molecular design of SF6 alternative gases.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dc90a337a6225af47e56a554fd684ec3caab1c4

Chair such everybody age. Analysis give example spend wind almost.;Newspaper level method within. Yeah most few special discussion production American. Improve letter woman perhaps since.;FullPaper;By FRANK B. LIVINGSTONE Howell's review of human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene was most thorough and timely; and his detailed outline of the geological contexts of the human fossils was particularly welcome. His article also seems to be ideal for CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY and CA* treatment, since it contains broad interpretations of the evidence, which for this period is quite fragmentary and open to a multiplicity of interpretations. Hence, the complete absence of discussion on this article is disappointing. There may be complete agreement among human paleontologists about the course of human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene; but I am sure this is not so for all physical anthropologists. As a physical anthropologist who is not an expert in human paleontology, I should like to disagree almost entirely with Howell's conclusions. Briefly, the central disagreement concerns the number of different species of hominid which existed contemporaneously in the Middle Pleistocene. Howell concludes there were two species; I insist there was but one. Although this disagreement may seem trivial, particularly in view of the great number of different taxonomies of the Hominidae, its theoretical implications are enormous. On the one hand, I maintain with Mayr (1950) and others that there has been no speciation among the Hominidae, but only phyletic evolution-i.e., different species may have succeeded one another in time, but at any one period of time only one species was extant. According to this viewpoint, the hominid lineage consists of three successive species which are usually called the Australopithecines, Pithecanthropines, and Homo. It should be noted that the term "speciation" is used to denote the branching process in evolution: a population speciates when it gives rise to two distinct descendant populations which are separate species. I would maintain that this did not occur in the hominid lineage after the Australopithecine stage. On the other hand, Howell maintains that in the Middle Pleistocene there existed two different hominid lineages of successive species and thus two different species. He places the European finds (Heidelberg, Swanscombe, and Steinheim) in one lineage; and the North African (Ternifine and Sidi Abderraham), Chinese (Choukoutien Lower Cave), and Javan (Trinil, Sangiran) finds in the other. This disagreement rests, as do most scientific arguments, upon what one accepts as evidence either for or against placing fossils into one or two species; and in this case I think the disagreement is between the "bone-oriented" scientists on Howell's side and the "theoryoriented" ones on mine. The evidence on hand includes the scraps of bones that have been uncovered and the inferences we can make as to the environment and way of life of the organism. By a minute detailed analysis of the Ternifine and Heidelberg mandibles, Howell claims to show differences which are "fundamental," and therefore indicative of two different species. To Howell and most physical anthropologists, a bump here or a centimeter there is conclusive evidence for a specific difference. However, I maintain that according to our theories, assigning these mandibles to different species makes neither ecological nor evolutionary sense, and therefore the morphological evidence is not only inconclusive but should hardly be considered, beyond the fact that the two forms were generally similar and were what we would expect a Middle Pleistocene hominid to be like. I would go even further and maintain that we shall never infer or understand the course of human evolution by comparative anatomy or detailed analyses of the miserable scraps of bone which have been found. Only by considering these scraps as living, kicking animals who thus conform to all the general laws of population ecology and evolution will we ever understand our own ascent or descent. In fairness to Howell, I should point out that his article is certainly not lacking in theory, and he does seem to accept the general proposition that spatial isolation is a necessary prerequisite for speciation among the higher mammals. Given spatial isolation, then the speed at which speciation occurs is, of course, dependent on other factors, particularly the amount of ecological divergence; but Mayr (1949) has estimated that it takes a minimum of several hundred thousand years, or roughly 30,000 human generations. If the diverging populations reestablish contact in the interim, they can mix and become one species, or one can become extinct, or they can occupy different ecological niches and by the phenomenon of character displacement become even more distinct (for a discussion of this concept in relation to the Hominidae, see Brown 1958). It does not seem to me that there was sufficient ime for the Middle Pleistocene hominids to speciate, assuming that both lineages derive from a generalized Australopithecine; and this view seems further justified by the small ecological divergence between them. Howell has shown that his two lineages were spatially isolated, one occupying Europe, and the other inhabiting an area stretching from North Africa to Java. But genetic divergence is partly a function of distance, so that similarity over such a great distance, coupled with diversity over such a short distance, would be very unexpected-particularly if there were no barriers. Howell does attempt to show that Europe was isolated from the rest of the hominid range; but with fluctuations in sea level it was not always isolated, and certainly not for the length of time required for speciation. But what seems to me to be even stronger evidence against speciation and isolation is that the North African and European groups shared the same tool traditions, while a different tradition existed in Asia. In addition to the evidence against speciation, it seems to me that the theory of "no speciation among the hominids" renders the entire fossil record more understandable and comprehensible than does any other theory. It relegates to the trashpile of obsolescence many of the old problems of human evolution, and in this way is part of a common trend in science through which questions that were considered legitimate in one decade turn out to be illegitimate in the next. For example, two problems which have continually perplexed the "hatrack" school of physical anthropology are: 1) the origin of modern racial differences; and 2) where Homo sapiens evolved and how he became distributed throughout the world in the last years of the Wuirm glaciation. As Coon (1959) has pointed out, the number of migrations required to place all human races;Yes;Yes;1961;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdc6a955d71671b39340e2fa4d08189d1c9cfa66

Main boy teacher rest hold. Table against tell quite risk. Try card campaign we sense cost myself.;FullPaper;In the course of terrace-morphological studies undertaken in the summer of 1962, geographer Dr. M. Pecsi discovered bones, flint and quartzite flakes, and a hearth embedded in a distinct layer in the travertine quarry near Vertesszollos, Hungary. The Vertesszollos travertine quarry has been known for some time in Hungarian palaeontological literature (Kretzoi 1926-27, 1941b; Schreter 1951) as a formation older than Wiirm glaciation. On a visit we found a distinct occupation site, sealed with a thick travertine shelf, a few insignificant bone fragments, and implements reminiscent of the "a spicchio" scraper. Vertesszoll6s lies 50 kilometers west of Budapest and about 15 kilometers south of the Danube (Fig. 1). On the fourth terrace of Atal6r, a rivulet reduced to the size of a brook today, travertine has long been quarried. The travertine cone, about 10-15 meters thick, is 1 of the occurences that appear at several points and different heights along a line of break running northwest-southeast on fluviatile terraces of the central range on the right bank of the Danube, between Tata and Budapest The exact correlation between the travertine and the fourth terrace overlain with loess is under examination. In this area, travertine is quarried rather irregularly, in a continuous system of pits, and at several points at the same time. The straight, somewhat southward-sloping layer, and another 4 meters of scattered traces of the continuous occupation site, can be followed over 13 meters, at 5 meters' depth, between the layers of the wall face running north-south at the southern part of the present quarry area. Excavations carried out in August, 1963, commissioned by the Hungarian National Museum, showed the succession of beds depicted in Figure 2. Uppermost is the present soil layer, sporadically broken by the pits of former travertine quarrying (1). Underneath is a layer, 2-3 meters thick, of grey, porous travertine of uneven thickness, the exact position of which is not fixed owing to the debris stuck to it (2). Underneath is a compact layer of fairly typical yellow loess (3). In the loess, especially in section A, we found mammalian bones and some implements on the base of an obliquely intercalated reddish calcareous mud layer (4). By washing we recovered mammalian bones from the loess base. A compact, continuous, 50-70 centimeter thick travertine shelf lies between the loess and the cultural horizon. The smooth surface of the shelf is clearly separated from the loess, suggesting a deposition discordancy between the 2 layers. The cultural horizon is about in the middle of a 30-50 centimeter thick, greyish calcareous layer (5), and is uniformily 5 centimeters thick (6). At the southern termination (section C), there is a small, cave-like hollow where the travertine shelf ends and the calcareous mud is directly covered with loess. Over it is a fairly wide clearage of rock and, south of the latter, a grey, spongy, fossiliferous travertine. Judging from the deposition circumstances of the calcareous mudculture horizon-loess complex, this part of the travertine is older than the cultural horizon. In a spongy, fossiliferous, older travertine underlying the yellowish-grey calcareous mud, which is interrupted sporadically by 5-10 centimeter thick calcareous intercalations, we found mammalian fauna by washing from 2 layers below the cultural horizon, at levels of 2, 4, and 5 meters respectively. We recovered some implements and bone fragments in section A from loess above the cultural horizon and, north of it, from a similarly higher level layer of reddish calcareous mud. The type of fauna suggests that these implements belong to Mindel IT, but they do not differ from those of the main layer. South of section C, at the level of the occupation site, were some quartzite chips. A final stratigraphy will be obtained only through major planned excavations; but on the basis of similarities to a dwelling place found at Tata (Vertes et al. 1964), it seems that Early Man settled here on a travertine-tettarata base that had remained dry. This presumption is supported by the aquatic origin (water molluscs) of the calcareous mud. The covering travertine shelf and the loess are subsequent aggradations in this basin; the amount of water that was instrumental in the formation of the upper travertine did not wash away the incoherent loess from its position in the basin surrounded by calcareous tuff walls. To get sufficient information on stratigraphical conditions and to collect archaeological and palaeontological material for the determination of the culture and age we excavated for a week, exposing 2-2.5 meters. On the northern part of the profile divided into sections (section A), we both dug up and blasted down to the cultural horizon (a length of 5 meters and a width of 1.5 meters, starting from the surface). This exposed a narrow strip of the site, since the covering layers arched over considerably. Part of the cultural horizon was investigated on the spot, part of it washed in the museum. A sizable number of specimens were collected from several points, of the loess and from the 2 deeper layers of calcareous mud. We collected about 700 quartzite, flint, and chert objects that can be classified in the implement group, nearly 2,000 pieces (3,000 grams) of waste products, a nuimber of mostly indeterminable mammalian bones and teeth, about 2,000 grams of thoroughly 'burnt bone fragments, as well as malacofauna and pollen samples. The material is being examined by a team. Classification of the material exposed by major excavations in The spring of 1964 will take much time, and years might pass before a comprehensive monograph is published.

Option carry keep picture group however.;Poster;The sixth skull cap of Pithecanthropus erectus (or skull V, since the Modjokerto skull has not been given a number) was found in the upper layers of the Trinil beds of Sangiran (Central Java) in 1963, associated with fossils of the Sino-Malayan fauna. No stone tools were discovered in direct association with the find. ,  ,  ,  , The specimen consists of the occipital, both parietals, both temporals, sphenoid fragments, the frontal and the left zygomatic bone. We consider the skull to be a male in his early twenties. The occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal bones demonstrate definite pithecanthropine characteristics, and the cranial capacity is estimated to be 975 cm3. ,  ,  ,  , Of the superstructures, the supraorbital torus is extraodinarily thick, approaching the condition in Australopithecus boisei and Rhodesian man. And the sagittal torus is certainly higher than in skulls I and II, but lower than in skull IV. In addition, the angle between the occipital and nuchal planes is larger than in the previous finds. As revealed by various features, the gap between the robustness of skull IV on one hand, and skulls I, II and III on the other, is bridged by the present find. There is no reasonable taxonomic need to ascribe this specimen to a new species, because it seems to be merely an intrapopulational variant of the same species. ,  ,  ,  , Other skulls of P. erectus suggest that the bregmatic eminence, and hence the vertex, is invariably situated at bregma, but this new skull cap deviates from the pattern. Its pteric regions disclose the anthropoid X and I types. The middle meningeal groove pattern is similar to other Pithecanthropus skulls; however, it betrays a known anomaly in that the main stem is covered for a short distance by a bony plate. The mastoid process is fairly well developed, and is also well pneumatized as in P. pekinensis, with its air cells invading the pronounced supramastoid crest. ,  ,  ,  , The zygomatic bone, the first one recovered of P. erectus, does not show characters of particular importance. In fact, its thickness is in the range of modern man. ,  ,  ,  , We would like to stress that the absence of the cranial base does not necessarily indicate that the specimen must be a poor victim of cannibalism, since the morphology of the base renders it more susceptible to post-mortem natural traumata.;Yes;Yes;1966;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70fe160f6f227658845dbcb504aecaa926105271

Methods Specimens were fabricated using four types of thermoplastic materials with different thicknesses under a thermal vacuum. Transparency, water absorption and solubility, surface hardness, and the results of three-point bending and tensile tests were evaluated before and after thermoforming. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test. Results After thermoforming, the transparency of Duran and Essix A+ decreased, while the water absorption ability of all materials; the water solubility of Duran, Essix A+, and Essix ACE; and the surface hardness of Duran and Essix A+ increased. The flexure modulus for the 0.5-mm-thick Duran, Essix A+, and eCligner specimens increased, whereas that for the 0.75-/1.0-mm-thick Duran and eClginer specimens decreased. In addition, the elastic modulus increased for the 0.5-mm-thick Essix A+ specimens and decreased for the 0.75-mm-thick Duran and Essix ACE and the 1.0-mm-thick Essix ACE specimens. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used for the fabrication of TOAs should be evaluated after thermoforming in order to characterize their properties for clinical application.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41bb431139cb8ece8ed3ad71195222d1dae7a2bf

About 50 years later, von Koenigswald found another series of Pithecanthropus remains in the Sangiran area, Central Java (Fig. 1). In the past few years other fossils of Pithecanthropus have been found by villagers in the Sangiran dome area (see Table 1). I shall attempt here to summarize briefly these recent finds. 1) Mandible C. This mandible was found in November 1960 near the village of Mlandingan (Fig. 1) on the surface of a hill slope entirelv composed of rocks belonging to the Putjangan formation. In the surrounding area were discovered vertebrate bones, among others those of Bibos palaesondaicus. A test excavation done on this site in 1963 resulted in fossil fragments of deer and Hippopotamus sp. Sartono (1961) has proposed the designation mandible C for this specimen, considering the Kedung Brubus jaw, discovered in 1890, as A and the Sangiran jaw discovered in 1936 as B (Weidenreich 1945). 2 He believes that the new mandible was probably deposited in a marine environment during fossilization, since foraminifera were found in its matrix of marly material. The specimen closely resembles mandible B. It is highly fossilized and consists of the right half of the corpus, containing five teeth, namely the canine, the premolars, and the second and third molars (Figs. 2-3).

We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Quality assessment of the included articles was performed. Two authors were responsible for study selection, validity assessment and data extraction., , , RESULTS, Four controlled clinical trials including a total of 252 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. We grouped the trials into four main comparisons. One randomized controlled trial was classified as level 1B evidence, and three cohort studies were classified as level 2B evidence. Clear aligners appear to have a significant advantage with regard to chair time and treatment duration in mild-to-moderate cases based on several cross-sectional studies. No other differences in stability and occlusal characteristics after treatment were found between the two systems., , , CONCLUSIONS, Despite claims about the effectiveness of clear aligners, evidence is generally lacking.

Two basically conflicting views have prevailed, one asserting that races developed as local variations in a species evolving phyletically over much of the Old World for up to one million years, and the other view holding that present races are local variations on populations recently expanding into most areas and replacing the previous hominid inhabitants, this occurring since the time of the Neanderthals. Both views are based on the same archeological data. Gene frequency data and time-calibrated genetic distance measures have recently been applied to this problem. Here we show that the probable demographic nature of Pleistocene populations has obscured genetic distances to such an extent that they cannot be used to discriminate between the two viewpoints of racial origins.

In this paper, a new 3D model based designing technique is introduced by which the 3D movements of the teeth (including the roots) can be designed, followed, and kept under control during the whole rehabilitation process. The follow-up of the implementation of the orthodontic treatment planning is important not only when determining the location of the tooth crown but because it enables to carry out the radiation-free monitoring of the planned treatments precisely mapped based on the anatomic aptitudes. This results in the continuous determination of the positions of roots and of their correlation with each other which is an essential condition in regards to the stability of the treatment outcome.;No;Yes;2017;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ea9d7788bb22df3e4b0e2f7f415404b53f7b388

After we reflected a full-thickness flap beyond the teeth apices, the cortical bone was exposed on the buccal aspect and a modified corticotomy procedure was performed. Interproximal corticotomy cuts were extended through the entire thickness of the cortical layer, just barely penetrating into medullary bone. Orthodontic force was applied on the teeth immediately after surgery., , , RESULTS, Total treatment time was 2 months. Periodontal indexes were improved after correction of crowding.

Since its introduction, Invisalign system has become a popular treatment choice for the clinicians because of the aesthetics and comfort of the removable clear aligners compared with the traditional appliances. Therefore, the aim of the present report was to illustrate the management of a malocclusion by means of Invisalign system associated with the traditional surgical technique. The present paper shows a case of a 23-year-old male patient characterized by a Class III malocclusion with lateral deviation of the mandible to the left side and cross-bite on teeth 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. Invisalign system was used during the pre- and postsurgical phases rather than fixed appliances. The posttreatment cephalometric analysis emphasized the stability of the dental and skeletal symmetry corrections, occlusion and functional balance, over a 6-year follow-up. The results achieved at the end of the treatment showed how Invisalign can be effective in the management of the orthodontic phases in orthognathic surgery. The follow-up after 6 years emphasizes the stability of the treatment over time.;Yes;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e06bee6928ffd29a1974d1c236d92366ef91ae6d

Renewable Energy Harvesting (REH) plays a critical role in managing this demand response gap, where energy is generated from various renewable energy resources such as Solar PhotoVoltaic (SPV) and wind energy. Several research works exist in this regard. However, they have not yet been exploited fully. So, this paper proposed AI-RSREH approach, i.e., the AI-empowered Recommender System for REH in residential houses. The main goal of the proposed AI-RSREH approach is to predict energy generation based on SPV accurately, and this study aims to minimize the gap between the actual generation of energy and the predicted energy generation along with a recommender system for SPV installation. An exploratory residential house-wise data analytics is conducted for the demand response gap. AI-RSREH uses a stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict energy generation with a recommender system based on the energy generation prediction result. The obtained results show the efficacy of the proposed approach compared to the existing methods with respect to parameters such as SPV installation in residential houses and prediction accuracy.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0836b362249494fe2623eb56aca28aaade93cd9

Final effect send and key amount party.;ShortPaper;In this paper, a brief survey of data preprocessing methods is presented. Specifically, the data preprocessing methods used in the smart grid (SG) domain are surveyed. Also, with the advent of SG, data collection on a large scale became possible. The data is essential for electricity demand, generation and price forecasting, which plays an important role in making energy efficient decisions, and long and short term predictions regarding energy generation, consumption and storage. However, the forecasting accuracy decreases when data is used in raw form. Hence, data preprocessing is considered essential. This paper provides an overview of the data preprocessing methods and a detailed discussion of the methods used in the existing literature. A comparison of the methods is also given. A survey of closely related survey papers is also presented and the papers are compared based on their contributions. Moreover, based on the discussion of the data preprocessing methods, a narrative is built with a critical analysis. Finally, future research directions are discussed to guide the readers.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6f89bd6c88bd4dec4188791c1655dc87fa890d1

Cleaning bad data is thus necessary for the situational analysis of a data-based power system. Methods for the identification and modification of bad data based on state estimation may fail to converge in iterative calculations, and yield poor results when the errors are significant. State estimation also involves non-linear computation, which incurs a significant computational overhead and makes it difficult to efficiently handle large volumes of data. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a method for the detection and identification of bad data based on constraints on spatial–temporal correlation. In the spatial domain, we fix the equivalent power balance condition through the topology of the network. In sequential distribution, we establish data constraints based on the similarity of data among temporal sections. We then check the data in combination with the spatial–temporal correlation constraints. The proposed method was applied to an IEEE 14-bus system and a provincial grid, and the results show that it can reliably detect and modify bad data to significantly improve their quality. The proposed approach avoids non-linear calculations, is computationally efficient, and can quickly detect and modify bad data.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fc3984a01b5a2cb3eafa974ea1fcb30ca2bb26

All patients were evaluated by using methods from the American Board of Orthodontics Phase III examination. The discrepancy index was used to analyze pretreatment records to control for initial severity of malocclusion. The objective grading system was used to systematically grade posttreatment records. The Wilcoxon 2-sample tests were used to evaluate treatment outcome of Invisalign and braces., , , RESULTS, The total mean scores of the objective grading system categories were improved after treatment in both groups. The improvements were not statistically significant in scores for alignment, marginal ridges, occlusal relations, over jet, inter-proximal contacts, and root angulation. Invisalign scores were consistently lower than braces scores for buccolingual inclination and occlusal contacts., , , CONCLUSIONS, The overall improvement in OGS scores indicate that both Invisalign and fixed appliances were successful in treating Class I adult extraction cases in this sample.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f11e3f987715f4a65a172e55a6f2fc72d1b13c7

The purpose of this paper is to take five topics and match the perceptions with the scientific evidence. The variety of appliances and the swings in treatment philosophy have been dramatic, including the swing from extraction to non-extraction therapy, the introduction of space-age wires, appliances that grow mandibles, the introduction and extraordinary growth of Invisalign, and reduced friction brackets to reduce treatment time, all with claims by manufacturers of better results than ever before. The focus is on faster treatment, reduced visits/appointments and superior results. Most of these 'advancements' represent what has been the 'juggernaut of technology'.

Care kid as outside.;ShortPaper;,  For fault failures of a steam turbine occur frequently and cause huge losses, it is important to identify the fault category. A steam turbine clustering fault diagnosis method based on t-distribution stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed. Firstly, the t-SNE algorithm is used to map high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space, and data clustering is performed in low-dimensional space. Combined with the fault records of the power plant, the fault data and health data of the clustering result are distinguished. Then, the imbalance problem in the data is processed by the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm to obtain the steam turbine characteristic data set with fault labels. Finally, we used the XGBoost to solve this multiclassification problem. In the experiment, the method achieved the best performance with an overall accuracy of 97% and early warning at least two hours in advance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively evaluate the state and make fault warning for power plant equipment.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85c4e398e7ea3ba52ee1eb04e62be3957c2f54aa

Too model government discover commercial what seven.;ShortPaper;Three aspects have had a significant impact on orthodontics during the last few decades: the appliances being used, the anchorage being used and finally the distribution of patients being treated. Firstly, the marketing of appliances is increasingly leading the orthodontist to outsource important aspects of treatment such as wirebending and bracket positioning. Brackets and wires are being presented as the solution to all problems and metaphysical terms such as ‘intelligent design,’ ‘working brackets’ and ‘intelligent wires’ are dominating advertising and reducing the impact of evidence-based treatment approaches. Secondly, the introduction of skeletal anchorage has potentially widened the spectrum of orthodontics, allowing for treatments that could not be done with conventional appliances. Biomechanical knowledge is, however, mandatory if we agree that the system should not be abused. Thirdly, the orthodontic population comprises an increasing number of adult patients, many of whom are characterized by a degenerated dentition. The treatment of these patients requires a thorough knowledge not only of biomechanics but also of the reaction of the periodontal tissues to various types of loading. They can be treated only with custom-made appliances adapting the force systems and magnitude to the patient-specific treatment goal. In summary, the orthodontic world is being split between ‘appliance-driven fast-food orthodontics’ where the results to a large extent are dependent on both growth and function and ‘orthodontist-driven’ ‘slow-food’ treatments attempting to push the limits of the possible in relation to complicated problems and reversal of degeneration in adult patients. The latter treatments are performed with individualized appliances adapting the force system to the patient. This paper will attempt to summarize the bearing of these factors on present orthodontics.;Yes;No;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/704020e85faa89d84a78a41c03884bd4e0f785f9

All subjects presented a Class I malocclusion with mild crowding in a permanent dentition, without craniofacial anomalies, missing teeth or a history of orthodontic treatment. Dento-alveolar measurements were made on the maxillary dental casts at T0 and T1. Significant differences between the treated groups were assessed with Independent Samples t test (p<0.05)., , , RESULTS, Statistically significant differences between self-ligating sample and Invisalign group were recorded for CWC, FPWF, FPWL, SPWF, SPWL, and AP measurements. No significant changes were found for CWL, MWF, MWL, and AD values. There was not a statistically significant difference between the treatment durations of the groups: 1.8 years for both patients. These data suggest that Invisalign treatment cannot be somewhat faster than fixed appliances. Moreover the final occlusion might not be as ideal., , , CONCLUSIONS, The low fiction self-ligating system produced statistically significant different outcomes in the transverse dento-alveolar width and the perimeter of the maxillary arch during treatment when compared to Invisalign tecnique.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aed51ba33da974b2a36c366f8bb5566f340cdaef

The Clear Aligner is a procedure that can be performed by either an orthodontist or a general dentist without computer simulation/calculation. Since the Clear Aligner is fabricated from the stone model for new appliance at each or every other appointment, it is readily available to change the treatment sequence throughout the course of the treatment. The patient can receive any necessary dental procedures with ease during the course of the treatment. The treatment can also be easily resumed even if the patient has not worn the aligners for a period of time. The purpose of this article is to report dental anterior crossbite correction with a series of Clear Aligners.

Leader subject way what example. Suddenly hotel month best conference four bad apply.;Near though air account seem after certainly bar. Throw go close light few., Training beyond street defense positive put. Particularly court along need media sit. Yet great figure music past.;Poster;In this report, three patients were treated with a new treatment protocol for Invisalign to demonstrate that a variety of complex malocclusions can be successfully treated using this protocol, including correction of moderate crowding, correction of moderate Class II division 1, and deep overbite. Previous studies of Invisalign showed significant limitations for more complex orthodontic treatment, although a few recent case reports have shown successfully completed moderate to difficult orthodontic malocclusions. One reason for the discrepancy is that the earlier studies were done during the first four years of the appliance development (now ten years of clinical use), when significant problems existed with accomplishing bodily movement, torquing of roots, extrusions, and rotations of premolars and canines. The new protocol included new methods for anterior/posterior corrections, showing on the computer the effect of elastics for Class II treatment simulated as a one-stage anterior/posterior movement at the end of treatment. Staging for interproximal reduction (IPR) is now automatically staged when there is better access to interproximal contacts to avoid IPR where significant overlap between teeth is present to avoid performing IPR on surfaces that may be damaged by instruments such as burs, strips, and disks when cut on a sharp angle. Staging for tooth movements is now also done to enable combination movements to occur simultaneously for each tooth with the tooth that needs to move the most (the lead tooth) determining the minimum number of stages required. All other teeth move at a slower rate than the lead tooth throughout the duration of treatment. Attachments are now placed in the middle of the crown automatically for rotation and automatically sized in proportion to the clinical crown. Use of 1 mm thick (buccal-lingual dimension) horizontal beveled rectangular attachments is standard on premolars for retention of aligners during intrusive movements, such as leveling the lower curve of Spee in deep overbite for extrusions and for control of the tooth long axis during torquing movements. Staging of tooth movements now track linear and rotational velocities of teeth separately with the number of treatment stages determined by the lead tooth based on its rotational or linear maximum velocities at no more than two degrees of rotation per stage. Simultaneous movements are done for all teeth providing visible space (approximately 0.05 mm) between teeth during movements past other teeth using expansion instead of IPR as a primary way to increase space available for correction of crowding.;No;Yes;2008;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af58dc4055527be0437c29d28832e1b43ffcbc9b

Two groups of patients were identified that differed only in the method of treatment (Invisalign and Braces group). Dental casts and panoramic radiographs were collected and analyzed using the objective grading system (OGS) of the American Board of Orthodontics (ABO). The cases were evaluated immediately after appliance removal (T1) and at a postretention time (T2), three years after appliance removal. All patients had completed active orthodontic treatment and had undergone at least one year of retention. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate differences in treatment outcomes between the groups for each of the eight categories in the OGS, including four additional subcategories in the alignment category. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine the significance of changes within each group from T1 to T2., , , RESULTS, The change in the total alignment score in the Invisalign group was significantly larger than that for the Braces group. There were significant changes in total alignment and mandibular anterior alignment in both groups. There were significant changes in maxillary anterior alignment in the Invisalign group only., , , CONCLUSIONS, In this sample for this period of observation, patients treated with Invisalign relapsed more than those treated with conventional fixed appliances.;Yes;Yes;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40ff2050cdaa66359f9f6b10665a4f7727ab697f

No studies have investigated the inclusion of a three-dimensional (3-D) charting interface in a general dental record., , , METHODS, A multidisciplinary research team with expertise in human-computer interaction, dental informatics and computer science conducted a 14-week project to develop and evaluate a proof of concept for a 3-D dental record. Through several iterations of paper- and computer-based prototypes, the project produced a high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype that was evaluated by two dentists and two dental students., , , RESULTS, The project implemented a prototypical patient record built around a 3-D model of a patient's maxillofacial structures. Novel features include automatic retrieval of images and radiographs; a flexible view of teeth, soft tissue and bone; access to historical patient data through a timeline; and the ability to focus on a single tooth., , , CONCLUSIONS, Users tests demonstrated acceptance for the basic design of the prototype, but also identified several challenges in developing intuitive, easy-to-use navigation methods and hi-fi representations in a 3-D record., , , CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS, Test participants in this project accepted the preliminary design of a 3-D dental record.

Should responsibility who safe like.;South guess organization training skin near child work. Into see oil whatever nothing must north grow. Agent expert young.;DemoPaper;Advances in all aspects of science and discovery continue to occur at an exponential rate, leading to a wealth of new knowledge and technologies that have the potential to transform dental practice. This "new science" within the areas of cell/ molecular biology, genetics, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and informatics has been available for several years; however, the assimilation of this information into the dental curriculum has been slow. For the profession and the patients it serves to benefit fully from modern science, new knowledge and technologies must be incorporated into the mainstream of dental education. The continued evolution of the dental curriculum presents a major challenge to faculty, administrators, and external constituencies because of the high cost, overcrowded schedule, unique demands of clinical training, changing nature of teaching/assessment methods, and large scope of new material impacting all areas of the educational program. Additionally, there is a lack of personnel with adequate training/experience in both foundational and clinical sciences to support the effective application and/or integration of new science information into curriculum planning, implementation, and assessment processes. Nonetheless, the speed of this evolution must be increased if dentistry is to maintain its standing as a respected health care profession. The influence of new science on dental education and the dental curriculum is already evident in some dental schools. For example, the Marquette University School of Dentistry has developed a comprehensive model of curriculum revision that integrates foundational and clinical sciences and also provides a dedicated research/scholarly track and faculty development programming to support such a curriculum. Educational reforms at other dental schools are based on addition of new curricular elements and include innovative approaches that introduce concepts regarding new advances in science, evidence-based foundations, and translational research. To illustrate these reforms, the Marquette curriculum and initiatives at the University of Connecticut and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio dental schools are described in this article, with recognition that other dental schools may also be developing strategies to infuse new science and evidence-based critical appraisal skills into their students' educational experiences. Discussion of the rationale, goals/objectives, and outcomes within the context of dissemination of these models should help other dental schools to design approaches for integrating this new material that are appropriate to their particular circumstances and mission. For the profession to advance, every dental school must play a role in establishing a culture that attaches value to research/discovery, evidence-based practice, and the application of new knowledge/technologies to patient care.;Yes;No;2007;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6df90b0348cd5d9fbf0e8a163d6e04f12490c257

Diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by family physicians and pediatricians was most commonly based on brief behavioral descriptions by parents and, infrequently, by use of rating scales. At that time, the present researchers began to explore the development of a school-based, methodologically sound, and inexpensive method of assessing the efficacy of stimulant medications, which would ensure reasonable compliance by teachers, parents, and students in monitoring the effects of medications and placebos. This article focuses on the methodological issues involved in choosing instruments to monitor behavior, once a comprehensive evaluation has suggested trials on Ritalin. Case examples illustrate problems of teacher compliance in filling out measures, supplying adequate placebos, and obtaining physician cooperation, and with the practical issue of providing adequate data without overwhelming the time and resources of participants.

Peptic ulcer disease in dyspeptic patients, 24.5%, was comparable to prevalence of gastro-duodenal disease among symptomatic individuals in developed countries (12 - 25%). Limited data exists regarding its associated risk factors despite accumulating evidence indicating that gastroduodenal disease is common in Ghana., , , OBJECTIVES, This study investigates risk factors associated with gastro-duodenal disease at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana., , , METHODS, This study utilized a cross-sectional design to consecutively recruit patients referred with upper gastro-intestinal symptoms for endoscopy. The study questionnaire was administered to study participants. Helicobacter pylori infection was confirmed by rapid-urease examination at endoscopy., , , RESULTS, Of 242 patients sampled; 64 had duodenal ulcer, 66 gastric ulcer, 27gastric cancer and 64 non-ulcer dyspepsia. Nineteen (19) had duodenal and gastric ulcer while 2 had gastric ulcer and cancer. A third (32.6%) of patients had history of NSAID-use. H. pyloriwas associated with gastric ulcer (p=0.033) and duodenal ulcer (p=0.001). There was an increased prevalence of duodenal ulcer in H. pylori-infected patients taking NSAIDs, P=0.003., , , CONCLUSION, H. pylori was a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease.

Who by up.;ShortPaper;Objective To present results of the Kyoto Global Consensus Meeting, which was convened to develop global consensus on (1) classification of chronic gastritis and duodenitis, (2) clinical distinction of dyspepsia caused by Helicobacter pylori from functional dyspepsia, (3) appropriate diagnostic assessment of gastritis and (4) when, whom and how to treat H. pylori gastritis. Design Twenty-three clinical questions addressing the above-mentioned four domains were drafted for which expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements. A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as ≥80%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto. Results All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions after extensive modifications and omission of one clinical question were achieved with a consensus level of >80%. To better organise classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on aetiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia together with a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimise the risk of more serious complications of the infection. Conclusions A global consensus for gastritis was developed for the first time, which will be the basis for an international classification system and for further research on the subject.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40d8add5cb9fc1d48b61bf721d8a7596ce2f1498

Genetic factors, physiological functions, and environmental factors may determine the relative importance of various pathophysiological mechanisms. This study was designed to determine the histological alterations in the duodenal mucosa of Nigerian patients with FD. Methods Consecutive patients with dyspepsia seen over a 27-month period in two gastrointestinal endoscopy facilities in Enugu, South-East Nigeria were further evaluated with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal mucosal biopsies if no lesion was found in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with heartburn and/or regurgitation who did not have any dyspeptic symptoms and did not have any lesion in the upper gastrointestinal tract on endoscopy were presumed to have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and they served as controls. The control subjects also had duodenal biopsies. The histopathological findings in the cases and controls were compared. Results There were 68 patients with FD and 52 patients with NERD. The total inflammatory score was 242 in FD and 66 in NERD (Mann-Whitney U =1168, P=0.0011). Similarly, the scores for chronic inflammation, gastric metaplasia, neutrophilic activity, eosinophilic infiltration, and Helicobacter pylori were significantly higher in FD than NERD. Conclusion Functional dyspepsia is associated with a high degree of inflammation in the duodenal mucosa. This may reflect the high prevalence of gastrointestinal infections in a tropical environment such as Nigeria. These findings may have therapeutic potential that further studies might elucidate.;Yes;No;2013;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca5ee83cd41747250f01c4010313423ec1c78342

Establishing an Asian consensus for functional dyspepsia is crucial in order to attract attention to such data from Asian countries, to articulate the experience and views of Asian experts, and to provide a relevant guide on management of functional dyspepsia for primary care physicians working in Asia. Methods Consensus team members were selected from Asian experts and consensus development was carried out using a modified Delphi method. Consensus teams collected published papers on functional dyspepsia especially from Asia and developed candidate consensus statements based on the generated clinical questions. At the first face-to-face meeting, each statement was reviewed and e-mail voting was done twice. At the second face-to-face meeting, final voting on each statement was done using keypad voting system. A grade of evidence and a strength of recommendation were applied to each statement according to the method of the GRADE Working Group. Results Twenty-nine consensus statements were finalized, including 7 for definition and diagnosis, 5 for epidemiology, 9 for pathophysiology and 8 for management. Algorithms for diagnosis and management of functional dyspepsia were added. Conclusions This consensus developed by Asian experts shows distinctive features of functional dyspepsia in Asia and will provide a guide to the diagnosis and management of functional dyspepsia for Asian primary care physicians.;No;Yes;2012;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55326da50d5f8b945f7382ae2797c0e731247fe1

Although treatment with methylphenidate made probands less easily distinguished from their peers (normalization), many children still scored in the deviant range for at least one ADHD behavior when receiving the 0.5-mg/kg dose. There was little evidence that peer behavior improved as a function of the proband's dose of medication., , , CONCLUSIONS, Although conventional doses of methylphenidate produced dramatic clinical improvement in ADHD-related behavior, complete behavioral normalization is often not attained.;Yes;Yes;1997;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4556b5d36369c2c96ad7ca2cf96adae081ae473d

Control effort different run officer., Force customer message lay remember include degree.;FullPaper;Objectives: The objective of the study was to ascertain the appropriateness of indications for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy in children with dyspepsia. Methods: We used the RAND/University of California at Los Angeles method to investigate the appropriateness of the opinions of a panel of experts. The panel judged 2304 theoretical patient scenarios defined by a combination of demographic and clinical variables. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: The panel rated UGI endoscopy as appropriate in 27.2% of cases, inappropriate in 14.3%, and dubious in 58.5%. Disagreement emerged for 21% of cases. UGI endoscopy was considered increasingly appropriate in cases with a positive family history of peptic ulcer and/or Helicobacter pylori infection (odds ratio [OR] 8.518, P < 0.0001), when dyspepsia interfered with activities of daily living (“sleep” OR 7.540, P < 0.0001; “normal activities” OR 5.725, P < 0.0001), and when patients were older than 10 years (“≤10 years” OR 0.310, P < 0.0001) the longer the duration (“0–2 months” OR 0.002, P < 0.0001; “3–5 months” OR 0.059, P < 0.0001; “6–11 months” OR 0.516, P = 0.0005) and the greater the severity (“mild” OR 0.002, P < 0.0001; “moderate” OR 0.013, P < 0.0001) of their dyspeptic symptoms. Conclusions: UGI endoscopy is not appropriate for all children with dyspeptic symptoms, but only for cases with a family history of peptic ulcer and/or Helicobacter pylori infection, older than 10 years of age, with symptoms persisting for more than 6 months and severe enough to affect activities of daily living.;Yes;Yes;2010;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9fb9659797a77c9c9b81ad39a59be200cbf835bc

Result stay move situation wonder she network cup. Fact test red physical stop.;ShortPaper;Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic, psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the pharmacology of aggression (FIG. 1). Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach. Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder, adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression It remains less clear that medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication intervention (FIG. 1). When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended. Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric efficacy in reducing aggression (TABLE 1) and that have a favorable safety profile. Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile. Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents, propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric aggression. These medications may offer effective and less toxic alternatives in the pharmacologic treatment of inappropriate excessive childhood aggression.;Yes;Yes;1996;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a29ed3b517f86fc291a9a112da3107d7ce5ac64

Treatment effects were assessed using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and using rating scales completed by the parents, teachers, and physician., , , RESULTS, Methylphenidate effectively suppressed hyperactive, disruptive, and aggressive behavior. There was no evidence that methylphenidate altered the severity of tic disorder, but it may have a weak effect on the frequency of motor (increase) and vocal (decrease) tics., , , CONCLUSION, Methylphenidate appears to be a safe and effective treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the majority of children with comorbid tic disorder.;Yes;No;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77d4ed0918d5d7be8cf2469d68f71abcd987f921

Even administration capital for owner.;Poster;OBJECTIVES, To evaluate the pattern of prescribing antidepressant (AD) drugs by British child psychiatrists with particular emphasis on the impact of newer-type (heterocyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) agents on this practice and to assess the safety of AD use for children in terms of clinicians' reports of adverse effects., , , METHOD, A short postal survey asking specific questions about these aspects of their clinical practice was sent to 350 British child psychiatrists., , , RESULTS, The response rate was 71%. A clear majority of the 238 respondents (85%) who provided analyzable reports had prescribed ADs, the most popular of these being amitriptyline and imipramine, although nearly one third of prescribers also used newer agents occasionally and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors specifically, very rarely indeed. British child psychiatrists issued only one or two new prescriptions for AD medication per year. ADs were being used for a wide range of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders beyond the product data sheet-recommended indications of "depression" and "nocturnal enuresis." High rates of mostly mild adverse effects were reported in children treated with older-type ADs; however, the use of newer ADs did not appear to have influenced this picture when the reports of prescribers of only older ADs were compared with reports of those who also prescribed newer agents., , , CONCLUSIONS, Despite a willingness to use this form of treatment, British child psychiatrists tend to use it very sparingly compared to practices revealed in American studies. The preferential and infrequent use of older AD agents may account for the high rates of adverse effects reported. These practices do not allow clinicians to become familiar with, and thus more comfortable about, using newer agents.;Yes;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2da625564e960abefe4deb6c7cddb665fdffa1e9

Part 2 addressed the question to what extent MPH might ameliorate these deficits. Hyperactive clinical responders (n = 30) and nonresponders (n = 28) to MPH, were compared to normal controls (n = 27) on selective and sustained attention tasks and on conventional psychological and neurological measures. The responders took part in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. They ingested a placebo (PL) or MPH (0.3-0.6 mg/kg/day) during 4 weeks, and were then tested. After crossover, another period of 4 weeks was concluded by a second test series. Compared to controls, both responders and nonresponders showed attention deficits in encoding, memory search, and decision operations, as well as in focused and sustained attention, vigilance, and use of feedback. These deficits were the most severe in the responders. Anamnestic data, IQ scores, and neurological variables did not discriminate between groups. MPH selectively alleviates attention deficits. MPH did not affect divided attention, except for an increased accuracy of response organization.

H. pylori-infected children with recurrent abdominal pain generally do not require treatment. However, benefit of treatment has been known to produce dramatic improvements in some patients. Furthermore, H. pylori-infected is associated with growth retardation, iron deficiency anemia and thrombocytopenia. The objective of this study was to find suggestive parameters for eradication of H. pylori gastritis. From 1992 to 2004, medical records of 42 children diagnosed as having H. pylori infection by endoscopy were retrospectively reviewed. Of those 42 patients, there were 36 patients with H. pylori gastritis without gastric or duodenal ulcer (85.7%), and 6 patients with ulcers (14.3%). Children with H. pylori gastritis were divided into 2 groups: responsive and unresponsive. Data including the duration of abdominal pain, endoscopic finding, histology, treatment, outcome and final diagnosis were collected. Additional data were obtained by telephone and letters. Of 36 patients, there were 24 and 12 patients in responsive and unresponsive groups, respectively. Three patients with anemia were all presented in the responsive group. Those experiencing abdominal pain less than 3 months more commonly belonged to the responsive group (P = 0.21). Marked erythema of gastric mucosa was only seen in the responsive group (P = 0.136). All cases of chronic moderate-active gastritis appeared in the responsive group (p = 0.03). In conclusion, iron deficiency anemia and chronic moderate-active gastritis should be the suggestive parameters for eradication therapy in children with H. pylori gastritis.;Yes;Yes;2005;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/609cd3c725d5eb05841be73d1791bfb520f687d5

Gastric emptying of radiolabelled solid meal was determined at baseline and during the third month., , , RESULTS, The Helicobacter pylori eradication rate was 79% and symptom scores significantly decreased during the follow-up period in both of the groups, irrespective of Helicobacter pylori status. The mean symptom scores of the 24 patients at baseline, day 15 and and months three and six were as follows: 1.275, 0.274, 0.496 and 0.238 respectively. Symptom scores for the 19 patients with Helicobacter pylori eradication were 1.084, 0.263, 0.347 and 0.215 respectively while in the five patients in whom Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy failed it was 2.0, 0.314, 1.06 and 0.32 respectively. Of the 16.6% Helicobacter pylori positive non-ulcer dyspepsia patients who had delayed gastric emptying of solids, there was no change after eradication therapy. Nine patients, including all of those in whom eradication therapy failed, required further medication (antacids/prokinetics) for continuing symptoms one month after completion of treatment., , , CONCLUSIONS, The results of this study suggest that Helicobacter pylori is a causal factor in symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia and that eradication therapy improves symptoms and endoscopic findings but has no effect on gastric emptying.;Yes;Yes;2002;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa59c0503eb02d5af745ecbbae937cecf13f4249

Results were contrasted with a normal control sample., , , RESULTS, Standard statistical analysis revealed MPH effects on classroom functioning that were primarily linear. Analysis of the clinical significance of effects indicated that large proportions of treated children exhibited significantly improved or normalized classroom functioning; however, a large subset of them failed to show improved academic functioning. Overall, children failing to respond at lower dose levels have a high probability of improving or becoming normalized as a function of increasing dose., , , CONCLUSIONS, For a majority of children with ADDH, MPH results in significantly improved or normalized attention and classroom behavior.

This prospective study attempted to determine the independent risk factors for ulcer formation in NUD patients, and compared the natural history of Helicobacter pylori positive and negative NUD subjects. Methods: From May 1997 to April 1999, consecutive NUD patients were enrolled into the study. Endoscopy was performed routinely on enrolment, at the end of the second and 12th months, and whenever there was a dyspepsia attack. Patients were prospectively followed up for two years. Results: Peptic ulcers occurred in 16 of 209 NUD patients during the two year follow up period. Multivariate analysis of 13 host and bacterial factors demonstrated that advanced age (odds ratio 2.90), H pylori infection (odds ratio 3.59), and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; odds ratio 4.46) were independently significant in predicting subsequent peptic ulcer development. NUD patients with all three risk factors had a 75% (3/4) risk of developing peptic ulcer but the ulcer incidence in patients without any of the risk parameters was only 1.2% (1/84). The resolution rate of symptoms in the H pylori positive NUD patients was similar to the H pylori negative patients (57.9% v 49.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) −5 to 22). However, rates for subsequent peptic ulcer and erosion development were significantly higher in H pylori positive patients than in H pylori negative patients (ulcer 12.6% v 3.5%, 95% CI 1–16; erosion 23.2% v 12.3%, 95% CI 1–21). Conclusion: A small but significant proportion of NUD patients develop peptic ulcer after long term follow up. H pylori infection, NSAID use, and advanced age are independent risk factors for subsequent ulcer formation. Follow up endoscopy is strongly indicated for an NUD patient with multiple risk factors for ulcer formation when symptoms recur.;Yes;Yes;2002;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac1f725f52b5d52ae62b6ec5ea443df351c9071d

Patients medicated by clinic psychiatrists were significantly more likely than nonmedicated patients to be psychotic and to have been hospitalized previously, and significantly less likely to have adjustment disorder. Using standards employed by drug utilization review committees, medications were prescribed appropriately in approximately 90% of cases. Of concern, 65% of patients given antipsychotics in New York and 67% in Ohio were not psychotic; the primary target symptom in such cases was aggression., , , CONCLUSIONS, Prescribing practices appeared to be appropriate, although the use of antipsychotic medications in nonpsychotic children is a concern for the field of child psychiatry.

Study Two hundred subjects were identified from a list of Cedars-Sinai Medical Foundation patients and gastroenterology motility practice subjects with and without a potential diagnosis of GERD. All subjects were then evaluated independently by two blinded physicians who were asked to identify subjects with GERD based on taking a history (gold standard). A follow-up questionnaire was later mailed to patients. This questionnaire included Rome I criteria for IBS. The prevalence of IBS was compared between GERD and non-GERD subjects. Finally, to further strengthen the method, a retrospective review of all subjects' charts was conducted to identify patients who had had 24-hour pH tests, and the prevalence of IBS was determined in this subgroup. Results Of the 200 subjects, 90 (45%) patients returned the questionnaire. After excluding subjects with IBD and incomplete questionnaires, there were 84 subjects (35 with GERD) included in the analysis. Of the 35 GERD subjects, 25 (71%) were Rome I criteria positive for IBS, whereas only 17 of the 49 (35%) non-GERD subjects had IBS (odds ratio = 54.7, CI = 1.7–13.5, p < 0.01). In 11 of the GERD subjects a 24-hour pH study was available and confirmed GERD. Of these 11 subjects, 7 (64%) met Rome I criteria for IBS.

Most of the research has focused on children with disruptive behavior disorders, autism, or mental retardation, but more recently other disorders such as depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, separation anxiety (school refusal), and Tourette syndrome are also receiving attention. Psychopharmacotherapy has often been a matter of controversy, with most issues pertaining to either the appropriateness of medication (e.g., rationales for treatment, alternative interventions, toxicity, iatrogenic effects) or inadequacies of clinical management (e.g., availability of services, drug assessment procedures, limitations of research). This article presents a brief overview of the safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs and the issues associated with their use in clinical settings.;Yes;Yes;1991;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5869c9e9b2f865506c6df3a010cf7256a2e42a94

While such stimulation was classically achieved with various motion devices, like Cox's chair or Hallaran's swing, the development of caloric and galvanic vestibular stimulation has opened up new possibilities in the 20th century. With the increasing knowledge and recognition of vestibular contributions to various perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional processes, vestibular stimulation has been suggested as a powerful and non-invasive treatment for a range of psychiatric, neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions. Yet, the therapeutic interventions were, and still are, often not hypothesis-driven as broader theories remain scarce and underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are often vague. We aim to critically review the literature on vestibular stimulation as a form of therapy in various selected disorders and present its successes, expectations, and drawbacks from a historical perspective.;Yes;Yes;2015;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dee0dc34fb21554be27fb10e28411463e0f1e54d

To survey the efficacy and safety of piracetam in pediatric opsoclonus–myoclonus, we conducted an open, randomized, two-period, dose-ranging, double-blind, crossover, clinical trial of five children comparing the antimyoclonic properties of oral piracetam to placebo. We devised and validated a new rating scale, specifically for pediatric opsoclonus–myoclonus. Two parents while blinded were able to identify the active phase by improvement in behavior, but another thought the behavior was worse. None of the patients showed improvement in myoclonus. The adult-equivalent dose of piracetam used in this study, which is threefold higher than that used in previous pediatric studies, was well tolerated and safe.

A battery of four tests was used: (1) distortion-product otoacoustic emissions, (2) the Repeated Evoked Potentials version of the Auditory Brainstem Response, (3) quantitative electroencephalography measured over the left and right sides of the auditory cortex, and (4) a hand-eye coordination task. The battery required approximately 1.5 hr. to complete. Each subject was tested with the battery in each of eight longitudinal sessions: three times on a control day (9 am, 1 pm, 3 pm—no medication); the same times on a second day one week later (medication at approximately 11:30 am), and 24- and 48-hr. check-up sessions following the medication day. Analysis indicated changes in all components, with details suggesting the site(s) of action of this type of antihistamine. The cross-section of the auditory system yielded by this battery makes it possible to observe effects at the periphery, in the brainstem, and in the cortex, including evidence linking otoacoustic emissions with central auditory physiology. Implications range from cautions regarding the use of antihistamines to physiological support for employing such medications to enhance patients' response to vestibular rehabilitation as well as to improve performance in learning-disordered children.;No;Yes;1999;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f000674e4e95371ec14b7d313a3b9a30676160a

METHODS Twenty patients (12 men, eight women), aged 17–43 years, with classical Unverricht-Lundborg disease were enrolled in a multicentre, randomised, double blind trial of crossover design in which the effects of daily doses of 9.6 g, 16.8 g, and 24 g piracetam, given in two divided doses, were compared with placebo. The crossover design was such that patients received placebo and two of the three dosage regimens of piracetam, each for two weeks, for a total treatment period of six weeks and thus without wash out between each treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was a sum score representing the adjusted total of the ratings of six components of a myoclonus rating scale in which stimulus sensitivity, motor impairment, functional disability, handwriting, and global assessments by investigators and patients were scored. Sequential clinical assessments were made by the same neurologist in the same environment at the same time of day. RESULTS Treatment with 24 g/day piracetam produced significant and clinically relevant improvement in the primary outcome measure of mean sum score (p=0.005) and in the means of its subtests of motor impairment (p=0.02), functional disability (p=0.003), and in global assessments by both investigator (p=0.002) and patient (p=0.01). Significant improvement in functional disability was also found with daily doses of 9.6 g and 16.8 g. The dose-effect relation was linear and significant. More patients showed clinically relevant improvement with the highest dosage and, in individual patients, increasing the dose improved response. Piracetam was well tolerated and adverse effects were few, mild, and transient. CONCLUSIONS This study provides further evidence that piracetam is an effective and safe medication in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease. In addition, it shows that a dose of 24 g is highly beneficial, more effective than lower doses and that a dose-effect relation exists. There is considerable variation in optimal individual dosage.;No;Yes;1998;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b436474c48af6213b8406ebe8e8a953173ce19e

Cognitive deficits have been reported in almost 50% of patients with a relapsing-remitting course and in a significantly higher percentage of patients with a chronic progressive course leading to intellectual disability which is often severe enough to preclude employment. MS is considered a form of subcortical dementia and the occurrence of classical cortical disorders such as aphasia, agnosia and apraxia is reported to be rare in the disease. However, in my experience alexia, a reading impairment unrelated to visual acuity or visual field defects, is common in patients with MS. Recently, I reported that treatment with picotesla range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) is an efficacious modality in the management of both the motor and cognitive symptoms of MS. Three patients with MS who developed alexia as a manifestation of the disease are presented. In all patients the alexia was reversed several months after they began treatment with EMFs. Since alexia usually reflects a disconnection syndrome whereby lesions involving the left visual cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum disconnect language association areas from visual association areas, it is suggested that reversal of the alexia in these patients by EMFs was related to improved interhemispheric transcallosal transmission of visual information. In addition, it is conceivable that changes in the metabolism of monoamines, which are involved in visual information processing and reading comprehension, may have been important in causing reversal of the alexia. This report further supports the unique efficacy of this treatment modality in reversing specific cognitive deficits in MS.;No;Yes;1995;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2727c036ab4ef5becda724c63f535c314f5761a8

Results from in vitro experiments, animal models and analysis of human samples from randomized controlled trials provide comprehensive data illustrating the pleiotropic actions of Vitamin D on the immune system. They globally result in immunomodulation by decreasing differentiation of effector T and B cells while promoting regulatory subsets. Vitamin D also modulates innate immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells, and acts at the level of the blood–brain barrier reducing immune cell trafficking. Vitamin D exerts additional activity within the central nervous system reducing microglial and astrocytic activation. The immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D detected in animal models of multiple sclerosis has suggested its potential therapeutic use for treating multiple sclerosis. In this review, we focus on recent published data describing the biological effects of Vitamin D in animal models of multiple sclerosis on immune cells, blood–brain barrier function, activation of glial cells and its potential neuroprotective effects. Based on the current knowledge, we also discuss optimization of therapeutic interventions with Vitamin D in patients with multiple sclerosis, as well as new technologies allowing in-depth analysis of immune cell regulations by vitamin D.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d37defddfafe756a6f1c0a7a206bdf9c943b21e7

However, it also exerts a broad range of extra-skeletal effects on cellular physiology and on the immune system. Vitamins D2 and D3 share a high degree of structural similarity. Functional equivalence in their vitamin D-dependent effects on human physiology is usually assumed but has in fact not been well defined experimentally. In this study we seek to redress the gap in knowledge by undertaking an in-depth examination of changes in the human blood transcriptome following supplementation with physiological doses of vitamin D2 and D3. Our work extends a previously published randomized placebo-controlled trial that recruited healthy white European and South Asian women who were given 15 µg of vitamin D2 or D3 daily over 12 weeks in wintertime in the UK (Nov-Mar) by additionally determining changes in the blood transcriptome over the intervention period using microarrays. An integrated comparison of the results defines both the effect of vitamin D3 or D2 on gene expression, and any influence of ethnic background. An important aspect of this analysis was the focus on the changes in expression from baseline to the 12-week endpoint of treatment within each individual, harnessing the longitudinal design of the study. Whilst overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes was present in the D2 or D3-dependent effects identified, most changes were specific to either one vitamin or the other. The data also pointed to the possibility of ethnic differences in the responses. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding pathways of the innate and adaptive immune systems, potentially shifting the immune system to a more tolerogenic status. Surprisingly, gene expression associated with type I and type II interferon activity, critical to the innate response to bacterial and viral infections, differed following supplementation with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3, with only vitamin D3 having a stimulatory effect. This study suggests that further investigation of the respective physiological roles of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 is warranted.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5579989f620cf06d83dab1c412b23342697a85c8

In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, participants were given daily physiological doses (15 g) of either vitamin D2 or D3 for 12 weeks and changes in the transcriptome were compared relative to the transcriptome at baseline. While there was some overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes after supplementation with each vitamin D source, most changes were specific to either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2, suggesting that each form of the vitamin may have different effects on human physiology. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These are consistent with the emerging concept that vitamin D orchestrates a shift in the immune system towards a more tolerogenic status. The profound differences in gene expression after supplementation with vitamin D2 compared with vitamin D3 warrant a more intensive investigation of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b66dbe138324cbd5d18717a942a8d2e3aa47337

Majority still hit thing least over less.;DemoPaper;Rapid and effective neural transmission of information requires correct axonal myelination. Modifications in myelination alter axonal capacity to transmit electric impulses and enable pathological conditions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons, a complex process involving various cellular interactions. However, we know little about the mechanisms that orchestrate correct myelination. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Using female and male mutant mice to delete these proteins, we found that activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways was weaker in mice lacking one or both of these GTPases, suggesting that both proteins coordinate the activity of these two pathways. Loss of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 diminishes the number of OLs in major myelinated CNS tracts and increases the proportion of immature OLs. In R-Ras1−/− and R-Ras2−/−-null mice, OLs show aberrant morphologies and fail to differentiate correctly into myelin-forming phenotypes. The smaller OL population and abnormal OL maturation induce severe hypomyelination, with shorter nodes of Ranvier in R-Ras1−/− and/or R-Ras2−/− mice. These defects explain the slower conduction velocity of myelinated axons that we observed in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Together, these results suggest that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are upstream elements that regulate the survival and differentiation of progenitors into OLs through the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways for proper myelination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this study, we show that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 play essential roles in regulating myelination in vivo and control fundamental aspects of oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and differentiation through synergistic activation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK signaling. Mice lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 show a diminished OL population with a higher proportion of immature OLs, explaining the observed hypomyelination in main CNS tracts. In vivo electrophysiology recordings demonstrate a slower conduction velocity of nerve impulses in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Therefore, R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for proper axonal myelination and accurate neural transmission.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e945d6513053863f2371d402efde295caa2935a2

The only efficient treatment to date is anticoagulant therapy and thrombectomy, which enable restitution of blood flow to ischemic tissues. Numerous promising neuroprotectants have failed in clinical trials. Given the complex pathomechanism of stroke, a multitarget pharmacotherapy seems a more rational approach in stroke prevention and treatment than drugs acting on single molecular targets. Recently, vitamin D3 has emerged as a potential treatment adjunct for ischemic stroke, as it interferes with the key prosurvival pathways and shows neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, regenerative and anti-aging properties in both neuronal and vascular tissue. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of vitamin D3 on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and neuroplasticity may play a role not only in the recovery of neurological functions, but also in ameliorating post-stroke depression and anxiety. This narrative review presents advances in research on the biochemical mechanisms of stroke-related brain damage, and the genomic and non-genomic effects of vitamin D3 which may interfere with diverse cell death signaling pathways. Next, we discuss the results of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on the neuroprotective potential of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in brain ischemia models.

Beat social speech glass certain those., True trade oil blood event.;Poster;Abstract The role of steroid hormones against infectious diseases has been extensively studied. From immunomodulatory action to direct inhibition of microorganism growth, hormones D3 (VD3) and 17β-estradiol (E2), and the genetic pathways modulated by them, are key targets for a better understanding pathogenesis of infectious respiratory diseases (IRD) such as tuberculosis (TB) and the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Currently, the world faces two major public health problems, the outbreak of COVID-19, accounting for more than 6 million so far, and TB, more than 1 million deaths per year. Both, although resulting from different pathogens, the Mtb and the SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are considered serious and epidemic. TB and COVID-19 present similar infection rates between men and women, however the number of complications and deaths resulting from the two infections is higher in men when compared to women in childbearing age, which may indicate a role of the sex hormone E2 in the context of these diseases. E2 and VD3 act upon key gene pathways as important immunomodulatory players and supporting molecules in IRDs. This review summarizes the main roles of these hormones (VD3 and E2) in modulating immune and inflammatory responses and their relationship with TB and COVID-19.;No;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0713a3d36da02e45a6011a41236fc1a3fc385ec

Companies are releasing new specifics at an alarming pace, while dietary supplements are one of the less-studied substances released for public consumption. However, access to state-of-the-art and high-throughput techniques, such as the ones used in omics, make it possible to check the impact of a substance on human transcriptome or proteome and provide answers to whether its use is reasonable and beneficial. In this review, the main domains of omics are briefly introduced. The review focuses on the three most widely used omics techniques: NGS, LC-MS, NMR, and their usefulness in studying dietary supplements. Examples of studies are described for some of the most commonly supplemented substances, such as vitamins: D, E, A, and plant extracts: resveratrol, green tea, ginseng, and curcumin extract. Techniques used in omics have proven to be useful in studying dietary supplements. NGS techniques are helpful in identifying pathways that change upon supplementation and determining polymorphisms or conditions that qualify for the necessity of a given supplementation. LC-MS techniques are used to establish the serum content of supplemented a compound and its effects on metabolites. Both LC-MS and NMR help establish the actual composition of a compound, its primary and secondary metabolites, and its potential toxicity. Moreover, NMR techniques determine what conditions affect the effectiveness of supplementation.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52d7d053c5c278527e371e1fa5bd6841d141bc6f

Team world subject poor worker interest.;Statement account per., Someone human movie staff Mr year itself. Product by from half make field image. Nor night road very people.;Poster;Abstract Vitamin D is both a nutrient and a neurologic hormone that plays a critical role in modulating immune responses. While low levels of vitamin D are associated with increased susceptibility to infections and immune-related disorders, vitamin D supplementation has demonstrated immunomodulatory effects that can be protective against various diseases and infections. Vitamin D receptor is expressed in immune cells that have the ability to synthesise the active vitamin D metabolite. Thus, vitamin D acts in an autocrine manner in a local immunologic milieu in fighting against infections. Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are the new disciplines of nutritional science that explore the interaction between nutrients and genes using distinct approaches to decipher the mechanisms by which nutrients can influence disease development. Though molecular and observational studies have proved the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D, only very few studies have documented the molecular insights of vitamin D supplementation. Until recently, researchers have investigated only a few selected genes involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway that may influence the response to vitamin D supplementation and possibly disease risk. This review summarises the impact of vitamin D supplementation on immune markers from nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics perspective based on evidence collected through a structured search using PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct and Web of Science. The research gaps and shortcomings from the existing data and future research direction of vitamin D supplementation on various immune-related disorders are discussed.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47b0919c5984328a33453cfc5096094794311144

A high prevalence of low vitamin D status has been reported across the world in a wide range of population groups, and this includes communities living in low latitude areas despite the abundance of sunlight. It is accepted that vitamin D status is reflected by the level of the circulating metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), which is produced by hepatic hydroxylation of vitamin D, derived either from the skin from UV exposure or the gut from oral intake. Vitamin D has been associated with a wide range of health outcomes, but controversies remain as to their exact nature and extent and whether associations are in the causal pathway. In order to enable wider discussions on this nutrient, a 'Hot Topic' Vitamin D Workshop achieved funding from the UK Nutrition Research Partnership Medical Research Council call. The objectives of the workshop were (1) to elucidate the role of vitamin D in human health and (2) develop strategies to improve vitamin D status in the UK population.

The World Health Organization recommends social isolation as a way of minimizing the risk of contagion of the disease. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of older adults and to investigate how anthropometric, functional, and clinical aspects are associated with this process. Methods: Fifty healthy older adults were followed-up during 5 months. The subjects had their physical and mental health assessed during social isolation (pre-vaccine situation) and after the opening of stores and activities in the municipality (post-vaccine situation). Physical evaluation was performed using the 30-s sit and stand test. Participants’ mental health was assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Loneliness Index. In this methodological design, muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and loneliness index were subject to pre-post analyses. In addition, these variables were included as outcomes in linear regression models. Participants’ anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors were included as predictors of the statistical model. Results: Participants’ scores at baseline were consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscle strength of the subjects was appropriate to their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined, but with statistical significance only for depressive symptoms (p = 0.017, effect size of 0.11). Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained 42.8% of depressive symptoms, 22.3% of loneliness, and 30.2% of muscle strength in the elderly. Discussion/Conclusion: Older adults presented baseline scores consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscular strength of the subjects was appropriate for their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined. Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained a substantial part of the depressive symptoms, loneliness, and muscular strength in the elderly. Health care professionals should be aware of performing a wide assessment in subjects’ lives to ensure better health status.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2038006184f32b3e95496c695742268d55e7b9b

Since vaccines must be thoroughly tested, viral respiratory tract infections (VRTIs), mainly coronaviruses, have seriously affected human health worldwide in recent years. In this review, we presented the relevant data which originated from trusted publishers regarding the practical benefits of functional foods (FFs) and their dietary sources, in addition to natural plant products, in viral respiratory and COVID-19 prevention and immune-boosting activities. As a result, FFs were confirmed to be functionally active ingredients for preventing COVID-19 and VRTIs. Furthermore, the antiviral activity and immunological effects of FFs against VRTIs and COVID-19 and their potential main mechanisms of action are also being reviewed. Therefore, to prevent COVID-19 and VRTIs, it is critical to identify controlling the activities and immune-enhancing functional food constituents as early as possible. We further aimed to summarize functional food constituents as a dietary supplement that aids in immune system boosting and may effectively reduce VRTIs and COVID-19 and promote therapeutic efficacy.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d84e751b0e9d75de8a91a71daf3328c71140606f

The optimal status of vitamins and microelements is considered crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system and necessary for successful recovery. Most patients with respiratory distress in COVID-19 are vitamin and microelement deficient, with vitamin D and Se deficiency being the most common. Anyway, various micronutrient supplements are widely and arbitrarily used for prevention or in the treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to summarise current knowledge about molecular and physiological mechanisms of vitamins (D, A, C, B6, B9 and B12) and microelements (Se, Zn, Cu and Fe) involved in the immune system regulation in consideration with COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as recent findings related to their usage and effects in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In the early course of the pandemic, several, mainly observational, studies reported an association of some micronutrients, such as vitamin C, D and Zn, with severity reduction and survival improvement. Still, emerging randomised controlled trials showed no effect of vitamin D on hospitalisation length and no effect of vitamin C and Zn on symptom reduction. Up to date, there is evidence neither for nor against the use of micronutrients in the treatment of COVID-19. The doses that exceed the recommended for the general population and age group should not be used, except in clinical trials. Benefits of supplementation are primarily expected in populations prone to micronutrient deficiencies, who are, as well, at a higher risk of worse outcomes in COVID-19.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87009424f8ceb7085319a5d8e7dd5339788d96d7

The virus then spread to Europe and across all continents where it has led to higher mortality and morbidity, and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Recently, different vaccines have been produced and seem to be more or less effective in protecting from COVID-19. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS), an essential enzymatic cascade involved in maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance, is involved in the pathogenicity of COVID-19, since the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) acts as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in many human tissues and organs. In fact, the viral entrance promotes a downregulation of ACE2 followed by RAS balance dysregulation and an overactivation of the angiotensin II (Ang II)–angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) axis, which is characterized by a strong vasoconstriction and the induction of the profibrotic, proapoptotic and proinflammatory signalizations in the lungs and other organs. This mechanism features a massive cytokine storm, hypercoagulation, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent multiple organ damage. While all individuals are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the disease outcome and severity differ among people and countries and depend on a dual interaction between the virus and the affected host. Many studies have already pointed out the importance of host genetic polymorphisms (especially in the RAS) as well as other related factors such age, gender, lifestyle and habits and underlying pathologies or comorbidities (diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) that could render individuals at higher risk of infection and pathogenicity. In this review, we explore the correlation between all these risk factors as well as how and why they could account for severe post-COVID-19 complications.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/adc18d46f28a8618d579bb44828bc7cb15e3462e

Here, we systematically explored the transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) for therapeutic targeting using approved drugs. We integrated a resource of TF-cytokine gene interactions with single-cell RNA-seq expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells of COVID-19 patients. We found 581 significantly correlated interactions, between 95 TFs and 16 cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients, that may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drugs combinations on inflammatory cytokine production, which revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production. Further studies of these candidate repurposable drugs could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74b290f314b5590c34c271ee1090fa2701237630

New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to deaths as well as social and economic disruptions, is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Hence, only supportive care has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for now. Pharmacological agents used for the adjunctive treatment of COVID-19 following the current literature and clinical experiences include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malaria drugs, and other traditional or untraditional treatments. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs may have some negative effects and comorbidities. Moreover, the current data have indicated that the risk of drug-drug interactions may also be high in polypharmacy cases, especially in elderly people, some comorbidity situations, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is highly possible that these situations can not only increase the risk of drug-drug interactions but also increase the risk of food/nutrition-drug interactions and affect the nutritional status. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature. In this review, current information on the possible mechanisms as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of some pharmacological agents used in the treatment of COVID-19 and/or their secondary interactions with nutrition were evaluated and some future directions were given.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c61266aee66e54df5f4f5c61444589c7d911b73a

Evening senior phone television market because.;FullPaper;The report from Amin et al concluded that the use of vitamin D supplementation for reduction of COVID-19 risks was not supported by the available data using Mendelian randomisation analysis (MRA) of UK Biobank data for Britons of European origin. Their study used Genomewide association [GWA] methodology to determine gene variant effects on baseline serum 25hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, which were then used as surrogates for longterm vitamin D status in their MRA, without data for vitamin D intakes or sunshine exposure. Though MRA studies using gene variant effects on serum 25(OH)D are common, the potential for error due to the nonlinear associations of biological and health effects with serum 25(OH) D concentrations (vitamin D status) is widely recognised. However, no satisfactory way has evolved for avoiding the confounding necessarily introduced by inclusion of the data lying on the upper or lower plateaus of those Sshaped relationships, but those were the datasets selected for analysis in this study. This matter is important since changes in the efficacy of vitamin D are not seen in subjects with 25(OH)D values along the lower or upper plateaus of the Sshaped association curves. And, in deficiency, no health benefits are seen with supplementation in subjects on the lower plateau unless their 25(OH)D concentrations are raised onto the steep part of the association curves, from ≤25 nmol/L (=UK deficiency) to at least 50 nmol/L for bone health but to higher values for effects with higher thresholds (eg, to 80–100 nmol/L for reducing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risks, respectively). Since gene variant effects on 25(OH)D values were reported as being much smaller than the 25–50–75 nmol/L (100%– 200%–300%) increases in 25(OH) D values such thresholds require, it is unlikely that MRAs of population data can detect health effects of variation in serum 25(OH)D in subjects with 25(OH)D values <25 nmol/L unless the 25(OH)D thresholds required to affect the outcome of interest are extremely low, especially in datasets selected for baseline vitamin D deficiency. In view of these analytical difficulties, it might be that avoiding data from the known associational plateaus for health effects of interest (ie, selecting datasets for subjects with baseline 25(OH)D values between 25 nmol/L and 110 nmol/L, even though those values only predict ~16% of current status) 7 might be helpful in examining longterm differences in vitamin D status as a potential determinant of health effects such as COVID-19 risks. Those ‘cutoffs’ for COVID-19 risks are suggested by the data analyses reported by Kaufman and colleagues for reductions in COVID-19 infection rates with increases in vitamin D status as assessed by 25(OH)D measurements made during the year before the pandemic began, using data available from a large representational American cohort study. There are many mechanistic reasons for suggesting that better vitamin D status should be protective against COVID-19 risks. Furthermore, a recent study of UK Biobank data suggests that those taking vitamin D supplements over time before the pandemic began had reduced COVID-19 risks in the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Might the authors, therefore, consider whether the modified approach to MRA for COVID-19 with genomewide association studies (GWAS) predicted variations in vitamin D status could prove useful?

This has prompted researchers to seek specific novel and definitive treatments urgently. In this context, it is interesting to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of existing pharmacological agents that could be useful. In this regard, vitamin D supplementation, particularly in individuals likely to be deficient, may be a promising option. Vitamin D is a hormone that modulates many of the same inflammatory and oxidative signaling pathways triggered during COVID-19. For example, vitamin D suppresses the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, which has a determining role in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response related to COVID-19. This paper analyzes the evidence that vitamin D supplementation might be a valuable preventive/therapeutic measure in groups at risk for or infected with COVID-19. It also discusses how clinical studies could be best designed to evaluate the possible advantages of vitamin D supplementation for the benefit of public health during the pandemic.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/799f8d39def90e89f2f4a5f105a2ac7d2a2462f9

Hour cultural study through policy.;Poster;As the world's attention has been riveted upon the growing COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have written brief reports supporting the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19. The clear common thread among the top risk groups—vitamin D deficiency—may be being overlooked because of previous overstated claims of vitamin D benefits. However, the need to decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations is urgent. Early researchers reported three striking patterns. Firstly, the innate immune system is impaired by vitamin D deficiency, which would predispose sufferers to viral infections such as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the activity of the X-chromosome-linked “Renin-Angiotensin” System, making vitamin D deficient individuals (especially men) more susceptible to COVID-19's deadly “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system overreaction). Secondly, the groups who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 match those who are at highest risk for severe vitamin D deficiency. This includes the elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin is naturally rich in melanin (if living outside the tropics), those who avoid sun exposure for cultural and health reasons, those who live in institutions, the obese, and/or those who suffer with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. And thirdly, the pattern of geographical spread of COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin D deficiency. Both within the USA and throughout the world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin D deficiency rates. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and RSMLDS, with targeted Google searches providing additional sources. Although randomized controlled trial results may be available eventually, the correlational and causal study evidence supporting a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risks is already so strong that it supports action. The 141 author groups writing primarily about biological plausibility detailed how vitamin D deficiency can explain every risk factor and every complication of COVID-19, but agreed that other factors are undoubtedly at work. COVID-19 was compared with dengue fever, for which oral vitamin D supplements of 4,000 IU for 10 days were significantly more effective than 1,000 IU in reducing virus replication and controlling the “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible for fatalities. Among the 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found that serum vitamin D levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) and linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies). Two causal modeling studies and several analyses of variance strongly supported the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a causal, rather than a bystander, factor in COVID-19 outcomes. Three of the four studies whose findings opposed the hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions. The literature review also found that prophylactically correcting possible vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely safe. Widely recommending 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for all populations with limited ability to manufacture vitamin D from the sun has virtually no potential for harm and is reasonably likely to save many lives.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcd0328a0229d92828d62ff0be90de581e68b063

According to the latest literature, most patients with COVID‐19 have mild symptoms that do not require hospital admissions, and only a small percentage of those hospitalized require intensive care. In the intensive care unit (ICU), a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) assists the critical care team by formulating, executing, and monitoring the nutrition strategies and interventions to meet the unique requirements of extremely sick patients. However, because of the novelty of COVID‐19, the situation is fluid and guidelines continue to be developed and updated. This article discusses the interim guidelines available for the nutrition support of ICU COVID‐19 patients and the challenges the critical care team and RDN may face from a nutrition standpoint.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fbd8ba9aa168ba11eb93a7a2ab50a93ad0b229a

Active hydroxyl forms of vitamin D are anti‐inflammatory, induce antioxidative responses, and stimulate innate immunity against infectious agents. These properties are shared by calcitriol and the CYP11A1‐generated non‐calcemic hydroxyderivatives. They inhibit the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, downregulate NF‐κΒ, show inverse agonism on RORγ and counteract oxidative stress through the activation of NRF‐2. Therefore, a direct delivery of hydroxyderivatives of vitamin D deserves consideration in the treatment of COVID‐19 or ARDS of different aetiology. We also recommend treatment of COVID‐19 patients with high‐dose vitamin D since populations most vulnerable to this disease are likely vitamin D deficient and patients are already under supervision in the clinics. We hypothesize that different routes of delivery (oral and parenteral) will have different impact on the final outcome.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f441c5ae359b02765588759f48919f25fd74bf2

Vitamins D2/D3 were discovered exactly a hundred years ago, and over the last 50 years vitamin D has been found to have many effects on virtually all human tissues and not just on bone health, while mechanisms affecting the actions of vitamin D at the cellular level are increasingly understood, but deficiency persists globally. Observational studies in humans have shown that better provision of vitamin D is strongly associated, dose-wise, with reductions in current and future health risks in line with the known actions of vitamin D. Randomised controlled trials, commonly accepted as providing a ‘gold standard’ for assessing the efficacy of new forms of treatment, have frequently failed to provide supportive evidence for the expected health benefits of supplementation. Such RCTs, however, have used designs evolved for testing drugs while vitamin D is a nutrient; the appreciation of this difference is critical to identifying health benefits from existing RCT data and for improving future RCT design. This report aims, therefore, to provide a brief overview of the evidence for a range of non-bony health benefits of vitamin D repletion; to discuss specific aspects of vitamin D biology that can confound RCT design and how to allow for them.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73f3955e4f65729a5fcee70f95d85cb4c8aac524

None leader father Mr administration.;FullPaper;Cognitive decline is one of the greatest health threats of old age and the maintenance of optimal brain function across a lifespan remains a big challenge. The hippocampus is considered particularly vulnerable but there is cross-species consensus that its functional integrity benefits from the early and continuous exercise of demanding physical, social and mental activities, also referred to as environmental enrichment (EE). Here, we investigated the extent to which late-onset EE can improve the already-impaired cognitive abilities of lifelong deprived C57BL/6 mice and how it affects gene expression in the hippocampus. To this end, 5- and 24-month-old mice housed in standard cages (5mSC and 24mSC) and 24-month-old mice exposed to EE in the last 2 months of their life (24mEE) were subjected to a Barnes maze task followed by next-generation RNA sequencing of the hippocampal tissue. Our analyses showed that late-onset EE was able to restore deficits in spatial learning and short-term memory in 24-month-old mice. These positive cognitive effects were reflected by specific changes in the hippocampal transcriptome, where late-onset EE affected transcription much more than age (24mSC vs. 24mEE: 1311 DEGs, 24mSC vs. 5mSC: 860 DEGs). Remarkably, a small intersection of 72 age-related DEGs was counter-regulated by late-onset EE. Of these, Bcl3, Cttnbp2, Diexf, Esr2, Grb10, Il4ra, Inhba, Rras2, Rps6ka1 and Socs3 appear to be particularly relevant as key regulators involved in dendritic spine plasticity and in age-relevant molecular signaling cascades mediating senescence, insulin resistance, apoptosis and tissue regeneration. In summary, our observations suggest that the brains of aged mice in standard cage housing preserve a considerable degree of plasticity. Switching them to EE proved to be a promising and non-pharmacological intervention against cognitive decline.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/901fc3ace1f3763c1e547bf16c2d9c1198768956

We found that MO3.13 cells changed their morphology when treated with both agents. Interestingly, CX-5461, but not PMA, induced noticeable changes in the integrity of the nucleoli. Then, we analyzed the p53 transcriptional activity in MO3.13 cells and found that it was increased in both cell populations, but particularly in cells treated with PMA. Interestingly, this high p53 transcriptional activity in PMA-treated cells coincided with a lower level of an unmodified (non-phosphorylated) form of this protein. Since morphological changes in MO3.13 cells after PMA and CX-5461 treatment were evident, suggesting that cells were induced to differentiate, we performed RNA-seq analysis of PMA-treated cells, to reveal the direction of alterations in gene expression. The analysis showed that the largest group of upregulated genes consisted of those involved in myogenesis and K-RAS signaling, rather than those associated with oligodendrocyte lineage progression.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60c067b8c51665f653a7005e356b1eeafb44ba4f

OLs are generated throughout life from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) via a series of tightly controlled differentiation steps. Life-long myelination is essential for learning and to replace myelin lost in age-related pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as white matter pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, there is considerable myelin loss in the aging brain, which is accelerated in AD and underpins the failure of remyelination in secondary progressive MS. An important factor in age-related myelin loss is a marked decrease in the regenerative capacity of OPCs. In this review, we will contextualize recent advances in the key role of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling in regulating multiple biological pathways in oligodendroglia that are dysregulated in aging.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3aa4a4a303bb15729fb6ed3011eaf76b829a71c4

In this sense, our laboratory has recently reported that the GTPases R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for oligodendrocyte survival and maturation. Hypomyelination produced by the absence of one or both proteins triggers axonal degeneration and loss of visual and motor function. However, little is known about R-Ras specificity and other possible roles that they could play in the CNS. In this work, we describe how a lack of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 could not be compensated by increased expression of the closely related R-Ras3 or classical Ras. We further studied R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 expression within different CNS anatomical regions, finding that both were more abundant in less-myelinated regions, suggesting their expression in non-oligodendroglial cells. Finally, using confocal immunostaining colocalization, we report for the first time that R-Ras2 is specifically expressed in neurons. Neither microglia nor astrocytes expressed R-Ras1 or R-Ras2. These results open a new avenue for the study of neuronal R-Ras2’s contribution to the process of myelination.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50eeabbdf2ee62f84a7d455afff01d762a692d1a

Catch appear position fact Congress., Along ever across month.;FullPaper;Fast synaptic transmission in vertebrates is critically dependent on myelin for insulation and metabolic support. Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes (OLs) that maintain multilayered membrane compartments that wrap around axonal fibers. Alterations in myelination can therefore lead to severe pathologies such as multiple sclerosis. Given that hypomyelination disorders have complex etiologies, reproducing clinical symptoms of myelin diseases from a neurological perspective in animal models has been difficult. We recently reported that R‐Ras1−/− and/or R‐Ras2−/− mice, which lack GTPases essential for OL survival and differentiation processes, present different degrees of hypomyelination in the central nervous system with a compounded hypomyelination in double knockout (DKO) mice. Here, we discovered that the loss of R‐Ras1 and/or R‐Ras2 function is associated with aberrant myelinated axons with increased numbers of mitochondria, and a disrupted mitochondrial respiration that leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels. Consequently, aberrant myelinated axons are thinner with cytoskeletal phosphorylation patterns typical of axonal degeneration processes, characteristic of myelin diseases. Although we observed different levels of hypomyelination in a single mutant mouse, the combined loss of function in DKO mice lead to a compromised axonal integrity, triggering the loss of visual function. Our findings demonstrate that the loss of R‐Ras function reproduces several characteristics of hypomyelinating diseases, and we therefore propose that R‐Ras1−/− and R‐Ras2−/− neurological models are valuable approaches for the study of these myelin pathologies.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/525b4a0c7afd350e806912775fc276580cdc1db9

In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes are responsible for creating myelin sheaths that isolate and protect axons, even throughout adulthood. However, when myelin is lost, the failure of remyelination mechanisms can cause neurodegenerative myelin-associated pathologies. From oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, myelination is a highly complex process that involves many elements of cellular signaling, yet many of the mechanisms that coordinate it, remain unknown. In this review, we will focus on the three major pathways involved in myelination (PI3K/Akt/mTOR, ERK1/2-MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin) and recent advances describing the crosstalk elements which help to regulate them. In addition, we will review the tight relation between Ras GTPases and myelination processes and discuss its potential as novel elements of crosstalk between the pathways. A better understanding of the crosstalk elements orchestrating myelination mechanisms is essential to identify new potential targets to mitigate neurodegeneration.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3a6f7c644890bccbecc1d442d7b2d27c8d3f216

Say economy exactly agree fill money.;FullPaper;Purpose Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive central nervous system (CNS) cancer and a serious threat to human health. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HULC has been implicated in GBM, but the molecular mechanism is uncertain. This study used quantitative proteomic analysis for global identification of HULC-regulated proteins in glioblastoma cells and identification of potential biomarkers. Materials and Methods qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of HULC in U87 cells stably transfected with HULC or an empty vector (control). The CCK-8 assay, transwell assay, and wound-scratch assay were used to measure cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Quantitative proteomics using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Screened proteins were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and Western blotting. Results Overexpression of HULC led to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. HULC overexpression also led to significant upregulation of 37 proteins and downregulation of 78 proteins. Bioinformatics analysis indicated these proteins had roles in cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. PRM results of 8 of these proteins (PTK2, TNC, ITGAV, LASP1, MAPK14, ITGA1, GNA13, RRAS) were consistent with the LC-MS/MS and Western blotting results. Conclusion The results of present study suggest that lncRNA HULC promotes GBM cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by regulating RRAS expression, suggesting that RRAS may be a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for this cancer.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/895e65538dbba48e84113d173bb8035451d75b2b

Field most upon sort.;Poster;Optic nerve atrophy represents the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathies leading to vision impairment. The recently described Bosch‐Boonstra‐Schaaf optic atrophy (BBSOA) syndrome denotes an autosomal dominant genetic form of neuropathy caused by mutations or deletions in the NR2F1 gene. Herein, we describe a mouse model recapitulating key features of BBSOA patients—optic nerve atrophy, optic disc anomalies, and visual deficits—thus representing the only available mouse model for this syndrome. Notably, Nr2f1‐deficient optic nerves develop an imbalance between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes leading to postnatal hypomyelination and astrogliosis. Adult heterozygous mice display a slower optic axonal conduction velocity from the retina to high‐order visual centers together with associative visual learning deficits. Importantly, some of these clinical features, such the optic nerve hypomyelination, could be rescued by chemical drug treatment in early postnatal life. Overall, our data shed new insights into the cellular mechanisms of optic nerve atrophy in BBSOA patients and open a promising avenue for future therapeutic approaches.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e59776fedf3b5f980a47f10fd41b18564e137f9

Pm charge either city guy new address.;FullPaper;Background It is currently unknown whether the dynamic nature of depression affects the development of sarcopenia. Herein, this study aims to assess the association between possible new sarcopenia and the depression trajectory of individuals and their intimate partners through a 4-year longitudinal cohort study. Methods Our study included 784 pairs of individuals without possible sarcopenia and their spouses from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011. All individuals and their spouses received three assessments of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-item (CESD-10) scale in 2011, 2013, and 2015. According to the diagnostic algorithm recommended by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019, we evaluated the incidence of possible sarcopenia in individuals in 2015. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify a longitudinal depression trajectory of individuals and their spouses during a 4-year follow-up. Subsequently, we assessed the relationship between possible sarcopenia and depression trajectory using three generalized additive models. Results In 2015, 24.87% (195/784) of individuals were diagnosed with possible sarcopenia. LCA identified five depression trajectories: a persistently high risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (reference; class 1 = 34 [4.3%]); a persistently low risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (class 2 = 526 [67.1%]); a high risk of depression in individuals and a low risk of depression in spouses (class 3 = 46 [5.9%]); a low risk of depression in individuals and a high risk of depression in spouses (class 4 = 116 [14.8%]); and a reduced risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (class 5 = 62 [7.9%]). The highest incidence of possible sarcopenia was shown in class 1, followed by classes 3 and 5. Classes 2 (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20–0.97) and 4 (adjusted RR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.17–0.96) had a significantly lower incidence of possible sarcopenia than class 1. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the incidence of possible sarcopenia in class 4 was obviously higher in women (38.89%) than in men (18.4%). Conclusions Our study indicates a persistently high risk of depression in individuals to develop possible sarcopenia. In addition, a persistently high risk of depression in intimate partners potentially increases the risk of possible new sarcopenia, especially in female individuals who are at low risk of depression.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65b7976d6952b3737d2268a41c16bbdeb15ca1ba

Despite the progress in the treatment of localized prostate cancer, there is still lack of effective therapies for the advanced forms of the disease. Most patients with advanced prostate cancer become resistant to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which remains the main therapeutic option in this setting, and progress to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Current therapies for prostate cancer preferentially target proliferating, partially differentiated, and AR-dependent cancer cells that constitute the bulk of the tumor mass. However, the subpopulation of tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating stem-like cancer cells is virtually resistant to the standard treatments causing tumor relapse at the primary or metastatic sites. Understanding the pathways controlling the establishment, expansion and maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation is an important step toward the development of more effective treatment for prostate cancer, which might enable ablation or exhaustion of CSCs and prevent treatment resistance and disease recurrence. In this review, we focus on the impact of transcriptional regulators on phenotypic reprogramming of prostate CSCs and provide examples supporting the possibility of inhibiting maintenance and expansion of the CSC pool in human prostate cancer along with the currently available methodological approaches. Transcription factors are key elements for instructing specific transcriptional programs and inducing CSC-associated phenotypic changes implicated in disease progression and treatment resistance. Recent studies have shown that interfering with these processes causes exhaustion of CSCs with loss of self-renewal and tumorigenic capability in prostate cancer models. Targeting key transcriptional regulators in prostate CSCs is a valid therapeutic strategy waiting to be tested in clinical trials.;Yes;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bc04a174a13db3fe0c2f320e8ab01bf12f5e6af

Mortality is highly related to metastasis and hormone resistance, but the molecular underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have studied the presence and role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the Epithelial–Mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa, using both in vitro and in vivo models, thereby providing evidence that the stemness–mesenchymal axis seems to be a critical process related to relapse, metastasis and resistance. These are complex and related processes that involve a cooperative action of different cancer cell subpopulations, in which CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells (MCCs) would be responsible for invading, colonizing pre-metastatic niches, initiating metastasis and an evading treatments response. Manipulating the stemness–EMT axis genes on the androgen receptor (AR) may shed some light on the effect of this axis on metastasis and castration resistance in PCa. It is suggested that the EMT gene SNAI2/Slug up regulates the stemness gene Sox2, and vice versa, inducing AR expression, promoting metastasis and castration resistance. This approach will provide new sight about the role of the stemness–mesenchymal axis in the metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa and their potential control, contributing to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic and castration-resistant PCa.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0077c17cef9560b035930645fece7c8370d38c0

Design Fully mixed sequential equal status design including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Setting Primary care practices within an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. Participants We conducted 170 observations of patient encounters across 15 primary care clinics, 48 semi-structured interviews with staff, and 10 semi-structured interviews with patients. We also sent out surveys to 2,541 eligible staff with 616 responses (24% response rate) and to 5,132 eligible patients with 577 responses (11% response rate). Results Inconsistency emerged as a major barrier to effective medication reconciliation. This inconsistency was present across a variety of factors such as the lack of standardized workflows for conducting medication reconciliation, a lack of knowledge about medication and the process of medication reconciliation, varying levels of importance ascribed to medication reconciliation, and inadequate integration of medication reconciliation into clinical workflows. Findings were generally consistent across all data collection methods. Conclusion We have identified several barriers which impact the process of medication reconciliation in primary care settings. Our key finding is that the process of medication reconciliation is plagued by inconsistencies which contribute to inaccurate medication lists. These inconsistencies can be broken down into several categories (standardization, knowledge, importance, and inadequate integration) which can be targets for future studies and interventions.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6263e5e8247287a18b7d2b7e298c872f477b76ee

The endometriosis fertility index was developed to predict the fertility outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for endometriosis. Finally, the American Association of Gynecological Laparoscopists classification is currently being developed, for which 30 endometriosis experts are analyzing and researching data by assigning scores to categories considered important; however, it has not yet been fully validated and published.

Ninety women were evaluated, of whom 57 were confirmed as having endometriosis. Lactoferrin was measured by ELISA, transferrin, ferritin and iron on a Cobas 8000 analyser. Lactoferrin and transferrin in peritoneal fluid were lower compared to plasma, in contrast to ferritin and iron. In plasma, lactoferrin showeds associations with iron and transferrin in endometriosis and with ferritin in the group without endometriosis. Lactoferrin in peritoneal fluid correlated with lactoferrin, iron and transferrin of plasma in patients without endometriosis. The ratio of lactoferrin concentration in peritoneal fluid to plasma differentiated stage I versus IV of endometriosis and was negatively correlated with the iron ratio in patients without endometriosis. The ferritin ratio differentiated women with and without endometriosis. The very high ferritin ratios, especially in advanced stages of endometriosis, suggest the protective involvement of this protein in peritoneal fluid and the loss of this role by lactoferrin.

In this context, the use of biologically derived vesicles has also acquired importance for cancer immunotherapy. Extracellular vesicles are thus proposed to transport molecules able to trigger an immune response and thus fight cancer cells. As a particular immunotherapeutic approach, a new technique also consists in the exploitation of extracellular vesicles as new cancer vaccines. The present review provides basic notions on cancer immunotherapy and describes several clinical trials in which therapeutic anticancer vaccines are tested. In particular, the potential of extracellular vesicles-based therapeutic vaccines in the treatment of cancer patients is highlighted, even with advanced stage-cancer. A focus on the clinical studies, already completed or still in progress, is offered and a systematic collection and reorganization of the present literature on this topic is proposed to the reader. Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural particles formed by the lipid bilayer and released from almost all cell types to the extracellular environment both under physiological conditions and in presence of a disease. EVs are involved in many biological processes including intercellular communication, acting as natural carriers in the transfer of various biomolecules such as DNA, various RNA types, proteins and different phospholipids. Thanks to their transfer and targeting abilities, they can be employed in drug and gene delivery and have been proposed for the treatment of different diseases, including cancer. Recently, the use of EVs as biological carriers has also been extended to cancer immunotherapy. This new technique of cancer treatment involves the use of EVs to transport molecules capable of triggering an immune response to damage cancer cells. Several studies have analyzed the possibility of using EVs in new cancer vaccines, which represent a particular form of immunotherapy. In the literature there are only few publications that systematically group and collectively discuss these studies. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to illustrate and give a partial reorganization to what has been produced in the literature so far. We provide basic notions on cancer immunotherapy and describe some clinical trials in which therapeutic cancer vaccines are tested. We thus focus attention on the potential of EV-based therapeutic vaccines in the treatment of cancer patients, overviewing the clinically relevant trials, completed or still in progress, which open up new perspectives in the fight against cancer.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22024d99202b723c97f1b8323c7cd8637de8106b

While cancer stem cells (CSCs) may play a vital role in oncogenesis and development of lung cancer, mechanisms underlying CSCs self‐renewal remain less clear. In the present study, we constructed a clinically relevant CSCs enrichment recognition model and evaluated the potential functions of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways in lung cancer via bioinformatic analysis, providing the basis for in depth mechanistic inquisition. Experimentally, we confirmed that PI3K/AKT pathway predominantly promotes proliferation through anti-apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, while MAPK/ERK pathway has an overwhelming superiority in regulating the proliferation in lung CSCs. Further, utilizing stemness score model, LLC-Symmetric Division (LLC-SD) cells and mouse orthotopic lung transplantation model, we elucidated an intricate cross-talk between the oncogenic pathway and the stem cell reprograming pathway that impact stem cell characteristics as well as cancer biology features of lung CSCs both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our findings uncovered a new insight that PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways as oncogenic signaling pathway and/or stem cell signaling pathway act distinctively and synergistically to regulate lung CSCs self-renewal.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9302948464800646b146c0b29b812d6771909340

Therefore, it is imperative to identify reliable, non-invasive biomarkers of the disease. The aim of this study was to analyse the concentrations of fibronectin and type IV collagen in peritoneal fluid and plasma to assess their role as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of endometriosis. Fibronectin and collagen IV protein levels were assessed by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) biosensors with the usage of monoclonal antibodies. All patients enrolled in the study were referred for laparoscopy for the diagnosis of infertility or chronic pelvic pain (n = 84). The study group included patients with endometriosis confirmed during surgery (n = 49). The concentration of fibronectin in the plasma (329.3 ± 98.5 mg/L) and peritoneal fluid (26.8 ± 11.1 μg/L) in women with endometriosis was significantly higher than in the control group (251.2 ± 84.0 mg/L, 7.0 ± 5.9 μg/L). Fibronectin levels were independent of endometriosis stage (p = 0.874, p = 0.469). No significant differences were observed in collagen IV levels (p = 0.385, p = 0.465). The presence of elevated levels of fibronectin may indicate abnormalities in cell–ECM signalling during the course of endometriosis, and may be a potential biomarker for early detection.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f99bf3982b950ec7b868ad9e06596c98e5e91f63

Recent studies have suggested that prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) are pivotal regulators in the establishment of castration resistance. The nanog homeobox (NANOG) and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD) signaling pathways are involved in several cancer stem cells but are not involved in PCSCs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of NANOG on the proliferation of PCSCs regulated by the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway. Methods In this study, we used flow cytometry to isolate CD44+/CD133+/NANOG+ PCSCs from DU145 prostate cancer cells. Then we used short hairpin RNA to silence NANOG and observed the biological behavior and the TGF-β1/SMAD signal of PCSCs. Results NANOG decreased PCSC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and blocked cell cycling at G0/G1. Furthermore, reduction in the TGF-β1, p15, and p-SMAD2 expression was observed. Conclusion These findings suggest that NANOG positively regulates the growth of PCSCs through the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33aa78adab090d8cfba3de204a53e005c9aa29b8

The clear cell subtype of renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) constitutes the great majority of kidney cancer. Metastatic ccRCC portends a very poor outcome with no effective treatment available. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the US. Despite recent advances in selective kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies, the rate of developing new treatment from bench to bedside is slow. A time-consuming step is at the animal drug testing stage, in which the mouse model is the gold standard. In the pursuit to streamline the in vivo cancer biology research and drug development, we explored the feasibility of the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to establish xenografts. The CAM model greatly shortens the time of tumor growth and lowers the cost comparing to immunocompromised mice. We generated CAM xenografts from ccRCC, bladder and prostate cancer, with established cancer cell lines and freshly isolated patient-derived tissues, either as primary tumor cells or small pieces of tumors. The successful CAM engraftment rate from the different tumor sources is 70% or above. Using our previously established metastatic ccRCC mouse model, we showed that the CAM xenograft maintains the same tumor growth pattern and metastatic behavior as observed in mice. Taken together, CAM can serve as a valuable platform to establish new patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to study tumor biology, thus accelerating the development of individualized treatment to halt the deadly metastatic stage of cancer.;No;Yes;2019;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3363f54748321316dfd1a0a7990016133f0290d

In recent years, special attention has been paid to genetic mechanisms that can have a significant impact on the increased incidence of endometriosis. The study aimed to analyze the expression of four long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, UCA1, MALAT1, TC0101441, and H19, in the context of the risk of developing endometriosis. The material for genetic testing for the expression of lncRNA genes were tissue slices embedded in paraffin blocks from patients with endometriosis (n = 100) and the control group (n = 100). Gene expression was determined by the RT-PCR technique. The expression of the H19 gene in endometriosis patients was statistically significantly lower than in the control group. A statistically significant association was found between H19 gene expression in relation to The Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification of endometriosis (rASRM) in the group of patients with endometriosis.

Identifying molecular pathways underlying DTX resistance is critical for developing novel combinatorial therapies to prevent or reverse this resistance. To identify transcriptomic signatures associated with acquisition of chemoresistance we profiled gene expression in DTX-sensitive and -resistant mCRPC cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). PC3 and DU145 cells were selected for DTX resistance and this phenotype was validated by immunoblotting using DTX resistance markers (e.g. clusterin, ABCB1/P-gp, and LEDGF/p75). Overlapping genes differentially regulated in the DTX-sensitive and -resistant cells were ranked by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and validated to correlate transcript with protein expression. GSEA revealed that genes associated with cancer stem cells (CSC) (e.g., NES, TSPAN8, DPPP, DNAJC12, and MYC) were highly ranked and comprised 70% of the top 25 genes differentially upregulated in the DTX-resistant cells. Established markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSCs were used to evaluate the stemness of adherent DTX-resistant cells (2D cultures) and tumorspheres (3D cultures). Increased formation and frequency of cells expressing CSC markers were detected in DTX-resistant cells. DU145-DR cells showed a 2-fold increase in tumorsphere formation and increased DTX resistance compared to DU145-DR 2D cultures. These results demonstrate the induction of a transcriptomic program associated with stemness in mCRPC cells selected for DTX resistance, and strengthen the emerging body of evidence implicating CSCs in this process. In addition, they provide additional candidate genes and molecular pathways for potential therapeutic targeting to overcome DTX resistance.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ecf43ca2161c0c36e7c823143f96eda67530952

This scheme is a primitive that allows a semi-trusted entity called the “proxy” to convert the signcryption addressed to a “delegator” to those that can be de-signcrypted by a “delegatee”, by using some special information given by the delegator, called “rekey”. In the scheme, the proxy is not allowed to know the secret keys of the delegator or the delegatee, or the plaintext during the conversion. The proxy and delegatee, however, are not allowed to collude with each other. Compared to the existing scheme, the proxy re-signcryption proposed by us implements the full conversion—a signcryption under the keys for two parties can be transferred to another signcryption under another different two keys, and the verification of the signcryption can be progressed without the participation of plaintext. Meanwhile, the security of the scheme is proved under the ROM. Finally, we give the analysis of the efficiency, performance and the function of the scheme, which proves that the function of our scheme is stronger and more perfect than that of the existing schemes.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19c89b016362c80b276a4f05ccb3f80b236eddb9

The purpose of this work is to determine to what extent a history of endometriosis is a risk factor for ovarian cancer in a Spanish population. Methods: A retrospective case–control study was conducted using de-identified data from the Spanish National Health System’s “Primary Care Clinical Database” and “Hospital Minimum Basic Data Set” for the period 2013–2017. Multiple logistics regression analysis was conducted to determine associations between ovarian cancer and endometriosis controlled by sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities. Results: Data from 608,980 women were analyzed, with 4505 presenting ovarian cancer. Endometriosis patients were shown to have a 2.66-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer when compared to those who did not have endometriosis by controlling age and other relevant comorbidities. Conclusions: This case–control study based on clinical administrative data has found that a history of endometriosis is independently associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

Symptoms of severe pelvic pain, infertility, fatigue, and abnormal menstruation can cause significant negative effects on an individual’s physical and mental health, including interactions with their family, friends, and health care providers. Stigma associated with endometriosis has been under-studied and is rarely discussed in current literature. Herein, this paper aims to provide a brief overview of published literature to explore and establish the plausibility of stigma as a driver of suboptimal psychosocial well-being and diagnostic delay among individuals living with endometriosis. We present the clinical characteristics and physical and mental health consequences associated with endometriosis, highlight several theoretical constructs of stigma, and review the limited studies documenting women’s lived experiences of endometriosis-related stigma. To mitigate harmful effects of this phenomenon, we recommend increasing efforts to assess the prevalence of and to characterize endometriosis-related stigma, implementing awareness campaigns, and developing interventions that combat the multidimensional negative effects of stigma on timely care, treatment, and quality of life for individuals living with endometriosis.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b551920df05508941de5f3ef6097484b91fc9e3f

The lack of pharmacological treatments suitable for the long-term relief of endometriosis-associated pain, without an impact on fertility, remains an urgent unmet need. Progress has been slowed by the absence of a reproducible rodent endometriosis model that fully replicates human physiopathological characteristics, including pain symptoms. Although pain assessment in rodents is a complicated task requiring qualified researchers, the choice of the behavioral test is no less important, since selecting inappropriate tests can cause erroneous data. Pain is usually measured with reflex tests in which hypersensitivity is evaluated by applying a noxious stimulus, yet this ignores the associated emotional component that could be evaluated via non-reflex tests. We conducted a systematic review of endometriosis models used in rodents and the number of them that studied pain.

Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer several advantages. Unfortunately, few studies have compared the outcomes of different types of minimally invasive surgeries. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of robotic hysterectomy (RH) and conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy (CLH) in benign gynecologic diseases. We performed a retrospective cohort study at a single center between January 2014 and July 2022. A total of 397 patients (RH: 197 and CLH: 200) who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign diseases with uterine size exceeding 250 g were enrolled, and factors related to the surgical outcomes were compared. The median age was 46 (range, 35–74) years, and the median uterine weight was 400 (range, 250–2720) g. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, body mass index, uterine weight, hospital stay, estimated blood loss, or operating time. Intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were not significantly different between the two groups. RH was not inferior to CLH in terms of perioperative and immediate postoperative outcomes in our study.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec15b05210f503f8c8ea79a4f0f7f591a6df0eeb

Those book result decide.;Poster;Background: Depression is a common and potentially life-threatening mental illness, and currently, there is a lack of effective treatment. It has been reported that dehydrocorydaline (DHC) can inhibit monoamine transporter uptake in depressed CUMS mice, but more possible mechanisms of action remain to be further studied. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for five consecutive weeks. The mice were administrated with dehydrocorydaline or fluoxetine (FLU) for four consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were applied. In parallel, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining were used to explore the effect of DHC on pathological changes in the hippocampus. The concentrations of depression-related factors (5-HT and DA) and inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in the hippocampus and serum were assessed by ELISA assay. NLRP3 inflammasome pathway-related proteins (NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1 IL-1α, and caspase-1) were detected by western blot. The activation of microglia and astrocytes was subjected to immunofluorescent staining. Additionally, microglia were treated with DHC (100 mg/L) for 24 h following incubation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 12 h. ov-NC or ov-NLRP3 plasmid was transfected into microglia 6 h before LPS induction for exploring the effect of NLRP3 overexpression on DHC-inhibited microglia activation. Then, conditioned media of microglia were collected from each group, followed by intervention of astrocytes for 24 h to explore the effect of NLRP3 overexpression of microglia on astrocyte activation. Results: In vivo administration of DHC was found to ameliorate depressive-like behaviors and attenuate neuron damage of CUMS mice. DHC increased neurotransmitter concentration, reduced the proinflammatory factor levels, attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and decreased A1 astrocyte and microglia activation in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Furthermore, in vivo results showed that activated microglia induced activation of A1 astrocytes but not A2 astrocytes. Conclusion: Taken together, we provided evidence that DHC exhibited antidepressive effects on CUMS mice possibly via NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated astrocyte activation.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15d7263b82db617d12b2f09254ab3c3eaba021ae

There is an emerging philosophical shift from gold standard histopathological diagnosis through laparoscopy to establishing diagnosis through noninvasive imaging. Recent findings The ENZIAN classification system was updated in 2021 to be suitable for both diagnostic imaging and laparoscopy. The accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in diagnosing endometriosis varies depending on location of the lesion. A recent international pilot study found that when ultrasound is performed in accordance with the IDEA consensus, a higher detection of deep endometriosis is seen, with an overall sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 79% compared with direct surgical visualization. Summary Although ultrasound can detect adenomyosis, deep endometriosis and endometriomas, it is not possible to reliably detect superficial endometriosis.

To date, no formal recommendations have been made in defining a referral system for MIGS. This article reviews the evidence regarding common disorders and procedures and their outcomes, and posits a basis for MIGS referral. Recent findings In instances where intraoperative and perioperative features may pose clinical challenges to the surgeon and ultimately the patient, the literature suggests the following scenarios may have adverse outcomes, and therefore, benefit from the skills of MIGS subspecialists: fibroids – at least five myomas, myoma size at least 9 cm, and suspected myoma weight at least 500 g; endometriosis – presence of endometrioma(s), suspected stage III/IV endometriosis, and requirement for advanced adjunct procedures; hysterectomy – uteri at least 250 g or 12 weeks estimated size, at least three prior laparotomies, obesity, and complex surgical history with suspected adhesive disease. Summary A referral system for MIGS subspecialists has proven benefits for both the gynecologic surgical community as well as the patients and their outcomes.

A comprehensive description of the different manifestations of the disease can be found in the #Enzian classification. Since the operation is usually the foundation for the successful treatment of DE, what is important are conclusive indications, appropriate preoperative preparation and, above all, appropriate experience on the part of the surgical team. This article aims to provide a review of the surgical options that are currently available. Zusammenfassung Bei der tief infiltrierenden Endometriose (TIE) dringen endometriumartige Zellverbände mehr als 5 mm subperitoneal ein: In den betroffenen Organen und Gewebestrukturen kann es dabei zu einer Alteration der Anatomie mit aufgehobenen Organgrenzen kommen, was die operative Therapie im Einzelfall selbst für den Geübten zur Herausforderung werden lässt. Für eine umfassende Beschreibung der unterschiedlichen Manifestationen der Erkrankung liegt aktuell die #Enzian-Klassifikation vor. Da die Operation meistens die Grundlage einer erfolgreichen Behandlung der TIE ist, sind eine überzeugende Indikation, eine angemessene präoperative Vorbereitung, vor allem aber eine entsprechende Erfahrung des operativen Teams entscheidend für den Erfolg.

Previous studies using the finite element method have demonstrated the validity of this formulation, but have not demonstrated a systematic method of constructing the impedance and admittance matrices for simulation. These matrices for cables, with and without enclosing armours, are derived in this paper. Analytical examples are provided to demonstrate how each component impedance and admittance is incorporated into the loop based approach. This includes the proximity effects within the multi-core cables. The methods used in the analytical examples to calculate each component impedance and admittance can be modified without change to the demonstrated loop based formulation. This applies even if more advanced techniques are developed to calculate these components.

The myself country claim.;FullPaper;Elucidating the underlying genetic drivers of production traits in agricultural and aquaculture species is critical to efforts to maximize farming efficiency. “Omics” based methods (i.e., transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are increasingly being applied to gain unprecedented insight into the biology of many aquaculture species. While the culture of penaeid shrimp has increased markedly, the industry continues to be impeded in many regards by disease, reproductive dysfunction, and a poor understanding of production traits. Extensive effort has been, and continues to be, applied to develop critical genomic resources for many commercially important penaeids. However, the industry application of these genomic resources, and the translation of the knowledge derived from “omics” studies has not yet been completely realized. Integration between the multiple “omics” resources now available (i.e., genome assemblies, transcriptomes, linkage maps, optical maps, and proteomes) will prove critical to unlocking the full utility of these otherwise independently developed and isolated resources. Furthermore, emerging “omics” based techniques are now available to address longstanding issues with completing keystone genome assemblies (e.g., through long-read sequencing), and can provide cost-effective industrial scale genotyping tools (e.g., through low density SNP chips and genotype-by-sequencing) to undertake advanced selective breeding programs (i.e., genomic selection) and powerful genome-wide association studies. In particular, this review highlights the status, utility and suggested path forward for continued development, and improved use of “omics” resources in penaeid aquaculture.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86a805a0304aef0193924d9cb970bcc69c7a8275

Easy first think energy continue begin herself.;Poster;SUMMARY Exposure of prawns to dark- or light-coloured substrates is known to trigger a strong colour adaptation response through expansion or contraction of the colouration structures in the prawn hypodermis. Despite the difference in colour triggered by this adaptive response, total levels of the predominant carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin, are not modified, suggesting that another mechanism is regulating this phenomenon. Astaxanthin binds to a specific protein called crustacyanin (CRCN), and it is the interaction between the quantities of each of these compounds that produces the diverse range of colours seen in crustacean shells. In this study, we investigated the protein changes and genetic regulatory processes that occur in prawn hypodermal tissues during adaptation to black or white substrates. The amount of free astaxanthin was higher in animals adapted to dark substrate compared with those adapted to light substrate, and this difference was matched by a strong elevation of CRCN protein. However, there was no difference in the expression of CRCN genes either across the moult cycle or in response to background substrate colour. These results indicate that exposure to a dark-coloured substrate causes an accumulation of CRCN protein, bound with free astaxanthin, in the prawn hypodermis without modification of CRCN gene expression. On light-coloured substrates, levels of CRCN protein in the hypodermis are reduced, but the carotenoid is retained, undispersed in the hypodermal tissue, in an esterified form.

True economy method something shake four store market.;Poster;Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is critical in the development and regulation of reproduction in fish. The inhibition of neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression may diminish or severely hamper gonadal development due to it being the key regulator of the axis, and then provide a model for the comprehensive study of the expression patterns of genes with respect to the fish reproductive system. Methodology/Principal Findings In a previous study we injected 342 fertilized eggs from the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with a gene construct that expressed antisense sGnRH. Four years later, we found a total of 38 transgenic fish with abnormal or missing gonads. From this group we selected the 12 sterile females with abnormal ovaries in which we combined suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray analysis to define changes in gene expression of the HPG axis in the present study. As a result, nine, 28, and 212 genes were separately identified as being differentially expressed in hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary, of which 87 genes were novel. The number of down- and up-regulated genes was five and four (hypothalamus), 16 and 12 (pituitary), 119 and 93 (ovary), respectively. Functional analyses showed that these genes involved in several biological processes, such as biosynthesis, organogenesis, metabolism pathways, immune systems, transport links, and apoptosis. Within these categories, significant genes for neuropeptides, gonadotropins, metabolic, oogenesis and inflammatory factors were identified. Conclusions/Significance This study indicated the progressive scaling-up effect of hypothalamic sGnRH antisense on the pituitary and ovary receptors of female carp and provided comprehensive data with respect to global changes in gene expression throughout the HPG signaling pathway, contributing towards improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and regulative pathways in the reproductive system of teleost fish.;Yes;Yes;2011;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/477d6a84eda0560d10c2d63238390d9c9dcd6ec8

It shares all resources that are distributed over various nodes of a network, which makes effective computing easier and smarter. But this has also raised some problems in consistency of objects stored at various nodes in the network. These problems can be sorted out by using various protocols that are specifically designed for the purpose. This paper proposes one such protocol, which is fully distributed; the key solution in addressing the problem of inconsistency in distributed environment is the use of OO-Middleware, which ensures active software object replication in the server side. Various protocols are available which use replication at the middleware but this raises problems in multi-operating dependence environment. Replication of object at the server side ensures the consistency of objects. Some problems of sequential paradigm of consistency are also addressed in this paper.

We consider the joint optimization in both relay assignment for each source-destination pair and power allocation, which is in fact among the hardest problems in optimization. This is the minimization of a nonconvex objective function subject to mixed integer constraints. The existing numerical algorithms could rarely address to its solutions through computationally affordable procedures. Even the conventional relaxation of the integer constraints by linear constraints does not lead to convex optimization, so the standard convexification does not work either. Nevertheless, we show that it can be effectively solved in the d.c. (difference of two convex) programming context.

The upper bound for the optimisation problem considered is first determined by ignoring some constraints. Thereafter, a genetic algorithm (GA) is addressed to resolve the mixed-integer non-linear programming problem involved. To accommodate this joint consideration, each chromosome in the proposed GA is divided into an integer string for relay selection, and two real number strings for bandwidth allocation and power distribution. In addition, new crossover and mutation operations are employed for this new type of chromosomes. To alleviate the complexity overhead, a low-complexity two-stage implementation is also addressed. Conducted simulations show that both of the proposed GA and the two-stage implementation can attain close performance as the upper bound and outperform some representative previous works. The two-stage implementation is in particular appealing by exhibiting negligible performance degradation with reduced computations.;Yes;Yes;2014;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/887c25cbb67e83aefcac895a449b6b5e96e4577b

Feel among yeah build interview budget exactly agreement.;FullPaper;In cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs), there has been growing demand of transmitting secondary user (SU) source information secretly to the corresponding SU destination with the aid of cooperative SU relays. Efficient power allocation (PA) among SU relays and multi-relay selection (MRS) are a critical problem for operating such networks whereas the interference to the primary user receiver is being kept below a tolerable level and the transmission power requirements of the secondary users are being satisfied. Subsequently, in the paper, we develop the problem to solve the optimal solution for PA and MRS in a collaborative amplify-and-forward-based CCRNs, in terms of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) of the networks. It is found that the problem is a mixed integer programming problem and difficult to be solved. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a meta-heuristic genetic algorithm-based MRS and PA scheme to maximize the SR of the networks while satisfying transmission power and the interference requirements of the networks. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal SR performance, compared to the exhaustive search scheme, and provides a significant SR improvement when compared with some conventional relay selection schemes with equal power allocation.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca795342058fb17514171bc6ffdb6ceff42bac65

Head tell any main.;DemoPaper;Node cooperation approaches improve physical layer security in wireless networks without applying data encryption. Selecting the appropriate nodes to cooperate as relays or friendly jammers, to degrade eavesdropper's link, is a challenging problem which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Various approaches, based on conventional exhaustive search, have been suggested for optimal relay-jammer selection and power allocation in the literature. The complexity of these methods is proportional to the number of intermediate nodes. As the number of intermediate nodes exceeds a specific bound, conventional exhaustive search appears infeasible due to high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on genetic algorithm (GA), for relay-jammer selection, power allocation and computational complexity reduction. Our system model consists of a source-destination pair, one eavesdropper and a number of intermediate nodes which cooperate as relays or friendly jammers. Considering the achievable secrecy rate as the cost function for GA optimization, the proposed algorithm is performed in two steps. First, we determine the desired channel gains that maximize the secrecy rate using GA. In the second step, nodes for which the corresponding channel gains have the smallest deviation from the obtained values in the first step, will be chosen as relays or jammers. We compare the proposed method with two kinds of conventional exhaustive search techniques one with fixed and the other with adaptive power allocated to jammers. Simulation results show that the proposed method reduces computational complexity while attaining a secrecy rate close to conventional techniques. Also the power which is allocated to jammers during each phase of transmission will be declined using GA optimization. Despite of conventional exhaustive search, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is almost the same as the number of cooperative nodes increases. So, the proposed method will outperform the previous works in terms of simplicity, efficiency and security.;No;Yes;2016;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f45fb6e721d06dc0903e543b705a366c955c232

The knowledge of possible mechanisms shaping personality disorders in childhood is unsatisfactory and needs to be expanded. Developmental psychology explains the development of abnormal personality through inappropriate attachment patterns and abnormal transitions between developmental phases. Genetic and temperamental factors are also important in the aetiology of personality disorders as well as early maladaptive schemas resulting from personal experiences and interactions with others.

However, no study has explored the relationship between childhood abuse and memory impairment during pregnancy. This study is the first to explore the relationship between childhood abuse and subjective memory impairment. Participants, Setting, and Methods: A total of 1,825 pregnant women were recruited from a comprehensive hospital in Shandong province, China, and completed a questionnaire survey. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between childhood abuse and subjective prospective and retrospective memory. Results: Pregnant women with high total childhood abuse scores had high prospective and retrospective memory impairment. Among pregnant women reporting only emotional abuse, only physical abuse, or only sexual abuse, women reporting only emotional abuse were found to have high prospective and retrospective memory impairment. Women with all three childhood abuse types also had high prospective and retrospective memory impairment. Conclusion: Women who experienced childhood abuse, especially childhood emotional abuse, had high subjective memory impairment during pregnancy. It is important to ask pregnant women about their experiences of childhood abuse, especially emotional abuse, during early prenatal care, as such abuse is likely to have negative effects on memory during pregnancy.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f16d7b9728b546a9212c2bd0d7d7766533389019

One way to measure memory disturbances and their functional implications is via a memory questionnaire. Several pediatric memory questionnaires have been published but no systematic review has been conducted to establish their psychometric properties. This review evaluated currently available pediatric memory questionnaires using the Evidence-Based Assessment (EBA) criteria developed by the American Psychological Association Task force. A systematic search of CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsychINFO was completed on June 2019. The selection process was guided by pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by full manuscript reviews, and hand-search of reference lists of relevant papers. Selected questionnaires were evaluated by two independent raters against the EBA criteria and classified into “well established”, “approaching well-established”, and “promising” categories. The electronic searches yielded 9888 articles, 24 of which met the inclusion criteria. Hand searches identified additional 21 studies. The 45 identified studies reported on 24 versions of 10 memory questionnaires assessed working memory, everyday memory, prospective and retrospective memory, and self-awareness of memory functions. Based on EBA criteria, only one memory questionnaire (The Working Memory Rating Scale – 20 item version) was classified as “well-established”, 3 as “approaching well-established”, and 20 as “promising”. Most (n = 19) had good reliability but lacked concurrent validity; had low or no correlations with objective memory tests, and low predictive power. In conclusion, this review highlights an urgent need for the development and validation of pediatric memory questionnaires to increase the evidence base and improve questionnaires’ clinical utility.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e1c8fcdceb485a124f91e22eb8ca11dd688a588

Using 20-year follow-up data from a unique natural experiment – the large-scale adoption of children exposed to extreme deprivation in Romanian institutions in the 1980s –we examined, for the first time, whether such deficits are still present in adulthood and whether they are associated with deprivation-related symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods Adult neuropsychological functioning was assessed across five domains (inhibitory control, emotion recognition, decision-making, prospective memory and IQ) in 70 previously institutionalized adoptees (mean age = 25.3, 50% female) and 22 non-deprived UK adoptees (comparison group, mean age = 24.6, 41% female). ADHD and ASD symptoms were assessed using parent-completed questionnaires. Results Early institutionalization was associated with impaired performance on all tasks in adulthood. Prospective memory deficits persisted after controlling for IQ. ADHD and ASD symptoms were positively correlated. After controlling for ASD symptoms, ADHD symptoms remained associated with deficits in IQ, prospective memory, proactive inhibition, decision-making quality and emotion recognition. ASD symptoms were not independently associated with neuropsychological deficits when accounting for their overlap with ADHD symptoms. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the link between childhood deprivation and adult ADHD symptoms was statistically explained by deprivation-related differences in adult IQ and prospective memory. Conclusions These results represent some of the most compelling evidence to date of the enduring power of early, time-limited childhood adversity to impair long-term neuropsychological functioning across the lifespan – effects that are linked specifically to deprivation-related adult ADHD symptoms.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8487d5758ced07a1f2926f653f88124527943262

Fish genotoxicity biomarkers are vital to identify and complement chemical parameters for determining environmental risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it was of interest to examine the eco-genotoxicity attributed to water pollution over different stream sections of Brazilian rivers by using Cichlasoma paranaense (Teleostei: Cichlidae), a neotropical freshwater cichlid ﬁsh, as a biological model. Chemical analysis of water and sediments collected from different Brazilian rivers sites demonstrated contamination by metals. Cichlasoma paranaense were collected at a reference location (a permanent water preservation area), maintained in the lab under standard conditions (controlled temperature, lighting, daily feeding, and constant aeration) and exposed to environmental samples of water and sediments. Subsequently, micronucleus (MN) and nuclear abnormalities (NA) frequencies were assessed in erythrocytes obtained from the caudal and gill regions. The highest concentrations of Cu were found in samples from river sites with forest fragmentation attributed to intensive agriculture practices. Similarly, exposure of fish to samples from agricultural areas induced significantly higher number of genotoxic effects. There was no marked difference between the tissues (tail and gill) regarding the observed frequencies of MN and NA. Thus C. paranaense fish served as a reliable model for detecting genotoxic effects, especially when water samples were collected near the discharge of agrochemicals. Evidence indicates that this method be considered for other global river sites which are also exposed to agrochemicals discharges containing Cu.;Yes;No;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07e19b89864bfd986cc01b94f91cfa795393bf49

Environmental pollution is one of its drivers, including contamination of wildlife by chemicals emitted into the air, soil, and water. Chemicals released into the environment, even at low concentrations, may pose a negative effect on organisms. These chemicals might modify the synthesis, metabolism, and mode of action of hormones. This can lead to failures in reproduction, growth, and development of organisms potentially impacting their fitness. In this review, we focused on assessing the current knowledge on concentrations and possible effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals (metals, persistent organic pollutants, and others) in studies performed in South America, with findings at reproductive and thyroid levels. Our literature search revealed that most studies have focused on measuring the concentrations of compounds that act as endocrine disruptors in animals at the systemic level. However, few studies have evaluated the effects at a reproductive level, while information at thyroid disorders is scarce. Most studies have been conducted in fish by researchers from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Comparison of results across studies is difficult due to the lack of standardization of units in the reported data. Future studies should prioritize research on emergent contaminants, evaluate effects on native species and the use of current available methods such as the OMICs. Additionally, there is a primary focus on organisms related to aquatic environments, and those inhabiting terrestrial environments are scarce or nonexistent. Finally, we highlight a lack of funding at a national level in the reviewed topic that may influence the observed low scientific productivity in several countries, which is often negatively associated with their percentage of protected areas.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2557e6b62e6c152dd7c42c6542d2017a5db0a32

Individual argue bank beat store unit lawyer set.;Poster;Abstract Alkylphenols, a nonionic surface-active agent group, such as nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) are important endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC). In this study, the dose- and time-dependent effects of NP and OP were investigated in the primary hepatocyte culture of Van Fish. In this study, samples were taken at different times and biochemical parameters were studied separately. The effects of the chemicals used on SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA, and 8-OHdG were investigated in hepatocyte culture. The antioxidants SOD and CAT were observed to increase in all groups in the primary hepatocyte cultures at the 24th hour after NP and OP administration, whereas the GSH-Px level was observed to increase with OP at the 24th hour and with NP at the 48th hour. The MDA level was observed to reach its highest value for both chemicals in the 24th hour, and the 8-OHdG level was observed to increase toward the end of the follow-up time, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, different doses of NP and OP were found to induce an increase in the levels of antioxidants and the MDA level in Van Fish primary hepatocyte culture. DNA damage, on the other hand, may be considered to appear after longer-term exposure to NP and OP.;Yes;No;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7344872c24a763661009d375d66fc38867b8d599

Chronic toxicity assays were performed following an ISO guideline in a Tropical Artificial Soil (TAS), and the influence on the number and growth of the juveniles produced were determined. The range of nominal concentrations used in the tests with the individual compounds was 0.08–1.28 mg/kg (IMI), 0.079–1.264 mg/kg (FIP) and 0.007–0.112 mg/kg (CLO), whereas the mixture assays were performed with half the value used in the tests with individual compounds. Based upon single exposures, IMI produced a similar impact of reducing reproduction by 50% (EC50 ranging from 0.74 to 0.85 mg/kg) compared to FIP (EC50 = 0.78 mg/kg), whereas CLO was the most toxic to F. candida (EC50 = 0.08 mg/kg). Their mixtures generally resulted in a diminished effect on reproduction, as evidenced by the higher EC50 values. In contrast, in the case of the IMI+FIP combination at high concentrations at the EC50 level, a synergistic effect on toxicity was observed. The single exposure to the three insecticides and the mixture of IMI-FIP also decreased the size of generated juveniles, which was evidenced by the reduction in the proportion of large juveniles and increased proportion of small juveniles. However, both binary mixtures (IMI-FIP and IMI-CLO) presented antagonistic effects as evidenced by less than expected reductions in growth. Data on the toxic effects of IMI in a mixture with other seed dressing insecticides to collembolans provides useful information to environmental risk assessors by diminishing the uncertainties on the ecological risk of exposure to pesticides, enabling soil management degradation by utilizing multiple insecticides.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1bb6e6f219503a87560727a8364a5705651f220

Administration condition word box clear spend one.;DemoPaper;Abstract The lateral hypothalamus is critical for the control of ingestive behavior and spontaneous physical activity (SPA), as lesion or stimulation of this region alters these behaviors. Evidence points to lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons as modulators of feeding and SPA. These neurons affect a broad range of systems, and project to multiple brain regions such as the dorsal raphe nucleus, which contains serotoninergic neurons (DRN) important to energy homeostasis. Physical activity is comprised of intentional exercise and SPA. These are opposite ends of a continuum of physical activity intensity and structure. Non‐goal‐oriented behaviors, such as fidgeting, standing, and ambulating, constitute SPA in humans, and reflect a propensity for activity separate from intentional activity, such as high‐intensity voluntary exercise. In animals, SPA is activity not influenced by rewards such as food or a running wheel. Spontaneous physical activity in humans and animals burns calories and could theoretically be manipulated pharmacologically to expend calories and protect against obesity. The DRN neurons receive orexin inputs, and project heavily onto cortical and subcortical areas involved in movement, feeding and energy expenditure (EE). This review discusses the function of hypothalamic orexin in energy‐homeostasis, the interaction with DRN serotonin neurons, and the role of this orexin‐serotonin axis in regulating food intake, SPA, and EE. In addition, we discuss possible brain areas involved in orexin–serotonin cross‐talk; the role of serotonin receptors, transporters and uptake‐inhibitors in the pathogenesis and treatment of obesity; animal models of obesity with impaired serotonin‐function; single‐nucleotide polymorphisms in the serotonin system and obesity; and future directions in the orexin–serotonin field.

The neuroendocrine system is a target of endocrine disruptors, such as psychoactive pharmaceuticals, which are common aquatic contaminants. We hypothesized that exposure to an antidepressant pollutant, fluoxetine, influences the physiological stress response in our model species, crucian carp, affecting its behavioral and morphological responses to predation threat. We examined short‐ and long‐term effects of fluoxetine and predator exposure on behavior and morphology in crucian carp. Seventeen days of exposure to a high dose of fluoxetine (100 µg/L) resulted in a shyer phenotype, regardless of the presence/absence of a pike predator, but this effect disappeared after long‐term exposure. Fluoxetine effects on morphological plasticity were context‐dependent as a low dose (1 µg/L) only influenced crucian carp body shape in pike presence. A high dose of fluoxetine strongly influenced body shape regardless of predator treatment. Our results highlight that environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals could disrupt physiological regulation of ecologically important inducible defenses.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ecf950f95fa5e96ef7d1dfb9099b2c1b4e2b24b

Once budget they where partner. Authority job occur early.;Poster;Background The aquatic environment has been contaminated with various anthropogenic pollutants, including psychoactive compounds that may alter the physiology and behavior of free-living organisms. The present study focused on the condition and related mortality of the juvenile chub (Squalius cephalus). The aim of the study was to test whether the adverse effects of the antidepressants sertraline and citalopram, the analgesic tramadol and the illicit drug methamphetamine, on fish condition exist under environmentally relevant concentrations and whether these effects persist after a depuration period. Innovative analyses of the fish brain concentrations of these compounds were performed with the aim to show relationship between compound brain tissue concentration and fish condition. Methods The laboratory experiment consisted of 42 days of exposure and a subsequent 14-day depuration period with regular monitoring of the condition and mortality of exposed and control fish. Identical methodology, including individual brain concentration analyses for the tested compounds, was applied for all substances. Additional study on feeding under sertraline exposure was also conducted. The feeding was measured from the 28th day of the exposure, three times in a week, by observation of food intake during 15 minutes in social environment. Results The effects of particular psychoactive compounds on chub condition varied. While sertraline induced a lower condition and increased mortality, the effects of methamphetamine were inverse, and tramadol and citalopram had no significant effect at all. Individual brain concentrations of the tested compounds showed that the effects of sertraline and methamphetamine on fish condition were increased with brain concentration increases. Additionally, the food intake was reduced in case of sertraline. In contrast, there was no relationship between tramadol and citalopram brain tissue concentration and fish condition, suggesting that the concentration-dependent effect is strongly compound-specific. Methamphetamine was the only compound with a persistent effect after the depuration period. Our results demonstrate the suitability of the brain concentration evidence approach and suggest that changes in fish condition and other related parameters can be expected in freshwater ecosystems polluted with specific psychoactive compounds.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2239dd93c7b350d1563433006006fac3cde9342c

This fish is an important source of protein for the people living in Van and surrounding provinces. . Cypermethrin (CYP) is used extensively against insects in agricultural, livestock, and domestic applications in Lake Van basin. CYP has toxic effects highly on non-target organisms as aquatic animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial formulas of CYP (0.05 µg/L) on Van Lake fish (Alburnus tarichi) for 24, 48, 72, 96 h under semi-static conditions using oxidative damage biomarkers. In this study, antioxidant defense system enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and lipid peroxidation (LPO) product malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in the liver, kidney, gills, and brain tissues. According to the results of this study, the decrease in SOD (at 48, 72, and 96 h) and CAT and GPx (at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) enzyme activities were significant with exposure to CYP (p < 0.05). In addition, the increase in MDA levels, which is the indicator of LPO, was found to be significant (p < 0.05). However, in the 24 h period exposed to CYP, a significant increase in SOD activity was determined in kidney and brain compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, sublethal concentrate application of CYP is thought to cause oxidative stress and disrupt the oxidant, antioxidant balance of Lake Van fish.;No;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74c1ab46a2ea1566c11706752982040d15137e8f

The widely prescribed antidiabetic metformin has the potential to accumulate and persist in water bodies, with unknown consequences for aquatic biota. This study reports the biological responses of a sentinel organism, common mussel Mytilus edulis, exposed to concentrations of metformin commonly found in the aquatic environment, coupled with heat stress. The results indicate that metformin has the potential to increase the vitellogenin mRNA expression, to inflict severe pathologies of the gonad and to destabilize the lysosomal membrane in the hemocytes. Overall, this article suggests that metformin should be considered an emerging contaminant of concern and further research should focus on its mechanisms of action.;Yes;Yes;2018;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6dfea27e6fb98d95e18dfb443b95027f0478c732

Product level wait myself.;Poster;Objectives: Limited data are currently available regarding anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) use and outcomes in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) patients. We aimed to assess the long-term outcomes and time to progression to anti-TNF treatment in VEOIBD patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed IBD patients diagnosed under 6 years of age, between January 2005 and December 2019, from the British-Columbia (BC) Pediatric IBD database. Demographic data, disease characteristics, disease location and severity were documented. Data on anti-TNF treatment at initiation and during follow up including type of biologic, dosing, and response were collected. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the number of years to progression to anti-TNF treatment and the parameters influencing commencement. Results: Eighty-nine patients with VEOIBD were diagnosed during the study period. Median age at diagnosis was 3.8 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.6–5.1], 45.3% had Crohn disease (CD) and 62.8% were males. Median duration of follow up was 6.39 years (IQR 3.71–10.55). Anti-TNF treatment was started on 39.5% of patients and 7.0% underwent surgery. Rapid progression to biologic treatment was associated with Perianal fistulizing disease or stricturing disease in CD patients (P = 0.026, P = 0.033, respectively), and disease severity (P = 0.017) in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The median dose of infliximab at 1 year was 10 mg/kg (IQR 7.5–11) and a median dose interval of 4.5 weeks (IQR 4–6). Clinical remission was reported in 61.8% of patients on their first biologic agent. Conclusions: The response rate was higher than previously reported and might be due to higher infliximab dosing with shorter infusion intervals than standard dosing.;No;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a7abbbb996f512c3af43b13518531873b5cb1d0

The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of PIBD in Turkey, according to the age at diagnosis. Methods: The data of 176 children with IBD who were followed in our center were analyzed. Patients were divided into early (EO-IBD, onset at 2 to <10 years) and later-onset (LO-IBD, 10 to ≤17 years) IBD according to the age at diagnosis. Patients’ data with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) were compared. Results: Of 176 patients, 47 (26.7%) were diagnosed with EO-IBD. Patients with early-onset ulcerative colitis (EO-UC) had the highest rate of family history of IBD (17.6%). Pancolitis was the most common form of UC regardless of the age at onset. The rate of moderate-severe disease activity in later-onset UC (62.5%) was higher than in EO-UC (37.5%). A higher rate of extraintestinal manifestations was observed in EO-IBD patients, particularly in EO-UC (38.2%) than in LO-IBD patients. Patients with early-onset CD (EO-CD) had predominantly colonic involvement and nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease behavior. The rate of perianal disease in patients with later-onset CD (LO-CD) (64.5%) was noticeably higher than those with EO-CD (23%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with EO-UC represented a distinct phenotype with a mild disease activity, high rate of extraintestinal symptoms, and a high proportion of family history. The analysis of our IBD cohort also demonstrated remarkably high rate of perianal disease, particularly in patients with LO-CD.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/740fa92b37e157e83e59ccb2fe0c719da14b1481

Lay kind something. President research focus help.;ShortPaper;The smart grid is generally studied as an efficient and powerful electric grid. With the assistance of information and communication technology (ICT), the electric grid can increase the performance of the power grid system with smart energy management. On the other hand, with the usage of renewable energy resources (RERs), smart energy storage, and new transmission technologies in the power grid system, various new features such as real-time monitoring, fast restoration, battery displays, automated outage management, etc. have been assimilated into the smart grid. These new features generate more complexity in energy transmission and constitute important challenges like low energy consumption, high energy cost, social welfare, etc. while designing energy trading mechanisms in the smart grid. In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, several scenarios such as micro-grids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are present where energy trading plays an important role. However, in these scenarios, there are energy transmission and distribution, security and privacy, energy consumption, system reliability, the criticality of data delivery, and a few more challenges caused by distrust, non-transparent, and uncertain energy markets. Motivated from these challenges, we present a four-layered architecture of energy trading used in the smart grid. We propose a comprehensive background regarding the main concepts of energy trading and the implication of enabling technologies that manage the energy imbalances in the smart grid. Then, we present a problem taxonomy based on incentive, mathematical, and simulation model-driven approaches, which are widely used to control and maintain the energy trading mechanisms. Based on the findings from the literature, we also present a solution taxonomy with enabling technologies such as Energy Internet, Software-defined networking (SDN), and blockchain. In the end, a summary of future research directions based on the energy trading mechanisms is explored to provide deep insights to the readers.;No;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3b064763e4fc4603ea44702b47a6b9c4ad07314

Happy story black pattern. Great writer compare sea teacher itself road. Wear network fish morning eat.;If both when structure Democrat. Its discover sign. Hard claim behind president.;ShortPaper;Context: Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential to software quality. Studies have shown that software engineers often make mistakes, such as insufficient or misunderstood requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to support all the RE phases, especially eliciting requirements. In this context, Design Thinking (DT) is commonly used to deal with these problems. DT aims at bringing quality to software development to achieve users’ needs. It has a set of techniques and methods that can help software engineers properly elicit requirements to achieve this goal. However, in the literature, there are several techniques and selecting an appropriate one is not a trivial task. Some approaches support the selection of techniques, including DTA4RE and Selection Universe. Objective: This paper aims to analyze the performance of these two approaches to selecting DT techniques in terms of accuracy. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment to obtain the data. We have applied quantitative and qualitative analysis to the data. Results: Regarding the quantitative results, we found no significant difference in accuracy between the Universe Selection approaches and the DTA4RE. Regarding the qualitative results, we found that grouping the techniques into categories presented by the Selection Universe allowed us to reduce the search time for the techniques from DT since the approach allowed us to associate the system features with the techniques that can be used. Conclusion: We found that the two approaches satisfactorily supported the selection of DT techniques for various requirements elicitation activities. In the participants’ perception, the selection universe was helpful because the approach is intuitive. Also, the categorization of techniques made it easier to find the appropriate techniques for the proposed scenarios.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9aaeafa82aa89888b88d1b1b413e883703f9037b

Ground believe color easy art over.;DemoPaper;Agile methods focus on high quality, frequent deliveries, and customer and development team communication. Despite emphasizing customer involvement, in practice end users commonly do not participate in the early stages of these methods; instead, other business-related customers represent them in defining end-user needs. As a result, the produced software often does not satisfy the actual users’ needs, and the User Experience (UX) suffers. User-centered design, Design Thinking, and Lean Startup have been combined with agile methods to support defining the problem focused on user needs and producing effective software. Lean Inception (LI) represents a workshop that combines Design Thinking and Lean Startup. However, the effectiveness of problem definition and end-user participation in LIs is little explored. This paper presents a case study addressing this gap, investigating the use of LIs to define the problem and how the participation of end users in this context contributes to the resulting UX. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with customers and end-users of an agile software project using LI. Our analysis suggests that, while LI supports the identification of business goals, more details about user needs and software requirements are needed to support designers and developers in understanding the problem and evaluating its feasibility. We also identified a mischaracterization of user journeys and personas in LIs due to the short time dedicated to their creation, hampering the discussion of relevant UX issues. Finally, we observed that, when end users were present in the early stages, they helped the development team to design software that fits into their routine, improving the UX and increasing its adoption. We qualitatively discuss these issues and gains of directly involving end users and not “proxy” stakeholders in LI’s.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13374dea70d7f976a1e7b65840d603728a674aa6

Methods Retrospective review of all children commenced on LUM/IVA treatment over a one-year period. CT Thorax images were reviewed for evidence of air trapping using the Brody score. Results Data was collected from 15 children. A transient decline in ppFEV1 was observed after initiation of LUM/IVA in 93% (n=14) of patients with an absolute mean decline of -10.8%. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between ΔFEV1 and baseline ppFEV1. There was no relationship between air trapping score and ΔFEV1 (p=0.41).

Relationship deal generation leg relationship.;FullPaper;Design Thinking (DT) has been incorporated into software processes by teams from startups to large companies, used in problem exploration fostering innovative solutions, and integrated into agile methods to satisfy the real stakeholders’ needs. DT places the customer needs up-front and helps to empathize with users, examining their behaviors, and producing outcomes focused on users’ demand. A set of techniques, like personas and user journey, can be used to support this human-centered approach. Selecting which technique to use might be challenging since factors such as the application scenario, stakeholder engagement level and previous knowledge of the problem-to-be-solved may vary from case to case. In our previous work we presented a DT session conducted to better understand the need for a recommendation tool, followed by a requirements elicitation activity in which we defined how the tool should work, and an early evaluation of the initial tool low-fidelity prototypes. Inspired by the Design Science Research method, in this article we extend our previous work by furthering what we performed in the tool’s definition process. We included in this work a requirements refining activity through high-level fidelity prototypes, and a requirements validation activity through a questionnaire-based feedback collection with professionals who have experience on the use of DT in software development. Our results show that our proposal offers an useful and easy to use tool to recommend DT techniques with the potential to support those professionals who apply DT in requirements engineering by suggesting techniques that are the best fit to the declared context.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01288719404686d8759a96ff0cef799b92fb22ff

Do energy daughter despite like grow practice.;Poster;Recurrent and chronic bacterial infections are common in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and contribute to lung function decline. Antibiotics are the mainstay in the treatment of exacerbations and chronic bacterial infection in CF. Inhaled antibiotics are effective in treating chronic respiratory bacterial infections and eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the respiratory tract, with limited systemic adverse effects. In the past decade, highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have become a new therapy that partially corrects/opens chloride transport in patients with selected CFTR mutations, restoring mucus hydration and improving mucociliary clearance. The recent triple CFTR modulator combination is approved for ∼80–90% of the CF population and significantly reduces pulmonary exacerbations and improves respiratory symptoms and lung function. CFTR modulators have shifted the focus from symptomatic treatment to personalised/precision medicine by targeting genotype-specific CFTR defects. While these are highly effective, they do not fully normalise lung physiology, stop inflammation or resolve chronic lung damage, such as bronchiectasis. The impact of these new drugs on lung health is likely to change the future management of chronic pulmonary infections in people with CF. This article reviews the role of inhaled antibiotics in the era of CFTR modulators.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fb5187ccefdc045d5a6208d9cd84d0d80f47ada

Methods: This was a prospective observational study carried out in a CF referral center in Portugal involving adult CF patients who started treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. Clinical characteristics of the patients were collected, and effectiveness and safety data were evaluated. Results: Of the 56 patients followed in the center at the time of the study, 28 were eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in accordance with the Portuguese National Authority for Medicines and Health Products at the time of the study. Of these, 24 met the follow-up time requirement to be included in the clinical effectiveness analysis. The mean follow-up time was 167.3 ± 96.4 days. Adverse events were generally mild and self-limited. Significant improvements in lung function, BMI, sweat chloride concentration, and number of pulmonary exacerbations were observed. No significant differences in outcomes between F508del homozygous and heterozygous patients were found. The effectiveness of this new CFTR modulator combination also applied to patients with advanced lung disease. Conclusions: Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA showed effective improvement in real-world clinical practice, namely in lung function, BMI, sweat chloride concentration, and number of pulmonary exacerbations, with no safety concerns.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33538b220688bbcd48a81f77c66bfb28fa1113f0

However, it is of great importance to identify potential off-targets of these novel therapies to understand how they affect lung physiology in CF. ABSTRACT Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators improve clinical outcomes with varied efficacies in patients with CF. However, the mutual effects of CFTR modulators and bacterial adaptation, together with antibiotic regimens, can influence clinical outcomes. We evaluated the effects of ivacaftor (IVA), lumacaftor (LUM), tezacaftor, elexacaftor, and a three-modulator combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI), alone or combined with antibiotics, on sequential CF isolates. IVA and ETI showed direct antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus but not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive effects or synergies were observed between the CFTR modulators and antibiotics against both species, independently of adaptation to the CF lung. IVA and LUM were the most effective in potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus, while IVA and ETI enhanced mainly polymyxin activity against P. aeruginosa. Next, we evaluated the effect of P. aeruginosa pneumonia on the pharmacokinetics of IVA in mice. IVA and its metabolites in plasma, lung, and epithelial lining fluid were increased by P. aeruginosa infection. Thus, CFTR modulators can have direct antimicrobial properties and/or enhance antibiotic activity against initial and adapted S. aureus and P. aeruginosa isolates. Furthermore, bacterial infection impacts airway exposure to IVA, potentially affecting its efficacy. Our findings suggest optimizing host- and pathogen-directed therapies to improve efficacy for personalized treatment. IMPORTANCE CFTR modulators have been developed to correct and/or enhance CFTR activity in patients with specific cystic fibrosis (CF) genotypes. However, it is of great importance to identify potential off-targets of these novel therapies to understand how they affect lung physiology in CF. Since bacterial infections are one of the hallmarks of CF lung disease, the effects (if any) of CFTR modulators on bacteria could impact their efficacy. This work highlights a mutual interaction between CFTR modulators and opportunistic bacterial infections; in particular, it shows that (i) CFTR modulators have an antibacterial activity per se and influence antibiotic efficacy, and (ii) bacterial airway infections affect levels of CFTR modulators in the airways. These findings may help optimize host- and pathogen-directed drug regimens to improve the efficacy of personalized treatment.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70cdd8e8272ac905cf928f96940e1ae7fbedc589

Hundred clearly today window leader history.;Poster;The new breakthrough cystic fibrosis (CF) drug combination of ivacaftor (IVA), tezacaftor (TEZ), and elexacaftor (ELX), namely “caftor” drugs, directly modulates the activity and trafficking of the defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) underlying the CF disease. The role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of caftor drugs in clinical settings has recently been established. The availability of reliable and robust analytical methods for the quantification of IVA, TEZ, and ELX is essential to support dose–concentration–effect studies. We have developed and validated a new liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for the rapid and simultaneous quantification of IVA, TEZ, and ELX from the plasma of CF patients. The method was based on a rapid extraction protocol from 50 μL human plasma and separation on a reversed-phase C-18 HPLC column after the addition of deuterated internal standards. Accurate analyte quantification using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection was then obtained using a Thermofisher Quantiva triple-quadrupole MS coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC. The method has been validated following international (EMA) guidelines for bioanalytical method validation and has been tested on plasma samples from 62 CF patients treated with the three-drug combination IVA/TEZ/ELX, marketed as Kaftrio® or Trikafta®, in steady-state condition. The assay was linear over wide concentration ranges (0.008–12 mg/L) in plasma for IVA, TEZ, and ELX, suitable for a broad range of plasma concentrations, and accurate and reproducible in the absence of matrix effects. The stability of analytes for at least 30 days at room temperature could allow for cost-effective shipment and storage. On the same day of sample collection, a sweat test was evaluated for 26 associated patients’ samples, FEV1 (%) for 58, and BMI was calculated for 62. However, Spearman correlation showed no correlation between Cthrough plasma concentrations of analytes (IVA, TEZ, ELX) and sweat test, FEV1 (%), or BMI. Our method proved to be suitable for TDM and could be helpful in assessing dose–concentration–response correlations in larger studies.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63176aee09c232eddb00773d8a409a8267a773c2

Brother thing guy.;Poster;Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), and are generally well-tolerated; however, real-world studies indicate the frequency of discontinuation and adverse events (AEs) may be higher than what was observed in clinical trials. The objectives of this systematic review were to summarize real-world AEs reported for market-available CFTR modulators (i.e., ivacaftor (IVA), lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA), tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA), and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)), and to identify ways in which the pharmacist on CF healthcare teams may contribute to mitigating and managing these AEs. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science Core Collection online databases were searched from 2012 to 1 Aug 2020. Full manuscripts or conference abstracts of observational studies, case series, and case reports were eligible for inclusion. The included full manuscripts and conference abstracts comprised of 54 observational studies, 5 case series, and 9 case reports. The types of AEs reported generally aligned with what have been observed in clinical trials. LUM/IVA was associated with a higher frequency of respiratory-related AE and discontinuation in real-world studies. A signal for mental health and neurocognitive AEs was identified with all 4 CFTR modulators. A systematic approach to monitoring for AEs in people with CF on CFTR modulators in the real-world setting is necessary to help better understand potential AEs, as well as patient characteristics that may be associated with higher risk of certain AEs. Pharmacists play a key role in the safe initiation and monitoring of people with CF on CFTR modulator therapies.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f308b1ed2bd1a4c25cbea30cab88749538422665

These “caftor” drugs are mainly metabolized by cytochromes P450 3A, whose enzymatic activity is influenced by environmental factors, and are sensitive to inhibition and induction. Hence, CFTR modulators are characterized by an important interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and are also prone to drug–drug interactions. However, these CFTR modulators are given at standardized dosages, while they meet all criteria for a formal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) program that should be considered in cases of clinical toxicity, less-than-expected clinical response, drug or food interactions, distinct patient subgroups (i.e., pediatrics), and for monitoring short-term adherence.

Its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 has expanded the target therapy group to individuals aged twelve and up with at least one Phe508del (phenylalanine 508 deletion) mutation in the CFTR gene. This systematic review aims to assess this combination therapy's safety and efficacy. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, an in-depth search was performed. The search was done by utilizing databases such as PubMed Central (PMC), Google Scholar, and Science Direct for articles related to this topic. Studies published in the last five years in the English language were chosen preliminarily. Further eligibility criteria and quality assessment tools were employed to assess the risk of bias and finalize ten articles to be used in this review. The chosen articles constituted four randomized control trials (RCTs), four systematic reviews, and two narrative reviews. The last date for data collection was April 24, 2022. Based on the findings of this review, we concluded that by combining three CFTR modulators, this therapy had outperformed all the currently available medications in terms of improving pulmonary function, reducing exacerbations, and enhancing the quality of life of CF patients. In clinical trials, headache and rash were the most common side effects, and laboratory testing to assess liver function is suggested. Long-term safety and effectiveness must be confirmed by the continued review of real-life patient data. Studies done on triple therapy thus far have been promising. Unfortunately, a small proportion of the CF population remains ineligible for any form of CFTR modulator therapy owing to their type of genetic mutation, and this provides ground for further research in this field.;Yes;No;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b10ba1faa4be79c5499b759be3079a94087bea9

The discovery of the association between CFTR and the hyperactive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) has raised the question of the influence of ENaC on the clinical CF phenotype. ENaC disturbance contributes to the pathological secretion, and overexpression of one ENaC subunit, the β-unit, can give a CF-like phenotype in mice with normal acting CFTR. The development of ENaC channel modulators is now in progress. Both CFTR and ENaC are located in the cell membrane and are influenced by its lipid configuration. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the interaction of lipids and these proteins in the membranes. Linoleic acid deficiency is the most prevailing lipid abnormality in CF, and linoleic acid is an important constituent of membranes. The influence on sodium excretion by linoleic acid supplementation indicates that lipid-protein interaction is of importance for the clinical pathophysiology in CF. Further studies of this association can imply a simple clinical adjuvant in CF therapy.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d316c52884abe01159c81d222ba1c19cecb2120

Finding solutions for rare diseases can be very challenging for physicians and researchers. Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic, autosomal recessive, multisystemic, life-limiting disease does not escape this sad reality. Despite phenomenal progress in our understanding of this disease, treatment remains difficult. Until recently, therapies for CF individuals were focused on symptom management. The discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and its product, a protein present at the apical surface of epithelial cells regulating ion transport, allowed the scientific community to learn about the basic defect in CF and to study potential therapies targeting the dysfunctional protein. In the past few years, promising therapies with the goal to restore CFTR function became available and changed the lives of several CF patients. These medications, called CFTR modulators, aim to correct, potentialize, stabilize or amplify CFTR function. Furthermore, research is ongoing to develop other targeted therapies that could be more efficient and benefit a larger proportion of the CF community. The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of CF genetics and therapies restoring CFTR function, particularly CFTR modulators and gene therapy.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/958a5a443de5228128334d14970a5649e39c0409

Since the first clinical descriptions in the 1930s, treatment advances had focused on the downstream consequences of a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel. The discovery of the gene that codes for CFTR and an understanding of the way in which different genetic mutations lead to disruption of normal CFTR function have led to the creation and subsequent licensing of drugs that target this process. This marks an important move towards precision medicine in CF and results from clinical trials and real-world clinical practice have been impressive. In this review we outline how CFTR modulator drugs restore function to the CFTR protein and the progress that is being made in this field. We also describe the real-world impact of CFTR modulators on both pulmonary and multisystem complications of CF and what this will mean for the future of CF care.

This causes multisystem disease due to dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel at the apical surface of epithelia. Until recently, treatment was directed at managing the downstream effects in affected organs, principally improving airway clearance and treating infection in the lungs and improving malabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Care delivered by multidisciplinary teams has yielded incremental improvements in outcomes. However, the development of small-molecule CFTR modulator drugs over the last decade has heralded a new era of CF therapeutics. Modulators target the underlying defect and improve CFTR function. Either monotherapy or a combination of modulators is used depending on the specific genotype and class of CFTR disease-causing variants that an individual has. Both ivacaftor and the ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor combination have been demonstrated to be associated with clinically very significant benefits in randomised trials and have rapidly been made available as part of standard care in many countries. CFTR modulators represent one of the best examples of precision medicine to date. They are expensive, however, and equity of access to them worldwide remains an issue. Studies and approvals are also ongoing for children under the age of 6 years for ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. Furthermore, no modulators are available for around 10% of the people with CF. In this review, we firstly summarise the genetics, pathophysiology and clinical problems associated with CF. We then discuss the development of CFTR modulators and key clinical trials to support their use along with other potential future therapeutic approaches.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/547241446e1ed6b93a469ba57af64efcda209583

This creates a therapeutic challenge to the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to the potential for significant drug–drug interactions (DDIs). However, the population with CF is more at risk of serious illness following COVID‐19 infection and hence it is important to manage the DDI risk and provide treatment options. CYP3A‐mediated DDI of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor was evaluated using a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling approach. Modeling was performed incorporating physiological information and drug‐dependent parameters of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to predict the effect of ritonavir (the CYP3A inhibiting component of the combination) on the pharmacokinetics of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. The elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor models were verified using independent clinical pharmacokinetic and DDI data of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with a range of CYP3A modulators. When ritonavir was administered on Days 1 through 5, the predicted area under the curve (AUC) ratio of ivacaftor (the most sensitive CYP3A substrate) on Day 6 was 9.31, indicating that its metabolism was strongly inhibited. Based on the predicted DDI, the dose of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor should be reduced when coadministered with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir to elexacaftor 200 mg–tezacaftor 100 mg–ivacaftor 150 mg on Days 1 and 5, with delayed resumption of full‐dose elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor on Day 9, considering the residual inhibitory effect of ritonavir as a mechanism‐based inhibitor.

Language color amount that who fast., Computer community feeling either claim.;ShortPaper;Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, progressive, multi-organ genetic disease. Ivacaftor, a small-molecule CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator, was the first medication to treat the underlying cause of CF. Since its approval, real-world clinical experience on the use of ivacaftor has been documented in large registries and smaller studies. Here, we systematically review data from real-world observational studies of ivacaftor treatment in people with CF (pwCF). Searches of MEDLINE and Embase identified 368 publications reporting real-world studies that enrolled six or more pwCF treated with ivacaftor published between January 2012 and September 2019. Overall, 75 publications providing data from 57 unique studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Studies reporting within-group change for pwCF treated with ivacaftor consistently showed improvements in lung function, nutritional parameters, and patient-reported respiratory and sino-nasal symptoms. Benefits were evident as early as 1 month following ivacaftor initiation and were sustained over long-term follow-up. Decreases in pulmonary exacerbations, Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence, and healthcare resource utilization also were reported for up to 66 months following ivacaftor initiation. In studies comparing ivacaftor treatment to modulator untreated comparator groups, clinical benefits similarly were reported as were decreases in mortality, organ-transplantation, and CF-related complications. The safety profile of ivacaftor observed in these real-world studies was consistent with the well-established safety profile based on clinical trial data. Our systematic review of real-world studies shows ivacaftor treatment in pwCF results in highly consistent and sustained clinical benefit in both pulmonary and non-pulmonary outcomes across various geographies, study designs, patient characteristics, and follow-up durations, confirming and expanding upon evidence from clinical trials.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d64bb9828df9aa504bbc1e76390379b58935c7dd

These modulators show robust treatment effects at group level in pwCF with specific mutations. The individual effect however, is variable. In this review we will explain reasons for reconsideration of dosing regimens of CFTR modulating therapy in order to improve treatment response and prevent side effects. Since the effect of a drug depends on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties of CFTR modulators will be discussed. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships will be used to gain insight in dosage response and exposure response relationships. To understand the cause of variation in drug exposure, pharmacokinetic properties that may change due to CF disease will be explained. We show that with current insight, there are conceivable situations that give reason for reconsideration of dosing regimens, however many questions need to be unravelled.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc0665539acd84e229446c859eb134f157465662

Store father wrong have write relate control new.;DemoPaper;In the course of their missions or training, alpinists, but also mountain combat forces and mountain security services, professional miners, aircrew, aircraft and glider pilots and helicopter crews are regularly exposed to altitude without oxygen supplementation. At altitude, humans are exposed to systemic environmental hypoxia induced by the decrease in barometric pressure (<1,013 hPa) which decreases the inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PIO2), while the oxygen fraction is constant (equal to approximately 20.9%). Effects of altitude on humans occur gradually and depend on the duration of exposure and the altitude level. From 1,500 m altitude (response threshold), several adaptive responses offset the effects of hypoxia, involving the respiratory and the cardiovascular systems, and the oxygen transport capacity of the blood. Fatigue and cognitive and sensory disorders are usually observed from 2,500 m (threshold of prolonged hypoxia). Above 3,500 m (the threshold for disorders), the effects are not completely compensated and maladaptive responses occur and individuals develop altitude headache or acute altitude illness [Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)]. The magnitude of effects varies considerably between different physiological systems and exhibits significant inter-individual variability. In addition to comorbidities, the factors of vulnerability are still little known. They can be constitutive (genetic) or circumstantial (sleep deprivation, fatigue, speed of ascent.). In particular, sleep loss, a condition that is often encountered in real-life settings, could have an impact on the physiological and cognitive responses to hypoxia. In this review, we report the current state of knowledge on the impact of sleep loss on responses to environmental hypoxia in humans, with the aim of identifying possible consequences for AMS risk and cognition, as well as the value of behavioral and non-pharmacological countermeasures.;Yes;Yes;2022;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8481f4eb86393a68e2fddc2bed9a5ac841fd9618

Materials and methods We selected 30 patients with HACE diagnosed between January 2012 to August 2022 as the experimental group and 60 patients with dizziness on traveling from the plain to the plateau or from lower altitude to higher altitude in a short period of time as the control group. We collected general clinical data from the experimental group and classified it according to clinical symptoms. In both groups, we then performed a head CT and multi-sequence MRI (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, and DWI). Among them, nine patients with HACE were also scanned using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Finally, we analyzed the images. Results According to clinical symptoms, we divided the 30 cases of HACE into 12 mild cases and 18 severe cases. There was no significant difference in sex, age, leukocyte, neutrophil, or glucose content between mild and severe HACE. The sensitivity and specificity of the MRI diagnosis were 100 and 100%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of the CT diagnosis were 23.3 and 100%, respectively. The distribution range of deep and juxtacortical white matter edema was significantly larger in severe HACE than in mild HACE (p < 0.001). The corpus callosum edema distribution range in severe HACE was significantly larger than that in mild HACE (p = 0.001). The ADC value of the splenium of the corpus callosum was significantly lower in severe HACE than in mild HACE (p = 0.049). In mild and severe HACE, the signal intensity of the DWI sequence was significantly higher than that of conventional MRI sequences (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR) (p = 0.008, p = 0.025, respectively). In severe HACE, seven cases showed bilateral corticospinal tract edema at the thalamic level, and SWI showed cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in five cases, especially in the corpus callosum. Conclusions MRI has more advantages than CT in the evaluation of HACE, especially in the DWI sequence. The white matter injury of severe HACE is more severe and extensive, especially in the corpus callosum, and some CMBs and corticospinal tract edema may also appear.;Yes;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b8cec3c7edf64cdff5468fc000619466859f020

Girl difficult nice church exist reveal.;FullPaper;INTRODUCTION: A study was performed to evaluate a cockpit flight simulation suite for measuring moderate altitude effects in a limited subject group. Objectives were to determine whether the apparatus can detect subtle deterioration, record physiological processes throughout hypobaric exposure, and assess recovery.METHODS: Eight subjects trained to perform precision instrument control (PICT) flight and unusual attitude recovery (UAR) and completed chamber flights dedicated to the PICT and UAR, respectively. Each flight comprised five epochs, including ground level pressure (GLP), ascent through altitude plateaus at 10,000, 14,000, and 17,500 ft (3050, 4270, and 5338 m), then postexposure recovery. PICT performance was assessed using control error (FSE) and time-out-of-bounds (TOOB) when pilots exited the flight corridor. UARs were assessed using response times needed to initiate correction and to achieve wings-level attitude. Physiological indices included Spo₂, heart rate (HR), end tidal O₂ and CO₂ pressures, and respiration metrics.RESULTS: Seven subjects completed both flights. PICT performance deteriorated at altitude: FSE increased 33% at 17,513 ft and 21% in Recovery vs. GLP. Mean TOOB increased from 11 s at GLP to 60 s in Recovery. UAR effects were less clear, with some evidence of accelerated responses during and after ascent.CONCLUSIONS: The test paradigm was shown to be effective; piloting impairment was detected during and after exposure. Physiological channels recorded a combination of hypoxia, elevated ventilation, and hypocapnia during ascent, followed by respiratory slowing in recovery. Findings indicate precision piloting and respiration are subject to changes during moderate altitude exposure and may remain altered after Spo₂ recovers, and changes may be linked to hypocapnia.Beer J, Morse B, Dart T, Adler S, Sherman P.

Little close entire dark determine begin behind.;DemoPaper;Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are described as exhibiting oxygen levels incompatible with life without dyspnea. The pairing—dubbed happy hypoxia but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia—is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology. This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals. It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia. These mechanisms include the way dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, the way the prevailing carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) blunts the brain’s response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve. Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for patients with hypoxemia free of dyspnea are operating in the dark, placing vulnerable patients with COVID-19 at considerable risk. In conclusion, features of COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.;Yes;Yes;2020;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38570eb0cc685f77cf4a1aa85e79a1288bced13d

The reason for this intersubject-variability of the responses is still not completely understood. This study is performed with 32 healthy subjects, using the systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) approach. We investigate the intersubject variability of hemodynamic and systemic physiological responses, due to a verbal fluency task (VFT) under colored light exposure (CLE; blue and red). Five and seven different hemodynamic response patterns were detected in the subgroup analysis of the blue and red light exposure, respectively. We also found that arterial oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure were positively correlated with [O2Hb] at the prefrontal cortex during the CLE-VFT independent of the color of light and classification of the subjects. Our study finds that there is substantial intersubject-variability of cerebral hemodynamic responses, which is partially explained by subject-specific systemic physiological changes induced by the CLE-VFT. This means that both subgroup analyses and the additional assessment of systemic physiology are of crucial importance to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the effects of a CLE-VFT on human subjects.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb82e7790230dc2bfcb72af741fdd8b49717988

Term not more image community through sure main.;FullPaper;Background: Finger pulse oximeters are widely used to monitor physiological responses to high-altitude exposure, the progress of acclimatization, and/or the potential development of high-altitude related diseases. Although there is increasing evidence for its invaluable support at high altitude, some controversy remains, largely due to differences in individual preconditions, evaluation purposes, measurement methods, the use of different devices, and the lacking ability to interpret data correctly. Therefore, this review is aimed at providing information on the functioning of pulse oximeters, appropriate measurement methods and published time courses of pulse oximetry data (peripheral oxygen saturation, (SpO2) and heart rate (HR), recorded at rest and submaximal exercise during exposure to various altitudes. Results: The presented findings from the literature review confirm rather large variations of pulse oximetry measures (SpO2 and HR) during acute exposure and acclimatization to high altitude, related to the varying conditions between studies mentioned above. It turned out that particularly SpO2 levels decrease with acute altitude/hypoxia exposure and partly recover during acclimatization, with an opposite trend of HR. Moreover, the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) was consistently associated with lower SpO2 values compared to individuals free from AMS. Conclusions: The use of finger pulse oximetry at high altitude is considered as a valuable tool in the evaluation of individual acclimatization to high altitude but also to monitor AMS progression and treatment efficacy.;Yes;No;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af6b1dacab287350c4cdd4de9f1e2e733f939c7e

Right billion suddenly stage foot.;ShortPaper;Acute hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is a major physiological threat during high-altitude flight and operations. In military aviation, although hypoxia-related fatalities are rare, incidences are common and are likely underreported. Hypoxia is a reduction in oxygen availability, which can impair brain function and performance of operational and safety-critical tasks. HH occurs at high altitude, due to the reduction in atmospheric oxygen pressure. This physiological state is also partially simulated in normobaric environments for training and research, by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to achieve comparable tissue oxygen saturation [normobaric hypoxia (NH)]. Hypoxia can occur in susceptible individuals below 10,000 ft (3,048 m) in unpressurised aircrafts and at higher altitudes in pressurised environments when life support systems malfunction or due to improper equipment use. Between 10,000 ft and 15,000 ft (4,572 m), brain function is mildly impaired and hypoxic symptoms are common, although both are often difficult to accurately quantify, which may partly be due to the effects of hypocapnia. Above 15,000 ft, brain function exponentially deteriorates with increasing altitude until loss of consciousness. The period of effective and safe performance of operational tasks following exposure to hypoxia is termed the time-of-useful-consciousness (TUC). Recovery of brain function following hypoxia may also lag beyond arterial reoxygenation and could be exacerbated by repeated hypoxic exposures or hyperoxic recovery. This review provides an overview of the basic physiology and implications of hypoxia for military aviation and discusses the utility of hypoxia recognition training.;Yes;Yes;2021;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/084a3e54aa542980dc2560713b01144d4674e638

Cerebral (Sco₂) and peripheral tissue (Sto₂) oxygen saturations can be measured using near infra-red spectroscopy. In a project simulating oxygen system failure during high altitude-high opening parachuting (HAHO), Sao₂, Spo₂, Sco₂, and forearm Sto₂ were measured. The aim of the present analysis was to explore the agreement between Sao₂ and the three noninvasive measurements of hypoxemia (Spo₂, Sco₂, and Sto₂).METHODS: Healthy volunteers from the Norwegian Special Operations Commando were studied in a hypobaric chamber as supplemental oxygen was removed at 301 hPa ambient pressure (30,000 ft) and recompressed at 25 hPa · min-1 (1000 ft · min-1) to ground level simulating a HAHO parachute flight. Sao₂ was compared with Spo₂, Sco₂, and Sto₂ in scatterplots and Bland-Altman plots, calculating bias and limits of agreement (LOA).RESULTS: The bias ± LOA were: Sao₂ vs. Spo₂: -5.8% ± 16, Sao₂ vs. Sco₂: -3.4% ± 11, and Sao₂ vs. Sto₂: 17% ± 30. The bias for Sao₂ vs. Spo₂ was dependent on the range of values, and correcting for this with a sloped bias line reduced the LOA to ± 8.2%.DISCUSSION: There were wide limits of agreement between Sao₂ and Spo₂. Sao₂ and Sco₂ agreed better, whereas Sao₂ and forearm Sto₂ had wide LOA. The agreement between Sao₂ and Spo₂ improved when correcting for the underestimation of Spo₂ at low values. There is a poor agreement between Spo₂ and the gold standard Sao₂ during extreme hypobaric hypoxemia.Ottestad W, Kåsin JI, Høiseth LØ.

Acute exposure protocols have been designed in hypobaric chambers to train aircrews to recognize hypoxia and quickly take corrective actions. The goal of the acute hypoxia test is to know the time of useful consciousness and the minimal arterial oxygen saturation tolerated. Currently, there is no computer system specifically designed to analyze the physiological variables obtained during the test. This paper reports the development and analytical capabilities of a computational tool specially designed for these purposes. The procedure was designed using the Igor Pro 8.01 language, which processes oxygen saturation and heart rate signals. To accomplish this, three functional boards are displayed. The first allows the loading and processing of the data. The second generates graphs that allow for a rapid visual examination to determine the validity of individual records and calculate slopes on selected segments of the recorded signal. Finally, the third can apply filters to generate data groups for analysis. In addition, this tool makes it possible to propose new study variables that are derived from the raw signals and can be applied simultaneously to large data sets. The program can generate graphs accompanied by basic statistical parameters and heat maps that facilitate data visualization. Moreover, there is a possibility of adding other signals during the test, such as the oxygenation level in vital organs, electrocardiogram, or electroencephalogram, which illustrates the test’s excellent potential for application in aerospace medicine and for helping us develop a better understanding of complex physiological phenomena.;No;Yes;2023;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01f449f32fd182ead3651968cc487b9dd128db8e
